# Contributing to the TTRPG Share

We're always happy to receive a pull request. See a typo? Feel free to fix it! No PR is too big or too small.

When contributing to this repository on larger content, please first ensure you've reviewed some of the other submissions in the area you want to submit content to, and have included a Read-Me in your submission.

All contributions are subject to theÂ **[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/)**.

## Pull Request Required Practices

1. Ensure any installation or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. If our .gitignore doesn't filter out this content, submit a separate Pull Request to have that priority updated.

2. Slugify your file names.
  a. Top-level folders should be all tile-case, and use hyphens instead of spaces.
  b. Sub-folders should be all lower-case, and use hyphens instead of spaces.

3. No special characters in file names.

4. Include a general description of what you're submitting.

5. Licenses in this repository are MIT by default. If you operate under a different license, please include it with your submission.

6. Wiki Links, while technically accepted, do prevent users from easily finding your linked content while outside the Obsidian Vault. Please consider using Markdown links. 

7. Relevant Linking is preferred to maintain cohesion between submitter and downloader.


### Optional

1. If you're a contributor with a Ko.Fi, patreon, or other similar link, add yourself to the dice roll table at the bottom of the Readme.
