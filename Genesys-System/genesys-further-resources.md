## Obsidian-Genesys

**Repository Link**: [Craftidore/Obsidian-Genesys](https://github.com/Craftidore/Obsidian-Genesys)

**Summary**: 

This repository is dedicated to compiling and creating various tools to make Obsidian more friendly to Genesys system players, who currently lack a space in the D20 dominated environment. Currently, this repository has the following resources.

1. A CSS Snippet for placing Star Wars RPG and Genesys dice images into your notes.

2. A Star Wars RPG and Genesys statblock layout for the [Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-5e-statblocks) plugin.

The repository owner asks that if you have any Genesys specific content to add, that you please make a pull request. While you are at it, it would be appreciated if you would do the same for the TTRPGShare.
