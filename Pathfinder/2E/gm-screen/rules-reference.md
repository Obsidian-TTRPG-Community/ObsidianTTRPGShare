# Death and Dying
**Knocked Out** When reduced to 0 HP, move your initiative to directly before the creature or effect that reduced you to 0 HP. Gain dying 1, or dying 2 if the damage came from a critical hit or your critical failure on a save. A nonlethal effect makes you unconscious at 0 HP and doesn’t give you the dying condition.

**Dying** You are unconscious. If you ever reach dying 4, you die. Attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn to determine whether you get better or worse. If you ever have 1 HP or more, you lose the dying condition. Any time you lose the dying condition, increase your wounded value by 1. If you take damage while dying, increase the dying value by 1 (or 2 on an enemy’s critical success or your critical failure).

**Recovery Checks** At the start of your turn when you’re dying, attempt a flat check (DC 10 + your dying value).
- **Critical Success** Your dying value is reduced by 2.
- **Success** Your dying value is reduced by 1.
- **Failure** Your dying value increases by 1.
- **Critical Failure** Your dying value increases by 2.

**Wounded** Any time you gain the dying condition or increase it for any reason, add your wounded value to the amount you gain or increase your dying value. The wounded condition ends if you receive HP from Treat Wounds, or if you’re restored to full HP and rest for 10 minutes.

**Doomed** The maximum dying value at which you die is reduced by your doomed value. If your maximum dying value is reduced to 0, you instantly die. Your doomed value decreases by 1 each time you get a full night’s rest.

# Unconscious 
You can’t wake up from unconsciousness while you have 0 Hit Points. If you’re unconscious and have 1 or more Hit Points, you wake up in one of five ways.
• You take damage, provided the damage doesn’t drop you to 0 HP.
• You receive healing, other than natural healing from resting.
• Someone nudges or shakes you awake with an Interact action.
• If there’s loud noise, at the start of your turn attempt a Perception check against the noise’s DC, waking up if you succeed. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet, this uses their Stealth DC.
• The GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night’s sleep or something disrupted that restful sleep.

# Treat Wounds

| Proficiency | DC  | Success Healing | Critical Healing |
| ----------- | --- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Trained     | 15  | 2d8             | 4d8              |

| Master*     | 30  | 2d8+30          | 4d8+30           |
| Legendary*  | 40  | 2d8+50          | 4d8+50           |

*Rolling against a higher DC is optional. 

# Terrain 

**Difficult Terrain** Each square costs 5 extra feet of movement.
**Greater Difficult Terrain** Each square costs 10 extra feet of movement.
**Hazardous Terrain** Moving through hazardous terrain deals damage.
**Narrow Surface** Flat-footed and must Balance to cross. When you’re hit or fail a save, succeed at a Reflex save or fall.
**Uneven Ground** Flat-footed and might need to Balance or fall prone. When you’re hit or fail a save, succeed at a Reflex save or fall.
**Incline** You need to Climb to ascend an incline. You’re flat-footed while Climbing.

# Cover
Draw a line from the center of the attacker’s space or burst to the center of the target’s space.
**Lesser Cover** +1 circumstance bonus to AC if line passes through creatures but no objects.
**Cover** +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Reflex saves against area effects, and Stealth checks to Hide or Sneak. You can use Take Cover (Core 471) to increase this to greater cover.
**Greater Cover** As cover, but a +4 bonus.

# Hero Points
Give out 1 Hero Point to each PC at the start of the session. Give out roughly 1 more per hour of play, for a heroic act or a moderate or major accomplishment. Hero Points can be spent in two ways.
**Spend 1 Hero Point** to reroll a check and use the second result. This is a fortune effect.
**Spend all your Hero Points** to avoid death. You can do this when your dying condition would increase. Lose the dying condition and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. Don’t gain or increase your wounded value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition you don’t lose it or decrease it.

# Specific Skill DCs
**Craft** Use a DC of the item’s level, adjusted for rarity.
**Earn Income Tasks** The task level is typically the settlement’s level, and its DC uses the task level. Typical levels: village 0–1, town 2–4, city 5–7.
**Gather Information** Set a simple DC based on the notoriety of the subject; adjust upward if the character seeks in-depth information.
**Identify Magic or Learn a Spell** Use the DC for the spell or item’s level, adjusted by rarity; use the incredibly hard adjustment for cursed items.
**Recall Knowledge** Set a simple DC; if the character tries again for more knowledge, adjust the DC one step higher each time until they fail or attempt an incredibly hard check.
**Sense Direction** Pick a simple DC: trained in normal wilderness, expert in deep forest/underground, master or legendary in weird/surreal environments.
**Social Skills** Use Will DC if known; if not, improvise a level.
**Track** Select a simple DC, or a Survival DC if the quarry Covers Tracks.

# Creature Identification 
Use the creature’s level, adjusted for rarity and fame. Success recalls a well-known attribute; critical success adds something more subtle.

# Detecting Creatures

**Observed** A creature you’re observed by knows where you are and can target you normally.
**Concealed** A creature that you’re concealed from must succeed at a DC 5 flat check when targeting you with a non-area effect.
**Hidden** A creature you’re hidden from knows the space you’re in. It is flat-footed to you, and must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to affect you. You can Hide to become hidden, and Seek to find hidden creatures.
**Undetected** When you are undetected by a creature, it’s flat-footed to you, can’t see you, has no idea what space you occupy, and can’t target you. It can try to guess your square by picking a square and attempting an attack. This works like targeting a hidden creature, but the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM.
**Unnoticed** A creature you’re unnoticed by is totally unaware of your presence.
**Invisible** You’re undetected by everyone. You can’t become observed while invisible except via special abilities or magic.

# Exploration Activities
You must move at half speed to use any of these activities.
**Avoid Notice** Use Stealth to avoid being noticed.
**Defend** Raise a Shield before your first turn begins.
**Detect Magic** (concentrate) Detect magic at regular intervals.
**Follow the Expert** (audible, concentration, visual) Gain bonus with a skill from an expert ally. Add your level if untrained, and get +2 circumstance bonus (+3 if ally is master, +4 if ally is legendary).
**Hustle** Move at double Speed for up to Con × 10 minutes (minimum 10 minutes).
**Investigate** (concentrate) Use Recall Knowledge to discover clues.
**Repeat a Spell** (concentrate) Repeatedly cast the same spell, or continue Activation or Sustain a Spell.
**Scout** (concentrate) Party members get +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls.
**Search** (concentrate) Seek for hidden doors and hazards.

# Falling Damage
When you fall more than 5 feet, take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell. If you take any damage, you land prone. If you fall into water or a soft substance, calculate damage as though the fall were 20 feet shorter, 30 if you intentionally dove in (up to the depth of the substance).
