## Vault Moved

Due to the size of the PF2E Community vault, and the creation of the Obsidian-Community Project, the community PF2E vault has been given its own home/repository.

[Click this line to be taken to the repository for the SRD content](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/Pathfinder-2E-SRD-Markdown). 

Additionally, we have created directories for PF1E and PF2E content for tools or content that are outside of official Paizo distribution, but useful to players and GMs, such as custom character sheets or templates.
