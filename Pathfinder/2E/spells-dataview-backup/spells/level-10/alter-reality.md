description: >
  You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:

  &Newline;Duplicate any occult spell of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
  &Newline;Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.
  &Newline;Produce any effect whose power is in line with the above.
  &Newline;Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[Wish]] spell.

  At the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.
