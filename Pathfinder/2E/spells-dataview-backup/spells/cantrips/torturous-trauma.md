description: >
  With this spell born of Kemnebi's sadistic love of torture, you batter a creature's internal organs, leaving no external signs of the immense pain you delivered. The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier with a basic Fortitude save. If it critically fails, the target is also [[Fatigued]] until the start of your next turn. Creatures that lack internal organs are unaffected by this spell.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d4.
