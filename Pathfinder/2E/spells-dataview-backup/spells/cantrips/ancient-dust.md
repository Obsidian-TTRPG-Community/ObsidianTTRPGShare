  You cough up a cloud of gray soil, echoing the dust in the graves of Kemnebi's many victims. Each creature in the area takes negative damage equal to your spellcasting modifier and 1 persistent negative damage depending on its Fortitude save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The creature takes half damage and no persistent damage.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature takes full damage and persistent damage.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and double the persistent damage.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The initial negative damage increases by 1d6, and the persistent damage increases by 1.
