description: >
  A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a spell attack roll against your target's AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach.
  On a success, you deal 1d4 fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 1d4 and the [[Persistent Damage]] on a critical hit by 1d4.
