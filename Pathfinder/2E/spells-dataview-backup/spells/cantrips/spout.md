description: >
  Area 5-foot cube or 5-foot burst

  Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the area take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, with a basic Reflex saving throw.
  You can change this spell's area to a 5-foot burst, provided you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle or bathtub.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
