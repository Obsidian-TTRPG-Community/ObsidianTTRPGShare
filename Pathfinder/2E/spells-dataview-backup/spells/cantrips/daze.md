  You cloud the target's mind and daze it with a mental jolt. The jolt deals mental damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; the target must attempt a basic Will save. If the target critically fails the save, it is also [[Stunned]] 1.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
