description: >
  You temporarily morph your limb into a clawed appendage. Make a melee spell attack roll against your target's AC. If you hit, you deal your choice of slashing or piercing damage equal to 1d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage plus 1d4 persistent Bleed damage.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 and the persistent bleed damage on a critical increases by 1d4.
