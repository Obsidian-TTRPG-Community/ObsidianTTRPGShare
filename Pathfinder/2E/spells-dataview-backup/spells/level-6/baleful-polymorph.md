description: >
  You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be [[Sickened]] 1. When it recovers from the Sickened condition, its features revert to normal.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.
