description: >
  You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from spellwrack, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the [[Persistent Damage]]; the curse and the Persistent Damage end after 1 minute.
  &NewLine;**Failure** As success, but the curse and Persistent Damage do not end on their own.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12 persistent force damage.
