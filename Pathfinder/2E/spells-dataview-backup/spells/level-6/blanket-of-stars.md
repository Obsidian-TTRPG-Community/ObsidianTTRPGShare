description: >
  A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak.
  While outside under a starry night sky, you're also [[Invisible]] as long as you remain still. When moving under a starry night sky, you are [[Concealed]] instead.
  Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, visual effect.

  &NewLine;**Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature is [[Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Confused]] and Dazzled until the end of its next turn.
