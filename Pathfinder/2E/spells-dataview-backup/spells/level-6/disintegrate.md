description: >
  You fire a green ray at your target. Make a spell attack. On a hit, you deal 12d10 damage, and the target must attempt a basic Fortitude save. On a critical hit, treat the save result as one degree worse. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder; its gear remains. An object you hit is destroyed (no save), regardless of Hardness, unless it's an artifact or similarly hard to destroy. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. This automatically destroys any force construct, such as a wall of force.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d10.
