description: >
  You try to turn the target's flesh into stone. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is [[Slowed]] 1 for 1 round.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is [[Slowed]] 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the Slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the Slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the Slowed condition from flesh to stone, the creature is permanently non-magically [[Petrified]]. The spell ends if the creature is Petrified or the Slowed condition is removed.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is initially [[Slowed]] 2.
