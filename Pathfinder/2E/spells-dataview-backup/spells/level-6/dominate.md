description: >
  You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is [[Stunned]] 1 as it fights off your commands.
  &NewLine;**Failure** You control the target. It gains the [[Controlled]] condition, but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (10th)** The duration is unlimited.
