description: >
  You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and collapse structures. The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass of quicksand.

  Shaking Ground The ground is difficult terrain, and creatures on it take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks.
  Fissures Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require successful DC 15 climb to Climb.
  Collapse Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 Flat check for a sturdy structure, DC 14 Flat check for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 Flat check for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage.
  &NewLine;**Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls [[Prone]].
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls Prone.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (10th)** You create a massive earthquake that can devastate a settlement. The range increases to half a mile and the area to a quarter-mile burst.
