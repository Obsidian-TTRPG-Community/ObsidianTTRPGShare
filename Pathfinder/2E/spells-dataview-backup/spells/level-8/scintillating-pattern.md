description: >
  A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air. Creatures are [[Dazzled]] while inside the pattern, as are those within 20 feet of the pattern's area. A creature must attempt a Will save if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.

  &NewLine;**Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature is [[Confused]] for 1d4 rounds.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Stunned]] for 1d4 rounds. After the Stunned condition ends, the creature is Confused for the remaining duration of the spell.
