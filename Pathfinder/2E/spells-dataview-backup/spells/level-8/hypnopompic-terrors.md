description: >
  You send a wave of nightmarish visions crashing over your targets, leaving them [[Paralyzed]] by fear. These visions inflict real wounds on vulnerable targets, dealing 6d12 mental damage. If you target a sleeping creature, it wakes up as it attempts the save but takes one degree of success worse than the result it rolled on its save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is [[Frightened]] 2 and takes half the mental damage.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is frightened 2, is [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round, and takes the full mental damage.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target is frightened 2, is paralyzed for 2 rounds, and takes double the mental damage.
