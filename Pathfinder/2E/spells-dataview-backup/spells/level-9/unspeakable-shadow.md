description: >
  You alter a creature's shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. The creature must attempt a Will save. A creature that has the frightened condition from unspeakable shadow must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a Strike ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the fleeing condition).

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is [[Frightened]] 2.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is [[Frightened]] 3. It can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must succeed at a Fortitude save or die; this saving throw has the incapacitation trait. If it succeeds at its save, the target is [[Frightened]] 4 and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.
