description: >
  Fleeting notes of a strange and unnatural song fill the air, overtaking the mind. Each target must attempt a Will save when you cast the spell, and again the first time you Sustain this Spell each round. A creature needs to attempt only one save against the song each round, and you have to keep the same targets when you Sustain the Spell.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected, can't be affected on subsequent rounds, and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is unaffected this round, but it can be affected on subsequent rounds.
  &NewLine;**Failure** Roll 1d4 on the table below.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** Roll 1d4+1 on the table below.
