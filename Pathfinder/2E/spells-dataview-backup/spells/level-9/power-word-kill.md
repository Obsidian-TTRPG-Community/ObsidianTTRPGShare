description: >
  You utter the most powerful arcane word of power. Once targeted, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level.

  &NewLine;**14th or Lower** The target dies instantly.
  &NewLine;**15th** If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes [[Dying]] 1, or increases its Dying condition by 1 if it's already Dying.
  &NewLine;**16th or Higher** The target takes 50 damage; if this brings the target to 0 Hit Points, the target dies instantly.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (10th)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2.
