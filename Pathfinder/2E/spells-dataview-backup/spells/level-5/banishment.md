description: >
  You send the target back to its home plane. The target must attempt a Will save. You can spend an extra action while Casting this Spell and add a material component to give the creature a -2 circumstance penalty to its save. The component must be a specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature, and not from a material component pouch. This spell fails if you aren't on your home plane when you cast it.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target resists being banished and you are [[Stunned]] 1.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target resists being banished.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is banished.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target is banished and can't return by any means to the plane it's banished from for 1 week.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures. The extra material component affects targets to which it is anathema.
