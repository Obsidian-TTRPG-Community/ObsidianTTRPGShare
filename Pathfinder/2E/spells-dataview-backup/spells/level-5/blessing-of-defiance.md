  Channeling forth the power to persevere in the face of adversity, you grant the target the means to deny danger and avoid dire harm. Choose one saving throw: Fortitude, Reflex, or Will. The target gets a +4 status bonus to that saving throw for 1 round. The potency and number of targets of this blessing depend on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.

  1 (somatic) The spell targets you or one willing ally within range.
  2 (verbal) The spell targets you or one willing ally within range. If you choose Fortitude, the target gains resistance 15 to poison. If you choose Reflex, the target gains a +15-foot status bonus to its Speeds. If you choose Will, the target gains resistance 15 to mental damage.
  3 (verbal) The spell targets you and all willing allies within 30 feet.
