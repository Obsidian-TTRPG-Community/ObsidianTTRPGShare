  You call upon the power of the planes to transform into a Medium elemental battle form. When you cast this spell, choose air, earth, fire, or water. While in this form, you gain the corresponding trait and the elemental trait. You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions. You can Dismiss the spell.
  You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

  &NewLine;AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
  &NewLine;10 temporary Hit Points.
  &NewLine;Darkvision.
  &NewLine;One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +18, and your damage bonus is +9. These are Dexterity based (air or fire) or Strength based (earth or water). If your corresponding unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
  &NewLine;Acrobatics (air or fire) or Athletics (earth or water) modifier of +20; ignore this change if your own modifier is higher.

  You also gain specific abilities based on the type of elemental you choose:

  &NewLine;**Air**
  &NewLine;Fly Speed 80 feet, movement doesn't trigger reactions;
  &NewLine;Melee 1 gust, Damage 1d4 bludgeoning.
