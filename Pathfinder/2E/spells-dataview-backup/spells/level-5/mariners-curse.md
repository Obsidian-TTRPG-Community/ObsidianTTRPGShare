description: >
  You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target becomes [[Sickened]] 1. Reducing its Sickened condition to 0 ends the curse.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target becomes [[Sickened]] 1 and can't reduce its Sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by remove curse or similar magic. Whenever the target is Sickened and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also [[Slowed]] 1.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes [[Sickened]] 2.
