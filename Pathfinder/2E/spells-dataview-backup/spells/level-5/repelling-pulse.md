description: >
  You unleash a powerful pulse of telekinetic power, and the pulse violently hurls creatures away from you. Each creature in the area takes 7d10 force damage depending on its Reflex save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The creature takes half damage.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. The creature is pushed 20 feet away from you and is then knocked [[Prone]].

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The force damage increases by 2d10, and the distance the target is moved on a failure and critical failure increases by 5 feet.
