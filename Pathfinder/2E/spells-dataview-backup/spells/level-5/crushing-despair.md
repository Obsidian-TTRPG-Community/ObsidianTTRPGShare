description: >
  You inflict despair on creatures in the area. The effects for each creature are determined by its Will save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** For 1 round, the creature can't use reactions and must attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it is [[Slowed]] 1 for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.
  &NewLine;**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is automatically [[Slowed]] 1 for 1 minute.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (7th)** The area increases to a 60-foot cone.
