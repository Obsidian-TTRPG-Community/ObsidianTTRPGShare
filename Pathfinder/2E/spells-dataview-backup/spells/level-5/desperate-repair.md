description: >
  You hold a shield together with the power of your magic, forcing wood and steel to fuse back together. The shield remains at 1 Hit Point and isn't destroyed. Its construction is weakened until someone takes the time to repair it, preventing desperate repair or a similar ability from saving the same shield until your next daily preparations.
