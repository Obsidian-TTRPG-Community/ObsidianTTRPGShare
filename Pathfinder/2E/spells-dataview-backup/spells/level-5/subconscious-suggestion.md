description: >
  You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target's mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs. You suggest a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
