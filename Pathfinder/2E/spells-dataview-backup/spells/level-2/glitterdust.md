description: >
  Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust. Each creature must attempt a Reflex save. If a creature has its invisibility negated by this spell, it is [[Concealed]] instead of [[Invisible]]. This applies both if the creature was already Invisible and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from this spell.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target's invisibility is negated for 2 rounds.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is [[Dazzled]] for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and Dazzled for 10 minutes. Its invisibility is negated for 10 minutes.
