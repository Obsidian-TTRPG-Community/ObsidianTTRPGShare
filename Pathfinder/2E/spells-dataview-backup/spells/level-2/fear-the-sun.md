description: >
  You cause the creature's vision to become particularly sensitive. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The creature is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature is dazzled for 1 minute.
