  A brilliant and clamorous display of sparks and colorful fireworks explode around your enemies, dealing 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 sonic damage to creatures within a 10-foot burst. All creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The creature takes half damage and is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is dazzled for 3 rounds.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, takes 1d4 persistent fire damage, and is dazzled for 1 minute.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The initial fire damage increases by 1d8, the sonic damage increases by 1d8, and the persistent fire damage a creature takes on a critical failure increases by 1d4.
