description: >
  You adjust your magnetic polarity, causing metal objects to jump and shudder away from you. Attacks made with metal objects against you take a -1 status penalty, and the squares adjacent to you are difficult terrain for creatures wearing metal armor. For creatures made entirely of metal, the penalty to their attack rolls is -2 and the squares adjacent to you are greater difficult terrain.
  While this spell is active, you require an additional Interact action before using a metal object (including to Strike with a metal weapon), and if you're wearing metal armor, you're [[Slowed]] 1.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+3)** The status penalty to attack rolls increases by 1.
