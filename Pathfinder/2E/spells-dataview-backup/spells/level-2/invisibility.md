description: >
  Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes [[Invisible]]. This makes it [[Undetected]] to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [[Hidden]] to them instead. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (4th)** The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a hostile action.
