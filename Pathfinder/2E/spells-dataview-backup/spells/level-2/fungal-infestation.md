description: >
  Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal 2d6 persistent Poison damage, and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target takes half the persistent poison damage.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
