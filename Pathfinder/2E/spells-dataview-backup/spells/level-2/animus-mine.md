description: >
  You implant a mental mine within your psyche that detonates against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. You can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to suppress the effects of the mine for 1 round to allow someone to safely use a mental effect on you. You can Dismiss the spell.
  The first creature that uses a mental effect against you triggers the animus mine, causing the spell to end. The animus mine deals 4d8 mental damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a Will save. This spell should only the deal the mental damage on magical mental effects that send their magic into your mind, not if a creature tries to do something mundane like talk to you.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The creature takes half damage.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Stunned]] 1.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[Stunned]] 1. You are unaffected by the triggering mental effect.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8.
