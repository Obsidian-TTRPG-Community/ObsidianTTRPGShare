description: >
  A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth-words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe. Your words deal 2d6 persistent fire damage, and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target takes half the persistent fire damage.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target becomes [[Frightened]] 1 and takes the full persistent fire damage.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target becomes [[Frightened]] 2 and takes double the persistent fire damage.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** You can target two additional creatures, and the persistent damage increases by 2d6.
