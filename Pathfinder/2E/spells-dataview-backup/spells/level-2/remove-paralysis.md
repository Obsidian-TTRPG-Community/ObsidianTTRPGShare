description: >
  A surge of energy frees a [[Paralyzed]] creature. You can attempt to counteract a single effect imposing the Paralyzed condition on the target. This does not cure someone who is Paralyzed from some natural state or effect, such as paralysis caused by non-magical wounds or toxins.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (6th)** The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
