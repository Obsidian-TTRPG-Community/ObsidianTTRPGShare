description: >
  You attune yourself to an underlying cosmic order to the world. While you remain in tune with this power, you gain a +1 status bonus to Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you critically fail any check while under the effects of this spell, the bonus ends and you instead have a -1 status penalty to all checks for the remaining duration.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (5th)** The status bonus increases to +2.
  &NewLine;**Heightened (8th)** The status bonus increases to +3.

  Note: The automation for the critical failure effect defaults to 10 rounds and must be altered manually.
