description: >
  A ray that saps a foe's strength flashes from your hand. Attempt a ranged spell attack against the target. If you succeed, that creature attempts a Fortitude save to determine the spell's effect. If your attack roll is a critical success, use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of its save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target becomes [[Enfeebled]] 1.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target becomes [[Enfeebled]] 2.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target becomes [[Enfeebled]] 3.
