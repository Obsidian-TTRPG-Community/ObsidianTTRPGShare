description: >
  You fill the minds of your enemies with doubt.
  Enemies in the area must succeed at a Will save or take a -1 status penalty to attack rolls as long as they are in the area.
  Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast bane, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet and force enemies in the area that weren't yet affected to attempt another saving throw.
  Bane can counteract [[Bless]].
