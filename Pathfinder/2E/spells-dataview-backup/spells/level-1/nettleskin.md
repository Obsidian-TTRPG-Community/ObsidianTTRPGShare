description: >
  Thorns sprout from your body; they pass through and don't damage any clothing or armor you wear.
  Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee or unarmed attack take 1d4 piercing damage as the nettles jab them and break off. Each time a creature takes damage in this way, nettleskin's duration decreases by 1 round.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
