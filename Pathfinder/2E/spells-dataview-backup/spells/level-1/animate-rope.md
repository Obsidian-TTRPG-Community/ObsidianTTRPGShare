description: >
  You cause a length or section of Rope or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands. You can give it two commands when you Cast the Spell, and one command each time you Sustain the Spell.

  &NewLine;**Bind (attack)** The Rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (-20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target Escapes against your spell DC or breaks the Rope. (A standard adventuring Rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)
  &NewLine;**Coil** The Rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.
  &NewLine;**Crawl** The Rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The Rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.
  &NewLine;**Knot** The Rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.
  &NewLine;**Loop** The Rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.
  &NewLine;**Tie** The Rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.
  &NewLine;**Undo** The Rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The range increases by 50 feet, and you can animate 50 more feet of Rope.
