description: >
  Your magic dredges up a corpse or skeleton and fills it with necromantic life, and you force the dead to fight at your command. You summon a common creature that has the undead trait and whose level is -1; this creature gains the summoned trait. Heightening the spell increases the maximum level of creature you can summon.
