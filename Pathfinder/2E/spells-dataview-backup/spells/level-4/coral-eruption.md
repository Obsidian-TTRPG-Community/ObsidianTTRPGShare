description: >
  Razor sharp coral growths erupt from the ground, transforming the landscape into a dangerous coral reef. You can create a third nonoverlapping burst if the centers of all three bursts are underwater. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 6d6 piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes 1d6 persistent Bleed damage. The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain. A creature that moves through the area takes 3 piercing damage for every square of that area it moves into.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The initial piercing damage increases by 3d6, and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1 piercing.
