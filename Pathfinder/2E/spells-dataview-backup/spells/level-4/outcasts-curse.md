description: >
  You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence abrasive and off-putting. The target must attempt a Will save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check, and creatures they encounter have an initial attitude toward them of one step worse (for instance, [[Unfriendly]] instead of [[Indifferent]]).
  &NewLine;**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, and creatures that the target encounters have an initial attitude toward them of two steps worse.
