description: >
  Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome trait take a -2 circumstance penalty to this save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is [[Enfeebled]] 2 for 1 round.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is [[Enfeebled]] 2 for 1 minute and [[Drained]] 1. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is permanently [[Enfeebled]] 2 and [[Drained]] 2 (although magic such as [[Restoration]] can reduce or remove these conditions).
