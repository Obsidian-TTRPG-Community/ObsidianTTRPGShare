  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** For 1 minute, the first time each round that the target takes at least 10 piercing or slashing damage from a single Strike, it takes 2d6 additional damage of the same type.
  &NewLine;**Failure** As success, but when it takes the additional damage, it also takes 2d6 persistent Bleed damage.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The additional damage increases by 1d6 and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1d6.
