description: >
  You fire a beam of blinding light from your outstretched hands. The beam deals 5d10 good damage. On a failed saving throw, a creature becomes [[Dazzled]] for 1 round, or dazzled for 4 rounds on a critical failure.
  If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, radiant beam attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the target.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.
