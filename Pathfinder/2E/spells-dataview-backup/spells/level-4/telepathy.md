description: >
  You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate only with creatures that share a language with you.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (6th)** Telepathy loses the linguistic trait. You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language.
