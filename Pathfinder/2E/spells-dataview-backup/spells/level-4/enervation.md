description: >
  Extending a finger, you fire a beam of negative energy that weakens the life force of any creature it touches. Each living creature in the line must attempt a Fortitude save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The creature takes 2d8 persistent negative damage.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature takes 4d8 persistent negative damage and becomes [[Drained]] 1.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature takes 4d8 persistent negative damage and becomes [[Drained]] 2 and [[Doomed]] 1.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+2)** The persistent negative damage increases by 1d8 persistent negative damage on a success, or by 2d8 persistent negative damage on a failure or critical failure.
