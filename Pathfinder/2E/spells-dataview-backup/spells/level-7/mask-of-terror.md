description: >
  The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage. When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.

  &NewLine;**Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The creature becomes [[Frightened]] 2 before using its action.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Frightened]] 2, and its action fails and is wasted.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask of terror.
