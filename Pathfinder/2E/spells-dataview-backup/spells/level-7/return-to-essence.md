description: >
  You unravel the magic of a spell that affects a container, door, or lock, converting it into energy you can repurpose to power your own spells.
  Attempt a counteract check against the target spell or magical effect that wards or seals a doorway or chest, such as [[Lock]], or against a spell or effect that deals damage or delivers secondary effects when it's opened, such as [[Glyph of Warding]]. If you succeed, you recover its energy, restoring one of your expended spell slots of 3rd level or lower.
