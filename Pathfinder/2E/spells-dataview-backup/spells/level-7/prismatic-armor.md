description: >
  You wrap the target in armor made of multicolored light. It functions as [[Chromatic Armor]] that is all colors (granting resistance 5 to acid, electricity, fire, force, mental, poison, and sonic). An attacker that critically fails on its saving throw against the spell is [[Blinded]] rather than [[Dazzled]].

  &NewLine;**Heightened (9th)** The resistances increase to 10 each.
