description: >
  You shoot a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra 5d6 good damage.
  If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, searing light attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target takes double fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target takes full damage

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6.
