description: >
  You unleash a holy beam of freezing moonlight. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 cold damage; if the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra 5d6 good damage.
  Moonlight ray's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target takes double cold damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target takes full damage.
  If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, moonlight ray attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6 good{2d6 good damage}.
