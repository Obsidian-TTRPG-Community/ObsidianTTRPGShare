description: >
  With a wave of your hand and a short invocation, you cause feelings of ennui and impending doom to well up in the mind of the targeted creature, who must attempt a Will save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is momentarily overwhelmed with ennui. It becomes [[Slowed]] 1 as it grapples mentally with the pointlessness of existence, but at the end of the target's next turn, the spell effect ends.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and [[Frightened]] 1 from the sense of ennui, and remains slowed and can't reduce the frightened condition below 1 as long as the spell is sustained. At the start of the target's turn, choose one creature within 30 feet of the target to attempt a Will save as well; on a failure, that creature is slowed 1 for 1 round; either way, they are then temporarily immune to this casting of infectious ennui. (Ennui does not continue to spread from this secondary target.)
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As failure, but the primary target is [[Slowed]] 2 and [[Frightened]] 2.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (5th)** When a secondary target becomes slowed, it remains slowed as long as the spell is sustained.
