description: >
  You invoke all things that seep and ooze, your body dissolving into a thick slurry and then reconstituting itself into a Medium ooze battle form. When you first cast this spell, choose black pudding, gelatinous cube, gray ooze, or ochre jelly. While in this form, you gain the ooze trait. You can Dismiss the spell. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

  &NewLine;AC = 7 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
  &NewLine;20 temporary Hit Points.
  &NewLine;You are immune to critical hits, precision damage, and visual effects.
  &NewLine;Resistance 5 to acid, piercing, and slashing damage.
  &NewLine;No vision and motion sense 30 feet. You can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement as a precise sense.
  &NewLine;One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +14, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
  &NewLine;Athletics modifier of +14, unless your own is higher.

  You also gain specific abilities based on the ooze:

  &NewLine;**Black Pudding** Speed 15 feet, climb 15 feet;

  &NewLine;Melee 1 pseudopod, Damage 2d6+5 bludgeoning and 1d8 acid.

  &NewLine;**Gelatinous Cube** Speed 15 feet;

  &NewLine;Melee 1 cube face, Damage 1d6+5 acid; a creature hit by your cube face Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or be [[Stunned]] 1 (or [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round on a critical failure); this save has the incapacitation trait.

  &NewLine;**Gray Ooze** Speed 15 feet, climb 15 feet, swim 15 feet;

  &NewLine;Melee 1 pseudopod, Damage 1d6+5 bludgeoning and 1d6 acid, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.

  &NewLine;**Ochre Jelly** Speed 15 feet, climb 10 feet; resistance 5 to electricity;

  &NewLine;Melee 1 pseudopod, Damage 1d8+5 bludgeoning and 1d8 acid, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.

You instead gain 30 temporary HP; resistance 7 to acid, piercing, and slashing; attack modifier +16; damage bonus +9; and Athletics +16. Your motion sense has a range of 40 feet.
