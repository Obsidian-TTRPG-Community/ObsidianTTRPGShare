description: >
  You fast-forward time for a single creature, burdening it with the aches and pain of an entire day and making it temporarily tired and weak. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is [[Fatigued]] and [[Enfeebled]] 1 for 1 round.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is fatigued and enfeebled 1 for the duration.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target is fatigued and [[Enfeebled]] 2 for the duration. The fatigued condition doesn't end when the spell's duration does (but can still be removed with a night's rest or by similar means).

  &NewLine;**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
