description: >
  Through the strength of your faith, your body becomes infused with holy energy. You have weakness 5 to evil. Any creature that touches or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon takes 1d6 good damage. Your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1 good damage. Your healing spells that restore Hit Points restore an additional 1d4 Hit Points when you initially cast them; as normal, if your healing spell restores Hit Points more than once, grants fast healing, or the like, the additional Hit Points still only apply once.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+3)** Creatures touching you take 1d6 additional good damage, your unarmed Strikes deal 1 additional good damage, your healing spells restore 1d4 more additional Hit Points, and your weakness to evil increases by 5.
