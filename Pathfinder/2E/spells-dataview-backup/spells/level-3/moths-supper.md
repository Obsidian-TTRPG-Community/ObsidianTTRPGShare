description: >
  You sigh, and your breath transforms into delicate, black‑winged butterflies and huge death's-head hawkmoths. They flutter about you briefly, and then range forth in search of sustenance- fresh-spilled blood, by preference, but rotting corpses, flowering plants, or even left-behind food will do in a pinch. They then return, perching on your hair or shoulders and whispering their secrets into your ears. This has three effects.

  You heal 2d4 Hit Points every 10 minutes.
  The first time during the duration when someone successfully Treats your Wounds, you regain an additional 4d4 Hit Points.
  You gain an imprecise sense out to 30 feet that senses only freshly spilled blood and rotten flesh.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The amount of Hit Points healed every 10 minutes increases by 1d4 and the amount of Hit Points regained from the first Treat Wounds increases by 2d4{2d4}.
