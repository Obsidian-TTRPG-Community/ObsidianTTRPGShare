description: >
  You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air in a geometric cloud. Creatures are [[Dazzled]] while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, when it enters the pattern, when it ends its turn within the pattern, or if it uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently [[Fascinated]] by the pattern doesn't attempt new saves.

  &NewLine;**Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is Fascinated by the pattern.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target is Fascinated by the pattern. While it remains Fascinated, it can't use reactions.
