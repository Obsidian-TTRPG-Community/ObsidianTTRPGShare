description: >
  You cause the surface to heave. The area becomes difficult terrain and any tracks in the area are destroyed by the churning ground. Creatures standing in the area take a -1 status penalty to Acrobatics checks to Balance and Tumble Through and Athletics checks to High Jump and Long Jump. The first time each round you Sustain the Spell, you can move the churning area up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures immobilized by the spell are carried along with the shifting sand in the same direction, if possible; this movement is forced movement. Creatures that enter or begin their turn standing in the shifting sand must attempt a Reflex save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and ignores the area's difficult terrain and penalty to skill checks until the end of its turn.
