Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points.

The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.

**Heightened (+1)** The additional healing increases by 2 HP.
