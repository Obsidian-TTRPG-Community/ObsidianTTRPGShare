With a flick of your wrist, you fling a chunk of your elemental matter at your foe. Make a spell attack roll, dealing `dice: 1d8|avg` bludgeoning damage (or fire damage if your element is fire) on a success, and double damage on a critical success. This spell has your element's trait.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
