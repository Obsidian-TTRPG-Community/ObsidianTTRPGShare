You surround a foe in a swirling storm of violent winds, roiling clouds, and crackling lightning. The storm deals `dice: 1d12|avg` electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the target also is [Clumsy](../../../Conditions/Clumsy.md) 2 for 1 round and takes 1 persistent electricity damage.
