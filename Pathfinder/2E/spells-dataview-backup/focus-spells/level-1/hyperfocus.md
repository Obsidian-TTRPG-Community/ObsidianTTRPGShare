---
You sharpen a creature’s senses, though more distant objects become hazy, indistinct, or muted to it. The target gains a +1 status bonus to Perception checks attempted with any of its precise senses. Furthermore, any imprecise senses the target has are sharpened to precise senses (though they do not receive the status bonus).

However, the target cannot perceive anything beyond a range of 20 feet with any of its senses. The duration is determined by the target’s Will save. You can allow allies to choose the outcome instead of rolling a saving throw.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is affected for 1 round.
**Failure** The target is affected for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target cannot perceive anything beyond a range of 10 feet.
