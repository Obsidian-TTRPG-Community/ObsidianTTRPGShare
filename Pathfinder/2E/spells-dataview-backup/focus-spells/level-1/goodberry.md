**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 ripe berry
**Duration** 10 minutes

---
You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an Interact action to regain `dice: 1d6+4|avg` Hit Points.

A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** You can target an additional berry. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single Interact action.
