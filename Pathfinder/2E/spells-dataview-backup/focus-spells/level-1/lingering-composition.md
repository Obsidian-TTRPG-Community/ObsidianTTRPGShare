You add a flourish to your composition to extend its benefits. If your next action is to cast a cantrip composition with a duration of 1 round, attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of a level equal to the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.

**Critical Success** The composition lasts 4 rounds.
**Success** The composition lasts 3 rounds.
**Failure** The composition lasts 1 round, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
