**Mystery** life
**Cast** â–º somatic
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature other than you
**Duration** 1 minute

---
You forge a connection of life energy between you and your target, distributing harm between both of you. When you first Cast the Spell, the target recovers `dice: 1d4|avg` Hit Points. The first time each round that the target takes damage, reduce the damage it takes by 3 (to a minimum of 0 damage). You lose 3 Hit Points each time, or the total damage dealt, if less than 3; this damage ignores any immunities or resistances you have and can't otherwise be mitigated in any way.

The spell ends immediately if you fall [Unconscious](../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md). You can Dismiss the spell.
