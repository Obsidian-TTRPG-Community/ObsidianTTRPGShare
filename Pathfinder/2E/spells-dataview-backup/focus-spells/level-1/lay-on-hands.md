**Cast** ► somatic
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature

---
Your hands become infused with positive energy, healing a living creature or damaging an undead creature with a touch. If you use lay on hands on a willing living target, you restore 6 Hit Points; if the target is one of your allies, they also gain a +2 status bonus to AC for 1 round.

Against an undead target, you deal `dice: 1d6|avg` damage and it must attempt a basic Fortitude save; if it fails, it also takes a –2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing increases by 6, and the damage to an undead target increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
