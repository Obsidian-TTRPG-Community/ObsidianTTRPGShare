---
You instill within a creature the touch of the grave. For the duration, harm and heal spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, harm spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target.

If the target wishes to avoid the spell, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the effects.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target heals half as much from heal and takes half as much damage from harm for 1 round.
**Failure** Effects as described in the text.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The status bonus to the Hit Points restored increases by 2.
