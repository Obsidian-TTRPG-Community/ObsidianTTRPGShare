**Cast** ► somatic
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** Fortitude

---
Your touch calls forth a churning mass of icy water that clings to your target, dealing `dice: 1d4|avg` bludgeoning damage and `dice: 1d4|avg` cold damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage and a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.
**Failure** The target takes full damage and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning and cold damage each increase by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
