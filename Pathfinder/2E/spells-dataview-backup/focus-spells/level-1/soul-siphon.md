You siphon off a portion of the target's soul to bolster your own vitality. The target must attempt a Fortitude save or take `dice: 1d4|avg` negative damage. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the total amount of HP the target loses, including the HP lost from becoming [Drained](../../../Conditions/Drained.md).

**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes drained 1.
