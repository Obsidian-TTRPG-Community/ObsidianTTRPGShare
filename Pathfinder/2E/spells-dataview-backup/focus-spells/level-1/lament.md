You let out your negative emotions in a guttural wail that shakes your enemies’ hearts and deals `dice: 1d8|avg` mental damage (basic Will save). If you have any harmful conditions imposed by emotion effects, lament deals additional mental damage equal to the [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) level of the highest-level effect.
