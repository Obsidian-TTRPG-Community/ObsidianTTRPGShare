**Cast** â–º verbal; **Requirements** You're wielding a staff.

---
You spin your staff with a twirling flourish, attacking two foes and transforming the momentum into magical energy to charge for your next Spellstrike.

Make a melee Strike with your staff against one foe and then a second melee Strike with your staff against a different foe. Your multiple attack penalty applies to both of these attacks as normal.
