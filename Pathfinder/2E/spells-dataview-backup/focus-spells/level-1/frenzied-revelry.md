You recall memories of hedonistic rites to send yourself into an infectious frenzy, dancing and howling wildly to encourage your companions to join in. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against mental effects while in the area. 

Whenever someone benefiting from this bonus critically succeeds at a saving throw against an enemy's mental effect, its revelry increases, granting it a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round.
