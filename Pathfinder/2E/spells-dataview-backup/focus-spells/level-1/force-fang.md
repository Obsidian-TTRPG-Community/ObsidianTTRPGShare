You briefly turn your attack into pure force to bypass your opponent's defenses. Choose a target within your reach, or within the reach of a melee weapon you're wielding. If you can use [Spellstrike](Spellstrike) with a ranged weapon (with the starlit span hybrid study, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon.

For an instant, you transform your weapon or [Unarmed](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/traits/unarmed.md) attack into a spike of pure force, replacing all its normal statistics and abilities. The force fang automatically deals `dice: 1d4+1|avg` force damage to the target.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d4+1|avg`.
