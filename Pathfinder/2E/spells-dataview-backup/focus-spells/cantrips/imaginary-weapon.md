You create a simple weapon of force. Make a melee spell attack roll against your target's AC. If you hit, you deal your choice of bludgeoning or slashing damage equal to `dice: 1d8|avg` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage and can choose to detonate your weapon to [push](../../../Rules/Forced%20Movement.md) the target 10 feet away from you.
