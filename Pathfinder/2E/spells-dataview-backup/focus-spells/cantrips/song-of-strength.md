You bolster your allies' physical strength with a hearty exhortation. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to Athletics checks and to their DCs against Athletics skill actions such as Disarm, Shove, and Trip.

**Special** If you have the [Inspire Heroics](../Level%204/Inspire%20Heroics.md) composition spell, you can use that composition to improve the bonus granted by song of strength in the same way as [Inspire Courage](Inspire%20Courage.md) or [Inspire Defense](Inspire%20Defense.md).
