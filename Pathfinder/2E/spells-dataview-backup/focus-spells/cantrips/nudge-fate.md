**Patron Theme** fate
**Cast** â–º verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

---
You read slightly into the future and give fate a tiny push to achieve the result you desire. Once during the duration, when the target fails an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw and a +1 status bonus would turn a critical failure into a failure, or failure into a success, you grant the target a +1 status bonus to the check retroactively, changing the outcome appropriately. The spell then ends, and the target is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

If you cast nudge fate while a previous casting of this hex is still in effect, the previous effect ends.
