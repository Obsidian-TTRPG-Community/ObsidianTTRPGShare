You offer to broker a pact of peace. If the target accepts and doesn't take [Hostile Actions](../../../Rules/Hostile%20Actions.md) against you and your allies, you take a –1 status penalty to Deception checks to [lie](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/lie.md) to them. If they refuse and take a hostile action against you or an ally, they must attempt a Will save. If they accepted the offer and then take a hostile action against you or an ally, they must attempt a Will save and treat the result as one category worse. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The target takes a –1 status penalty to attack and damage rolls against you and your allies.
**Critical Failure** The target takes a –2 status penalty to attack and damage rolls against you and your allies.
