Nothing is so contagious as a thought. You place either a pleasant thought or a terrifying one in a creature's mind. You can then plant the same thought in a second creature's mind. You can't choose a creature that's already been a target of this casting of contagious idea, nor can you choose yourself. The second target can be beyond the range of the spell, but it must be within 30 feet of the first target.
- **Pleasant Thought** The target is soothed, gaining 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute.
- **Terrifying Thought** The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Success** The target is [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 1 and is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Failure** The target becomes frightened 2.
**Critical Failure** The target becomes frightened 3.

**Heightened (+1)** The temporary Hit Points for a pleasant thought increase by 1.

---
**Amp** You can choose to spread the thought from the second target to a third target, in the same manner as spreading it from the first target to the second. A pleasant thought grants twice as many temporary Hit Points (10, plus an additional 2 for each level heightened).
