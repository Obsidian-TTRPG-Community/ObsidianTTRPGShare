**Cast** â–º verbal
**Range** 60 feet; **Targets** 1 ally and 1 enemy
**Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

---
You see just a split second into the future and glean how an enemy will move, making it easier for your allies to strike it mid-action. Make a Perception check against the target enemy's Will DC or Deception DC, whichever is higher. The GM may judge a different DC is more appropriate if it's higher; for instance, using the Warfare Lore DC of a military captain. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The target ally gains a reaction that lets it make a melee Strike against the target enemy, triggered if the enemy leaves a square within the ally's reach. If the ally already has an ability that lets it make melee Strikes as a reaction, such as [Attack of Opportunity](../../../Rules/Actions/Attack%20of%20Opportunity.md), the ally can forgo gaining the temporary reaction to instead gain a +2 status bonus to melee Strikes it makes as reactions.

**Success** As critical success, but the status bonus an ally gets if it forgoes the reaction is +1.
**Failure** The spell has no effect.

---
**Amp** The spell has the same result on a failure as on a success (but still no effect on a critical failure). Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can choose an additional ally to target, granting them the same benefit as the initial target ally
