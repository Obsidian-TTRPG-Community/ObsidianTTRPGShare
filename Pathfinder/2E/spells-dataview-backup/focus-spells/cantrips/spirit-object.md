**Note** Per design team clarification, an item animated by the spirit object hex uses the spellcaster’s spell DC as its AC. Its Hardness and Hit Points remain unchanged from their normal values as listed on page 577 of the Core Rulebook.
**Patron Theme** baba yaga
**Cast** ► or ►► somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 unattended object up to 1 Bulk

---
Using a sliver of Baba Yaga's power, you briefly bring an object to life. The object gains a means of locomotion, such as sprouting chicken legs, and Strides up to 25 feet to a space you decide within range. If you spent 2 actions Casting the Spell, the object then attacks one creature of your choice adjacent to its new space. Make a melee spell attack roll against the creature.

On a success, the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (as appropriate for the object) equal to `dice: 1d4|avg` plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and on a critical success, it takes double damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the maximum Bulk of the target by 1 and the damage by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
