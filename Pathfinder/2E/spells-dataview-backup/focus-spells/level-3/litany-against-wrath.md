**Cast** â–º verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 evil creature
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** 1 round

---
Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking good creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a wrath demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The first time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.
**Failure** Each time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.
**Critical Failure** The target is [Enfeebled](../../../Conditions/Enfeebled.md) 2. Each time it uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes `dice: 3d6|avg` good damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
