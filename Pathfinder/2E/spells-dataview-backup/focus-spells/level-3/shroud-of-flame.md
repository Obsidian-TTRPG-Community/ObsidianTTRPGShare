You encircle yourself in an aura of protective flames. Each creature that hits you with an unarmed attack, Grapples you, or otherwise touches you takes 3 fire damage. When you Cast the Spell and the first time you sustain it each round, each creature in the area takes `dice: 3d6|avg` fire damage (basic Reflex save).
