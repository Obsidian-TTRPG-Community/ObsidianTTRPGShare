---
You summon an isolated blizzard of obscuring, scouring ice to follow your target. The target attempts a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes `dice: 1d6|avg` cold damage, and the spell ends.
**Failure** The target takes `dice: 1d6|avg` cold damage and `dice: 1d6|avg` persistent cold damage. (The [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md) automatically ends when the spell ends.) It is [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) to other creatures, and other creatures are concealed to it.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but both the cold damage and the persistent cold damage increase to `dice: 2d6|avg`.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage and persistent cold damage increase by 1 (2 on a critical failure).
