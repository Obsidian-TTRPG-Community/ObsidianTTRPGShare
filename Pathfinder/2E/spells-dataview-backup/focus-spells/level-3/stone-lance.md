You conjure a jagged lance of stone and then launch it at a foe. Make a spell attack roll against the target. On a hit, you deal 6d6 piercing damage and the lance impales the creature, giving it a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds unless it [Escapes](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/escape.md).

On a critical hit, if the creature is on the ground, the lance also embeds into the ground and immobilizes the creature until it Escapes. A creature that Escapes after being impaled takes 3 persistent bleed damage. When the spell ends, the lance crumbles into dirt, freeing the target if it hasn't Escaped.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by `dice: 2d6|avg` and the persistent bleed damage for Escapes by 1.
