**Cast** â–º verbal
**Area** 15-foot cone
**Saving Throw** Fortitude

---
You unleash a mighty wave from your hand that buffets back your foes. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If a creature [pushed](../../../Rules/Forced%20Movement.md) by unbreaking wave advance would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes `dice: 3d6|avg` damage.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet.
**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage for pushing a creature into a solid barrier increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
