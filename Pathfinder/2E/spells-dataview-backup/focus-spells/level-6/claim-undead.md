---
You attempt to wrest control of a target undead or force it to recognize you as its master. If the target is [Controlled](../../../Conditions/Controlled.md) by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1 as it fights off your commands.

**Failure** The target becomes [Controlled](../../../Conditions/Controlled.md) by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature.
