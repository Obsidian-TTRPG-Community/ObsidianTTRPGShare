**Mystery** lore
**Cast** ►► material, somatic
**Range** 60 feet; **Targets** up to 6 creatures
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** until the start of your next turn

---
You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due to [Recall Knowledge](../../../Rules/Actions/Recall%20Knowledge.md) or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes 1 damage of the type of weakness you chose (thus triggering the creature's weakness), or loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you chose a resistance.
**Failure** As success, and the creature becomes [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 1 from the revelation of its dread secret.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature is frightened 3.
