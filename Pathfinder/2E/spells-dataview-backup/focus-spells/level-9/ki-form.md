Drawing from deep wells of spiritual power, you take on a special ki form. In your ki form, your hair, feathers, skin, or scales change color and begin to glow. In this form you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed. Choose force, lawful (only if you are lawful), negative, or positive damage. All your Strikes deal `dice: 1d6|avg` additional damage of the chosen type. Your entire body is also surrounded by a glowing corona of the same color as your inner ki; this is a light effect.

Your corona is a 5-foot emanation that deals 2d6 damage of the chosen type to creatures who start their turn within the emanation. If the emanation overlaps with a [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) effect, the corona's glow attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) the [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) effect. Regardless of the outcome, the corona can't attempt to counteract that effect again for 1 day. As a single action, which has the [Concentrate](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, you can flare your corona out to become a 30-foot emanation.

In your ki form, your emotions surge to the forefront and it's difficult to moderate your attacks. Your weapons and unarmed attacks lose the [Nonlethal](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait. You take a –2 status penalty to saves against [Emotion](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/traits/emotion.md) effects but gain a +2 status bonus to saves against all other [Mental](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/traits/mental.md) effects.
