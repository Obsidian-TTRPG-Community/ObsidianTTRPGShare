---
You open your mouth wide and inhale sharply; you draw in the bravery, self-confidence, and hope to which the frightened target clings and then strip away the target's false assumption that these fragile emotions can save them from the oblivion of terror.

You deal `dice: 6d4|avg` mental damage to the creature, which must attempt a Will saving throw.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature's frightened condition increases by 1, and it takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature's frightened condition increases by 2, and it takes full damage; you regain Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes.
**Critical Failure** The creature's frightened condition increases by 3 and it takes double damage; you regain Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d4|avg`.
