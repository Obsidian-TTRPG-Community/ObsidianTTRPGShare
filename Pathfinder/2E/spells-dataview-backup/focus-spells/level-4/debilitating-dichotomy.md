**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature other than you
**Saving Throw** Will

---
You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon with another's conflicts as well. You and the target each take `dice: 9d6|avg` mental damage with a basic Will save, and the target is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1 if it critically fails its save. You get a degree of success one better than you rolled for your saving throw.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 3d6|avg`.
