Divine insight lets you see things as they truly are. The GM attempts a secret [counteracting](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) check against each illusion that is at least partially within the area. Instead of counteracting the illusion, you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against an [Illusory Disguise](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%201/Illusory%20Disguise.md) spell, you see the creature's true form but illusory disguise doesn't end).

The area moves with you for the duration of the spell, and the GM attempts a secret counteract check each time a new illusion is within the area.

**Heightened (7th)** You can allow everyone to see through illusions you succeed against, not just yourself.
