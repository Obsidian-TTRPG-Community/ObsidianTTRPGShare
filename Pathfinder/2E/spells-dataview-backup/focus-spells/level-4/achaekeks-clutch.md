You mark the holy symbol of Achaekek in a visible location on the target's body.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target is marked by Achaekek's symbol. For 1 minute, the first time per round that the target gains persistent bleed damage, they immediately take that amount of slashing damage as the mantis claws grow off the symbol and rake them.
**Failure** As success, but the curse has an unlimited duration.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the DC on the target's flat check to remove persistent bleed damage increases to 20 (15 with particularly effective assistance).
