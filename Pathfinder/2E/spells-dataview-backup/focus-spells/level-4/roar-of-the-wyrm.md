---
You channel the might of dragons into your voice, letting out a roar that engenders respect in dragonkind but that instills fear in most other creatures. The impressive roar grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks for 10 minutes against dragons that were in the area at the time of casting. All enemies within the area other than dragons must attempt a Will save; to these enemies, roar of the wyrm is a [Fear](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%201/Fear.md) effect.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 1.
**Failure** The creature is frightened 2.
**Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 3 and [Fleeing](../../../Conditions/Fleeing.md) for 1 round.

Roar of the wyrm affects non-dragon creatures with deep ties to dragonkind (such as a barbarian with the draconic instinct, a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, or a member of a culture that reveres dragons) as if they had the [Dragon](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/traits/dragon.md) trait. The GM decides if a creature is aligned enough with dragonkind to be affected in this way.
