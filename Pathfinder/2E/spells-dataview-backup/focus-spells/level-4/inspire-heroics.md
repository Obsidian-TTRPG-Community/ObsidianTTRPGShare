You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide to your allies with your inspire courage or [Inspire Defense](../Cantrips/Inspire%20Defense.md) composition. If your next action is to cast inspire courage or inspire defense, attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually a very hard DC of a level equal to that of the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your inspire courage or inspire defense composition depends on the result of your check.

**Critical Success** The status bonus from your inspire courage or inspire defense increases to +3.
**Success** The status bonus from inspire courage or inspire defense increases to +2.
**Failure** Your inspire courage or inspire defense provides only its normal bonus of +1, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
