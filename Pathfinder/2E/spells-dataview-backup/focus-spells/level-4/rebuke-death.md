You snatch creatures from the jaws of death. You can spend 1 to 3 actions Casting this Spell, and you can target a number of creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains `dice: 3d6|avg` Hit Points. If the target had the [Dying](../../../Conditions/Dying.md) condition, coming back from dying due to this healing doesn't increase its [Wounded](../../../Conditions/Wounded.md) condition.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the healing by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
