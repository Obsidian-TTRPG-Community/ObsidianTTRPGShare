You create an [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) eye sensor, as [Clairvoyance](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%204/Clairvoyance.md).

When created, this eye must be in your line of sight. When the spell's duration ends, you can spend 1 Focus Point as a free action to extend the duration for another hour, though as normal, it ends immediately during your next daily preparations.
