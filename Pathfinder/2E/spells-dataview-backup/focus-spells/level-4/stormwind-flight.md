**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Duration** 1 minute

---
Powerful winds carry you smoothly through the air, giving you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as [Feather Fall](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%201/Feather%20Fall.md).

<hr>

**Heightened (6th)** When you fly using stormwind flight, you don't count flying against the wind as difficult terrain.
