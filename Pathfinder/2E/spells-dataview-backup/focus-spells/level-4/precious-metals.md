Your deity blesses base metals to transform them into precious materials. The target item transforms from its normal metal into [Cold Iron](../../../Items/Materials/Cold%20Iron.md), copper, gold, iron, [Silver](../../../Items/Materials/Silver.md), or steel. An item transmuted in this way deals damage according to its new material. For example, a steel sword transmuted to cold iron would deal additional damage to a creature with a weakness to cold iron.

This change is clearly magical and temporary, so the item's monetary value doesn't change; you couldn't transmute copper coins to gold and use those coins to purchase something or as a cost for a spell.

**Heightened (8th)** Add adamantine and mithral to the list of metals you can transform the item into.
