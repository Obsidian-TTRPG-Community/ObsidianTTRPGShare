**Cast** â—„ verbal; **Trigger** You and at least 1 ally are about to roll initiative.
**Range** 10 feet; **Targets** you and the triggering ally

You stoke the righteous anger within yourself and an ally. You and the target ally each roll a d20 and use the higher result for both your initiative rolls.

You each still use your own Perception modifier or other statistic to determine your results.
