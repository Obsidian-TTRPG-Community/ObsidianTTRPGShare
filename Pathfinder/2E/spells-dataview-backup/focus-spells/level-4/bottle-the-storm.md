**Domain** lightning
**Cast** ◄ somatic; **Trigger** You would take electricity damage.
**Duration** 1 minute

---
When lightning is turned at you, you store the charge safely within yourself, unleashing it when the time is right. You gain electricity resistance 10 against the triggering effect. If you successfully prevent damage in this way, at any time during the spell’s duration, you can spend a single action, which has the attack trait, to expend the charge and make a melee spell attack at an adjacent target or a ranged spell attack at a target within 60 feet.

This attack deals electricity damage equal to the damage prevented by bottle the storm. If you cast bottle the storm a second time before the original duration elapses, or if you do not make this attack, the stored charge dissipates harmlessly.
