**Domain** naga
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Area** 30-foot-radius emanation centered on you
**Saving Throw** basic Will

---
You call upon the authority of cosmic forces of order, overwhelming creatures with remorse and agony for acting outside of their station and purpose. Enemies in the area take `dice: 4d6|avg` mental damage and must attempt a Will save. A creature that has lost abilities as a result of performing acts anathema to its deity or beliefs (such as a champion who violated their tenets and hasn't atoned) uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.

At the GM's discretion, a creature currently filling its appointed station and purpose (such as a farmer working in a field or a criminal in the act of committing a crime) uses the outcome one degree of success better than the result of its saving throw.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and must [Drop Prone](../../../Rules/Actions/Drop%20Prone.md) as its first action on its next turn.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, must Drop Prone as its first action on its next turn, and can't Stand during its next turn.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
