You make an attack filled with a medusa's petrifying power. Make an unarmed Strike with the following additional effects.

**Critical Success** The target is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 2 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the [Incapacitation](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/traits/incapacitation.md) trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from medusa's wrath, it is [Petrified](../../../Conditions/Petrified.md) permanently. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.

**Success** As critical success, but the target is initially slowed 1.
