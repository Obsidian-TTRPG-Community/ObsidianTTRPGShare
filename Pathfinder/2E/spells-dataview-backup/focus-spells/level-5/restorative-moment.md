You manipulate the threads of time around the target, giving them some of the benefits of a day's passage. The target decreases the values of any [Doomed](../../../Conditions/Doomed.md) and [Drained](../../../Conditions/Drained.md) conditions it has by 1 and can immediately attempt one saving throw against each affliction it has with a stage length of 1 day or less. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
