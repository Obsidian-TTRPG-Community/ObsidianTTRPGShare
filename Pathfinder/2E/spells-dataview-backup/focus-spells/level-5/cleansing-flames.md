You wrap the target in purifying flames. You can attempt to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) a single poison or non-curse effect imparting the [Clumsy](../../../Conditions/Clumsy.md), [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md), [Enfeebled](../../../Conditions/Enfeebled.md), [Fatigued](../../../Conditions/Fatigued.md), [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md), [Paralyzed](../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md), [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md), or [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) condition.

The target can choose to empower the flames with their life force, becoming [Drained](../../../Conditions/Drained.md) 1 (or increasing their drained value by 1, if already under the condition) to grant you a +1 circumstance bonus to your counteract check.
