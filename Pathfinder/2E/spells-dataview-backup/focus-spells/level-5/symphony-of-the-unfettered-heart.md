Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns. Attempt a Performance check to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) one of the following conditions affecting the target: [Grabbed](../../../Conditions/Grabbed.md), [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md), [Paralyzed](../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md), [Restrained](../../../Conditions/Restrained.md), [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md), or [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md). If you fail, you can't target that effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [escape](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/escape.md) DC for grabbed).

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to four creatures.
