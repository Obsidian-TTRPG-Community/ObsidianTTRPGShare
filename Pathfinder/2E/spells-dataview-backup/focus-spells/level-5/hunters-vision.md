Your target glows with a magical aura visible only to you and those who follow your lead. Your target is visible to you and others sharing your [Hunt Prey](Hunt%20Prey) benefits even if it wouldn't normally be due to lighting or the [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) or [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) conditions, though cover from opaque objects still blocks your sight.

You ignore the flat check against the target due to the concealed condition, and the target isn't automatically [Hidden](../../../Conditions/Hidden.md) from you due to [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) or being invisible.
