---
Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the target's ability to react. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly slothful creature, such as a sloth demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target can't use reactions.
**Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1.
**Critical Failure** The target can't use reactions and is slowed 2.
