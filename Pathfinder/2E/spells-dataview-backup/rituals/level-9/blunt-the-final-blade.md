You anoint the [Final Blade](../../../Items/Artifacts/Final%20Blade.md) with powdered mithral and grave dirt while speaking softly and carefully to the souls trapped within it. You create a mystical pathway for the souls to escape through and urge them to draw out the magic of the final blade with them as they depart.

**Critical Success** As success, and the souls also grant a boon; the primary and secondary casters gain a +2 status bonus to saves against [Death](../../../../../TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/traits/death.md) and [Fear](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%201/Fear.md) effects for the next year.
**Success** The souls escape the final blade and peacefully pass on to their eternal rewards, as appropriate for each soul. The final blade is no longer magical; it can't store anymore souls and can be destroyed as a normal guillotine.
**Failure** The ritual has no effect.
**Critical Failure** The ritual goes horribly wrong. The souls within the final blade are released in a furious rush as a gray death that does its best to slay the ritual's casters and run amok among the living. The final blade retains it abilities and can continue to store souls.
