In some places, it always feels like something is observing you, as if the very land doesn't want you there. Hostile creatures skitter about in the underbrush. Tendrils of mist try to lead you stray. Even the scent of the place is unwelcoming. Sometimes, this eerie atmosphere is a natural occurrence. Other times, it's the result of the dread ambience ritual.

To create this unwelcoming, intimidating aura, you must prepare the area with salts and herbs, traveling the entire edge of the area throughout the casting.

After you complete your ritual, anyone who enters the area receives a status penalty to saving throws against fear effects within the dread ambience.

**Critical Success** The sense of dread is particularly powerful. Every creature in an area takes a –2 status penalty to saving throws against fear effects.
**Success** The dread ambience succeeds. Every creature in the area takes a –1 status penalty to saving throws against fear effects.
**Failure** The dread ambience fails.
**Critical Failure** The dread ambience fails, and the casters take a –1 status penalty to all Will saves for the next week.
