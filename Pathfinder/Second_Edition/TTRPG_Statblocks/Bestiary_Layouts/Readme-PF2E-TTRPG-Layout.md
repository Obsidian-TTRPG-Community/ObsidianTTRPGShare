# Readme for PF2E Bestiary Statblocks

The Obsidian TTRPG Share team presents the Release Candidate 1 for the Pathfinder 2E TTRPG Statblock Layout.

## Features

Wikilink Embed: ![[_attachments/Pathfinder2e-Statblocks-RC1.png]]

Wikilink Relative Embed: ![[_attachments/Pathfinder2e-Statblocks-RC1.png]]

Markdown Embed: `![](_attachments/Pathfinder2e-Statblocks-RC1.png)`

![](_attachments/Pathfinder2e-Statblocks-RC1.png)


1. Fully fleshed and *mostly*\** theme-proof statblock layout. 
2. Initiative tracker integration
3. Most fields accept markdown (But do not use asterisks, use underscores!)
4. Conditional fields
5. Commented CSS File so you can make it your own.

\* ITS Theme users, there may still be *some* formatting issues until the new release. Alternatively, you can switch to using ITS Beta.

### A Special Thanks

> The Developers who took on this task are Sigrunixia/LittleMaelstrom, and Fate. The repository will be its maintainers but Sigrunixia and Fate will continue to take a lead role in updates as they work to transition to making this statblock layout into an official layout included within TTRPG Statblocks.


## What you need to make this statblock shine
1. [[_attachments/Path2eBlock.json]], to install into TTRPG Statblocks
2. [[_attachments/Pathfinder2E-TTRPG-Statblock.css]] into your `.obsidian/snippets` folder. 
2.a. ITS Users will need to use [[_attachments/Pathfinder2E-TTRPG-Statblock-ITS.css]] until ITS 2.0 is out, or until the TTRPG Share indicates otherwise. 

### Optional
3. This [[Template-2ETools-Monster-Handlebar]] file to take .json data from the [PF2E Tools Bestiary](https://pf2etools.com/bestiary.html#aapoph%20serpentfolk_b2) to your vault. Complete with YAML data for Initiative Tracker.

  You will need to use [Obsidian Import Json](https://github.com/farling42/obsidian-import-json) to use this handlebar template.

## Required Plugins
1. [Obsidian TTRPG Statblocks](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-5e-statblocks)
2. [Obsidian Dice Rollers](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller)

### Optional But Nice!
3. [Obsidian Initiative Tracker](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-initiative-tracker)
