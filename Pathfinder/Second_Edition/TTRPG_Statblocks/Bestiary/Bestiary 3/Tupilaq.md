    desc: "  Like normal objects, a tupilaq has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once a tupilaq is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, it loses its Hardness, and its Armor Class is reduced to 22."

    desc: "  When a tupilaq is created, the curse imparted by its creator manifests in the form of a single 3rd-level primal spell the tupilaq can cast three times per day. The particular spell is a reflection of the creator's wish for vengeance. By default, and for a found or summoned tupilaq, this spell is fireball."
