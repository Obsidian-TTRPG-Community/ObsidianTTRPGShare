# Attack of Opportunity [R](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 474*  

**Class** fighter
- **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a [manipulate](/rules/traits/manipulate.md) action or a [move](/rules/traits/move.md) action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity**: Reaction

You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a [manipulate](/rules/traits/manipulate.md) action, you disrupt that action. This [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md).
