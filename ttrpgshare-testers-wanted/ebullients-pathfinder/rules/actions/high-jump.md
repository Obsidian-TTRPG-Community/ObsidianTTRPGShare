# High Jump (basic) [>>](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 242*  

**Skill** [athletics](/compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Two-Action

You Stride, then make a vertical [Leap](/rules/actions/leap.md) and attempt a DC 30 [Athletics](/compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to increase the height of your jump. If you didn't [Stride](/rules/actions/stride.md) at least 10 feet, you automatically fail your check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation, as determined by the GM.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Increase the maximum vertical distance to 8 feet, or increase the maximum vertical distance to 5 feet and maximum horizontal distance to 10 feet.
> - **Success** Increase the maximum vertical distance to 5 feet.
> - **Failure** You [Leap](/rules/actions/leap.md) normally.
> - **Critical Failure** You don't [Leap](/rules/actions/leap.md) at all, and instead you fall [prone](/rules/conditions.md#Prone) in your space.

> [!example] Leap
> 
> The [Leap](/rules/actions/leap.md) basic action is used for [High Jump](/rules/actions/high-jump.md) and [Long Jump](/rules/actions/long-jump.md). [Leap](/rules/actions/leap.md) lets you take a careful, short jump. You can [Leap](/rules/actions/leap.md) up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 30 feet. You land in the space where your [Leap](/rules/actions/leap.md) ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap if your Speed is between 15 feet and 30 feet, or a 10-foot gap if your Speed is 30 feet or more). If you make a vertical [Leap](/rules/actions/leap.md), you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally onto an elevated surface.
