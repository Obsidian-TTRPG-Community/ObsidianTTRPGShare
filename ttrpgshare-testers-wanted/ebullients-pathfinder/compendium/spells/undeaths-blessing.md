You instill within a creature the touch of the grave. For the duration, [harm](/compendium/spells/harm.md) and [heal](/compendium/spells/heal.md) spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, [harm](/compendium/spells/harm.md) spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target.

If the target wishes to avoid the spell, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target heals half as much from [heal](/compendium/spells/heal.md) and takes half as much damage from [harm](/compendium/spells/harm.md) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** Effects as described in the text.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The status bonus to the Hit Points restored increases by 2.
