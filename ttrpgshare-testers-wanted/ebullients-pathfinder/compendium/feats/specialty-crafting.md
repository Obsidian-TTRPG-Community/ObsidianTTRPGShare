# Specialty Crafting  *Feat 1*  
[general](/rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](/rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

Your training focused on [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting) one particular kind of item.

Select one of the specialties; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting) checks to [Craft](/rules/actions/craft.md) items of that type. If you are a master in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting), this bonus increases to +2.

If it's unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides.

Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.
