- **Prerequisites**: [Halfling Weapon Familiarity](/compendium/feats/halfling-weapon-familiarity.md)

You are particularly adept at fighting with your people's favored weapons. Whenever you critically succeed at an attack roll using a [shortsword](/compendium/equipment/items/shortsword.md), a [sling](/compendium/equipment/items/sling.md), or a halfling weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
