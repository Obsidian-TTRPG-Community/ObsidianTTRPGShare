### Description 

*Sand table* allows you to create a scale model of the battlefield surrounding your position, showing numbers of troops, their relative positions, and their movement as if you were observing from a great height overhead (1,000 feet up). You cast the spell upon a table or other flat surface and cause the model to appear upon a 5-foot-by-5-foot section of that table or surface. It reflects accurate terrain and topography, though it doesn’t identify fine topographical features or concealed or hidden topography. It also indicates all normally visible Small or larger creatures within the area of effect, but it doesn’t provide identifying characteristics of those creatures; each creature appears as an indistinct speck, under 1 millimeter in each dimension.  
  
The spell marks obvious war camps and contingents of troops with a symbol of their banner (if they openly carry such a symbol). The spell provides a snapshot of the topography and creature locations when cast; it doesn’t adjust for changes that occur during the duration. The table shows the land surrounding itself up to a 1-mile radius from the surface. The sand table does not reveal invisible or incorporeal creatures, nor does it include creatures that are underground, indoors, submerged below the surface of water, below a tree line or other source of cover from above, or flying above 1,000 feet in the air. Those looking at the table can spot Small and larger creatures that are using Stealth to hide, but they take a -10 penalty on their Perception checks because of the size of the models.  
  
Once the spell has been cast, if anything moves or shakes the surface upon which it was placed, the spell ends instantly.
