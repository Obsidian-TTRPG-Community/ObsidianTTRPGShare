# Sensory Overload 

**source**:: Psychic Anthology pg. 11  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 2, psychic 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: 1 creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You overload the target creatureâ€™s senses, making it difficult for the target to concentrate. For the duration of the effect, the target must succeed at a Will save at the same DC as the original effect to perform any standard or full-round action. On a failure, the creature loses the action that triggered the saving throw. If successful, the creature is able to take the action, but this spell effect is not negated.
