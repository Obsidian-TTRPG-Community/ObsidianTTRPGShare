### Description 

This spell functions like *secret chest*, except it affects a small structure, vault, or oversized chest. Living creatures within a *secret vault* don’t cause the spell to fail. While the vault is stored on the Ethereal Plane, living creatures within the vault don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe, but they can’t leave the vault except via magic such as *plane shift*. The vault used as a focus for *secret vault* must cost at least 25,000 gp, and its replica costs 250 gp. A secret vault has only a 1% cumulative chance per day of becoming irretrievably lost after 360 days.
