### Description 

This spell functions like *gaseous form*, except the target becomes a visible swirl of hot ash and smoke instead of harmless translucent gas. The target gains the fire subtype. Any creature that begins its turn sharing a space with the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or suffer the effects of smoke inhalation.

## Mythic Scorching Ash Form 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 107  
The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This otherwise makes the same changes as *mythic gaseous form*.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of *scorching ash form* as a move action.
