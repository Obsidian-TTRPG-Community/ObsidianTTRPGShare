# Suffocation, Slow 

**source**:: Dark Markets - A Guide to Katapesh pg. 57  
**school**:: necromancy (death)
**level**:: sahirafiyun 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: living creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

The target is unable to breathe and is treated as if she is holding her breath (see the rules for suffocation). Strong stimulants, effects that increase the targetâ€™s Constitution, or physical trauma (such as taking 10 or more points of damage from a single attack) negate the spell immediately. Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to this spell. The target is considered to have taken a dose of pesh for the purpose of addiction and withdrawal effects. Canny sahir use this spell to subtly kill enemies, as the spell mimics a pesh overdose.
