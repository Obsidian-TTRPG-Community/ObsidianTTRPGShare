# Siphon Might 

**source**:: Giant Hunter's Handbook pg. 27  
**school**:: necromancy
**level**:: arcanist 3, druid 3, hunter 3, magus 3, sorcerer 3, summoner 3, summoner (unchained) 3, witch 3, wizard 3

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude half
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You drain the might of the target and transfer that power to another creature. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6 + 1 per 2 caster levels (maximum 1d6 + 5). This effect can’t cause the subject’s Strength score to drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save halves this penalty. This penalty doesn’t stack with itself or the penalty applied from *ray of enfeeblement*.  
  
You can grant any one creature adjacent to you (including yourself) an enhancement bonus to Strength equal to the Strength penalty imposed by this spell.
