### Description 

This spell functions like *shadow transmutation*, except it can mimic *greater polymorph* instead of *polymorph*. The illusory attacks and special abilities of any shape assumed using *greater shadow transmutation* deal three-fifths (60%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60% likely to work against nonbelievers.
