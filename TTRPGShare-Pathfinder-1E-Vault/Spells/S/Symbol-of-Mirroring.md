### Description 

This spell functions as *symbol of death*, except it instead creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates function as *mirror image*, moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creatureâ€™s turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
*Symbol of mirroring* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.
