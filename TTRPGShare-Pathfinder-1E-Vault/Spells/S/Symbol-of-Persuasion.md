This spell functions like *symbol of death*, except that all creatures within the radius of a *symbol of persuasion* instead become charmed by the caster (as the *charm monster* spell) for 1 hour per caster level.  
  
Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of persuasion* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of persuasion* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of persuasion* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a *symbol of persuasion* and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for *symbol of persuasion*.
