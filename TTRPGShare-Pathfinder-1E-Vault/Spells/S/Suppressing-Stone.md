# Suppressing Stone 

**source**:: Inner Sea Races pg. 223  
**school**:: evocation
**level**:: arcanist 4, sorcerer 4, wizard 4 (Azlanti)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (one *ioun stone* worth at least 1,000 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 10 minutes/level or until discharged (D)

### Description 

You infuse arcane power into the focus *ioun stone*, which must be currently floating around your head. If the *ioun stone* ever ceases floating around you, the spell ends immediately, and the spell fails if the *ioun stone* in question is cracked, burned, flawed, or otherwise of lesser value (such as a *dull gray ioun stone*). While the spell is active, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5 at caster level 20). Whenever you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or effect, you can burn out the focus, transforming it irrevocably into a *dull gray ioun stone* and ending this spell, but suppressing the mind-affecting effect for 1 round per 2,500 gp of value of the focus (minimum 1 round). Rounds during which the effect is suppressed still count against its duration, and the effect can still be dispelled or disrupted during this time.
