# Seer's Bane 

**source**:: Pathfinder \#102: Breaking the Bones of Hell pg. 75  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: cleric 6, inquisitor 6, oracle 6, warpriest 6 (Mephistopheles)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature or object touched  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless, object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless, object)

### Description 

This spell functions as *nondetection*, except that those who cast divination spells targeting the warded creature or item must succeed on a caster level check (DC = 15 + your caster level). If the caster of the divination fails, deadly magical feedback strikes at him, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level).  
  
Alternatively, if you cast *bestow curse*, *chaos hammer*, *contagion*, *holy smite*, *order’s wrath*, *poison*, or *unholy blight* in the round immediately following *seer’s bane*, you can replace the spell’s damaging effect with the effects of that second spell (the divination’s caster-and potentially those around him-save as normal for the modifying spell).
