### Description 

This spell functions like *sending*, except the subject also receives knowledge of a command word that, when spoken, summons you to the open space nearest to the subject. The subject must speak the command word within 1 round of knowing it to summon you, although the subject isn’t obligated to speak it. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
