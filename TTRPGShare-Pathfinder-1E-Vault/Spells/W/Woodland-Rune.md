### Description 

Created by Ghorus as a safety measure to limit his enemies’ movements, this spell allows you to inscribe a powerful rune on any surface. Woodland rune triggers when any non-plant creature (apart from the caster) moves within 30 feet of the rune. When it’s triggered, roots and branches sprout from the ground, catching all creatures within a 30-foot burst of the rune and hindering their movement as if they were moving through heavy undergrowth, though it does not provide concealment. Plant creatures and creatures under the effect of woodland stride or freedom of movement are not affected by this spell. In all other respects, this spell functions as symbol of death.
