# Firewalker's Meditation 

**source**:: Divine Anthology pg. 12  
**school**:: abjuration (meditative)
**level**:: arcanist 4, cleric 4, druid 4, paladin 3, shaman 4, warpriest 4, wizard 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 hour  
**components**:: V, M (soothing incense worth 400 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 24 hours or until discharged

### Description 

You focus your mind on blocking out pain, allowing your body to endure punishments that would be otherwise unbearable. While under the effects of this spell, you continue to register pain-you simply don’t suffer the deleterious effects such sensations bring. For example, if you were lit on fire as you slept, you would still wake from the pain of burning even though some of the fire damage you endured (perhaps all of it) would be negated by this spell.  
  
You gain DR 5/magic, resist fire 10, and a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist pain effects. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged. At any time during the spell’s duration when you take damage that would be subject to the damage reduction or energy resistance granted by this spell, you can expend the spell’s remaining duration as an immediate action in order to increase the effects to DR 10/magic, resist fire 30, and immunity to pain effects. If you do so, these enhanced effects persist for 3 rounds. After this time, the spell ends.
