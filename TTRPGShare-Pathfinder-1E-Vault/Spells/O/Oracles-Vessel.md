# Oracle's Vessel 

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 230  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: oracle 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

The target gains all the benefits of your oracle’s curse, with none of the penalties. In some cases, this has no effect (for example, a fighter with your haunted curse can’t cast spells and doesn’t gain any benefit from having additional spells known).
