### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level (D)

### Description 

Whenever you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any type of Large naga (including most nagas, but not royal nagas), though not the form of a specific individual. In effect, you transform into a Large serpent, gaining a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a -2 penalty to your Dexterity, and a +4 natural armor bonus. Unlike with *beast shape II*, however, you keep your own head when using this spell and can cast spells with verbal and somatic components, even though the naga form doesnâ€™t have hands.  
  
If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good maneuverability), swim 60 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, and scent.
