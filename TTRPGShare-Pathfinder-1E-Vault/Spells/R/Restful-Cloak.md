# Restful Cloak 

**source**:: Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 21  
**school**:: conjuration (healing)
**level**:: cleric 2, druid 2, hunter 2, occultist 2, oracle 2, paladin 2, ranger 2, shaman 2, warpriest 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (cloak)

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level

### Description 

A cloak you are wearing transforms into a canvas tent large enough to hold four Medium creatures, firmly pitched in a flat area adjacent to you (if there is no such area, this spell simply fails). A creature regains 1 hit point for each hour it rests in the tent, in addition to any other benefits of resting. Additionally, a fatigued creature resting within the tent for 1 hour loses the fatigued condition, but a creature cannot recover from being fatigued more than once per casting of *restful tent*. At the end of the spell’s duration, the tent transforms back into a cloak. If the tent is moved prior to the expiration of the spell’s duration, the spell immediately ends.
