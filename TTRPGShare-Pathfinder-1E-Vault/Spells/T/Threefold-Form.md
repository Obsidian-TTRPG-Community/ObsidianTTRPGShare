### Description 

You pull forth idealized versions of yourself at various ages from your mind, splitting into three copies of yourself. *Threefold form* functions as *bilocation* (*Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 158*), except there are three of you instead of two, and each of the three bodies is under the effect of *threefold aspect^APG^* with a different idealized age. Other than the differences from *threefold aspect*, each body shares all other effects with you, as normal for *bilocation*.
