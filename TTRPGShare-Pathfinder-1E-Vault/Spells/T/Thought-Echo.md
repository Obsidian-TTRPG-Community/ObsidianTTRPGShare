# Thought Echo 

**source**:: Occult Adventures pg. 189  
**school**:: illusion (glamer)
**level**:: mesmerist 1, psychic 1

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: living creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

When you cast this spell, you establish a mental echo of up to 25 words. Any attempt to read the surface thoughts of the target creature reads only this mental echo unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + your caster level). If you cast *thought echo* on yourself, the DC is instead equal to 15 + your caster level. In addition, when casting this spell upon yourself, you can change the echoed thoughts by taking a standard action and concentrating.  
  
Each time you change the words echoed by the spell in this way, you reduce the spellâ€™s remaining duration by 1 minute. *Thought echo* does not interfere with telepathy or mind reading effects that are capable of reaching thoughts deeper than surface thoughts.
