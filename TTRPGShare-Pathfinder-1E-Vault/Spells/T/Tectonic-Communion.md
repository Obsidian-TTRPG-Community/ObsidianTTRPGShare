### Description 

*Tectonic communion* functions as *commune with nature* with an even greater range. In outdoor or natural underground settings, the spell operates on a radius of 100 miles per caster level, extending even underground without penalty.  
  
For every 2 caster levels above 13th, you may glean an additional fact from the list presented in *commune with nature*. Communities, dungeons, and signs of civilization (such as roads, farms or other constructions and settlements) exist as dark and unknowable blots in your perception of the spell’s area; you’re aware of their location and existence, but can’t discern any information regarding them.
