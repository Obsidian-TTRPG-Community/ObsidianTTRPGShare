### Description 

This spell functions as *create pit*, except that it places a 5-foot-deep pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact with the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may be harmed. Refer to Table 9-2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks (*Core Rulebook* 216). Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition. Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how they became broken) must make a Fortitude saving throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed. The walls of the pit are quite slippery and have a Climb DC of 30.
