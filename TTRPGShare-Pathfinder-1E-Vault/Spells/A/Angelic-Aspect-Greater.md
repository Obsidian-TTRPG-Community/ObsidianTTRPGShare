### Description 

This spell functions like *lesser angelic aspect*, except you gain lowlight vision; darkvision 60 feet; DR 10/evil; immunity to acid, cold, and petrification; resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10; a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison; and protective aura and truespeech as supernatural abilities for the duration of the spell. Also, your wings give you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.  
  
Protective aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures to anyone within 20 feet. Otherwise, it functions as a *magic circle against evil* and a *lesser globe of invulnerability*, both with a radius of 20 feet.  
  
Truespeech allows you to speak with any creature that has a language, as though using the *tongues* spell.
