### Description 

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An *arcane mark* spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a *detect magic* spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.  
  
*See invisibility*, *true seeing*, a *gem of seeing*, or a *robe of eyes* likewise allows the user to see an invisible *arcane mark*. A *read magic* spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an *erase* spell.  
  
If an *arcane mark* is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.  
  
*Arcane mark* must be cast on an object prior to casting *instant summons* on the same object (see that spell description for details).
