In addition, once each round during your turn, you can take a free action to direct your cloak to use the aid another action to assist your skill check, attack roll, or AC. The cloak has an attack bonus or a total skill bonus equal to your caster level plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier (Charisma for bards, Intelligence for wizards, and so on).
