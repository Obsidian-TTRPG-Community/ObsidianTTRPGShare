### Description 

This functions as per *animus mine*, except the triggering creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds instead of staggered. If the target succeeds at a Will saving throw, it takes only half damage and negates the stunned effect. If the target fails this Will saving throw, you automatically succeed at any saving throw against the mind-affecting effect that triggered the mine.
