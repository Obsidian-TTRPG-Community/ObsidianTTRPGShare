### Description 

You constrain the target such that the target automatically misses with all attacks made against creatures that are not of the opposite alignment of it. For example, a lawful evil target would automatically fail at all attacks except those made against chaotic good creatures, and a neutral good target would automatically fail at all attacks except those made against neutral evil creatures. For the purposes of *antithetical constraint*, creatures that are chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good are all considered to have the opposite alignment of a target whose alignment is neutral with no other alignment components. This restriction doesnâ€™t apply to effects that do not require attack rolls, such as *magic missile*.
