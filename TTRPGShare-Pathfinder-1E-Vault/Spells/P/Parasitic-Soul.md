# Parasitic Soul 

**source**:: Book of the Damned pg. 185  
**school**:: necromancy (death, evil)
**level**:: arcanist 9, cleric 9, oracle 9, psychic 9, shaman 9, sorcerer 9, witch 9, wizard 9

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (a gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: permanent (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions like *magic jar* except as noted above, and instead of your own soul, you can transfer a trapped soul (such as one trapped in a soul gem or trapped with *soul bind* or *trap the soul*) from the receptacle into an unwilling targetâ€™s body. If the target creature fails its saving throw, it dies and the trapped soul in the receptacle permanently inhabits the body as if using *magic jar*. The trapped soul does not get a saving throw to resist this transfer. To dismiss the spell, you must be within range of the possessed body.
