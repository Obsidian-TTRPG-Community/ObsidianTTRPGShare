### Description 

You augment an ongoing illusion effect to strike out painfully at creatures that see through it. When a creature successfully disbelieves an illusion that is the target of *painful revelation*, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces the nonlethal damage by half and negates the staggered effect. Once *painful revelation* has been triggered, the spell ends.  
  
However, creatures under the effect of spells such as *true seeing* that automatically pierce illusions are not subject to this effect.
