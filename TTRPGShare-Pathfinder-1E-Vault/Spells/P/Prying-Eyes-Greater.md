### Description 

This spell functions like *prying eyes*, except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had *true seeing* with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at normal speed. Also, a *greater prying eye*'s maximum Perception modifier is +25 instead of +15.
