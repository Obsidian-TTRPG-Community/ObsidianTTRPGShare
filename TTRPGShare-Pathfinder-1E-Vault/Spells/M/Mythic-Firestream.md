### Description 

A rushing stream of fire sprays from your outstretched hand, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. Each round you continue to concentrate on the spell, you can select a new area for it to affect.  
  
*Firestream* sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the firestream may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

### Mythic Description

The damage dealt increases to 2d10 points of fire damage. Any creature that fails its saving throw also catches fire (*Core Rulebook* 444). The continuous line of fire pushes against all creatures, making them treat the spell’s area as difficult terrain.  
  
**Augmented (4th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create a second line of fire using your other hand. If you overlap the lines, creatures in the overlap must attempt two saving throws and take the lower result, but don’t take damage from both lines. You may stop either line of fire as a free action on your turn, but once you stop maintaining a line, you must cast *mythic firestream* again to recreate it.
