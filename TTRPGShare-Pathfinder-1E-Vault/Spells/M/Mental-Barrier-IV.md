### Description 

This spell functions as *mental barrier III*, but if you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 25% chance that the additional damage is negated (as *light fortification*). This does not stack with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to *mind thrust I* and *II*, and you take half damage from *mind thrust III*, *IV*, and *V* (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.
