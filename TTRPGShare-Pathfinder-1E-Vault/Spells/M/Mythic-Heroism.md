### Description 

This spell imbues a single creature with great bravery and morale in battle. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks.

### Mythic Description

The morale bonus increases to +4 and applies on all checks, attack rolls, saves, and weapon damage rolls. Allies adjacent to the target gain a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can attempt one additional attack per round when taking a full attack action (as if using a *haste* spell). The target can use this additional attack ability a number of times equal to your tier.
