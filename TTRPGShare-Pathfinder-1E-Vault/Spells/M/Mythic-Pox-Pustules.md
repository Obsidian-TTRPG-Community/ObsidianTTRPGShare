# Mythic Pox Pustules

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 104  
**school**:: necromancy (disease)
**level**:: druid 2, hunter 2, witch 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (leaves from a toxic plant)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You inflict a painful, itching rash on the target creature. The target is sickened and takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity (this penalty cannot lower Dexterity below 0). The target can spend a move action scratching furiously at the rash to remove the sickened condition (but not the Dexterity penalty) until the start of its next turn.

### Mythic Description

The Dexterity penalty increases to -6. The target takes 1 point of bleed damage each round. If the target spends a move action scratching, increase its bleed damage each round by 1. If the bleeding is stopped, scratching causes it to start again at 1 point of bleed per round.
