### Description 

This spell generates what appears to be clear, pure water, but it is in fact a foul secretion known as the *waters of Lamashtu*. The liquid functions in all the same ways as unholy water (see *curse water*). In addition, any creature that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must attempt a Fortitude save (drinking the *waters of Lamashtu* is particularly effective-a creature that drinks the liquid takes a -4 penalty on its save to resist its effects). Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim’s mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subject’s Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2 ounces of the *waters of Lamashtu*-enough for one dose or, if bottled, one use as a thrown weapon.  
  
The fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the *waters of Lamashtu* (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GM’s discretion (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim).

### Mythic Description

When used as unholy water, *mythic waters of Lamashtu* deal twice as much damage and prevent the creature from regaining hit points from fast healing or regeneration for 1d4 rounds (meaning the creature can be killed normally). The ability damage from the waters increases to 2d4, and a creature imbibing or anointed by the waters is nauseated for 1d4 rounds if it fails its saving throw. The long-term effects of drinking *mythic waters of Lamashtu* happen more quickly, requiring only regular exposure over weeks instead of massive quantities for months, and warp the consuming creature more extensively (at the GM’s discretion). Monstrosities created by *mythic waters of Lamashtu* can breed with members of their original species and pass on such mutations to their offspring.
