### Description 

You grant a touched Large or smaller object the ability to fly at a speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability. It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed. The targeted object flies as you direct it, using your Fly skill for any difficult maneuvers. You must be within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of the object to direct it, and moving it requires a move action. If not directed, the object hovers in place (no Fly check required). The maximum weight of the object and anything carried by it is 500 pounds per caster level (maximum 10,000 pounds).

### Mythic Description

If you expend one use of mythic power, you double the maximum weight of the object you can imbue with flight. You can expend additional uses of mythic power to increase the maximum size of the object you can imbue with flight. Imbuing a Huge object requires two uses of mythic power, imbuing a Gargantuan object requires four uses, and imbuing a Colossal object requires eight uses. These costs include the expenditure to cast a mythic spell, and count toward doubling the weight limit of the spell.  
  
Two or more casters can cast this spell in concert to share the mythic power cost. Each caster must expend an additional use of mythic power to cooperate; this does not count toward the other costs or effects of the spell. The group chooses which caster has control of the flight. As a full-round action, the controlling caster can cede control to another caster involved in the original casting of the spell.
