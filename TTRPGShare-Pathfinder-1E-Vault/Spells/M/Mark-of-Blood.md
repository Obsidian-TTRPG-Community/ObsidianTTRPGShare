**school**:: transmutation (curse)
**level**:: arcanist 2, bloodrager 2, inquisitor 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a drop of your blood)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: one weapon touched  
**duration**:: 1 minute and permanent (see text)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You place a drop of your blood on a weapon and charge it with magic so that you transfer a small amount of your life essence to the next living creature you strike with the weapon. Thereafter, you can spend a move action to know the direction and general distance of that creature. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save. You must strike a creature within 1 minute of casting this spell or the magic is wasted, but once the mark of blood takes effect it is permanent until dispelled or removed via an effect like *remove curse*.
