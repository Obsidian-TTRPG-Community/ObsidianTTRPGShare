### Description 

This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.)  
  
Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

### Mythic Description

The cyclone becomes 15 feet wide at the base, 40 feet wide at the top, and 40 feet tall. The cyclone’s effect on Large or smaller creatures also applies to Huge creatures, and its damage increases to 3d8 points of damage. The effect on Medium or smaller creatures also applies to Large creatures, and the damage it deals each turn increases to 2d6 points of damage.  
  
**Augmented (8th)**: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the cyclone’s size increases to 50 feet wide at the base, 150 feet wide at the top, and 150 feet tall. Creatures and objects of all sizes touched by the whirlwind take 8d8 points of damage (Reflex negates), and the damage dealt to those trapped in the cyclone increases to 6d6 points of damage per round. Additionally, unattended objects smaller than 30 feet to a side are swept up in the effect. The area within 20 feet of the whirlwind is treated as severe wind (*Core Rulebook* 439), and within 40 feet it is treated as strong wind.
