# Mythic Plane Shift

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 103  
**school**:: conjuration (teleportation)
**level**:: arcanist 7, cleric 5, medium 4, oracle 5, psychic 5, shaman 7, sorcerer 7, spiritualist 5, summoner 5, summoner (unchained) 6, warpriest 5, witch 7, wizard 7

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (a forked metal rod attuned to the plane of travel)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the *plane shift* at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. *Plane shift* transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting *plane shift* again).

### Mythic Description

If you’ve been to the destination plane and are familiar with a location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant transported creatures the effects of a *planar adaptation* spell (*Advanced Player’s Guide* 236) upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.
