### Description 

*Magic weapon* gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.  
  
You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see *magic fang*). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.
