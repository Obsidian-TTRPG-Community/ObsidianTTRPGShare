### Description 

You create a sinuous line of flames that you may shape as desired. The *fire snake* affects one 5-foot square per caster level, and each square must be adjacent to the previous square, starting with you. The *fire snake* may not extend beyond its maximum range. Creatures in the path of the *fire snake* take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

### Mythic Description

The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of damage per level (maximum 15d10). Any creature that fails its saving throw against the spell is grappled by a snake made of fire that lasts for 1 round per caster level. The snake can be dispelled, but not attacked. A grappled creature takes 1d10 points of fire damage on your turn each round. The snakeâ€™s CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier, and its CMD is equal to its CMB + 10.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the maximum damage increases to 20d10, and any creature that fails its saving throw against the spell is pinned instead of grappled.
