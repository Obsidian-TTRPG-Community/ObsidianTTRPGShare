# Mental Barrier V 

**source**:: Occult Adventures pg. 176  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: psychic 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 immediate action  
**components**:: V

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round

### Description 

This functions as *mental barrier III*, but if you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the additional damage is negated (as *moderate fortification*). This does not stack with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to *mind thrust I*, *II*, and *III*, and you take half damage from *mind thrust IV*, *V*, and *VI* (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.
