# Mythic Blade Barrier

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 85  
**school**:: evocation (force)
**level**:: cleric 6, inquisitor 6, occultist 6, oracle 6, psychic 6, warpriest 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**effect**:: wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft. long/level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels; either form is 20 ft. high  
**duration**:: 1 min./level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex half or Reflex negates; see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage.  
  
If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save.  
  
A *blade barrier* provides cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) against attacks made through it.

### Mythic Description

You may cast this spell as an immediate action. The barrier’s damage increases to 1d8 per caster level (maximum 20d8).  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend a move action to move the barrier up to 10 feet in any direction. The shape (flat or ring) and orientation (vertical or horizontal) of the wall must remain the same. If you move the barrier through a creature’s space, it can attempt a saving throw to avoid the wall, as if you had created it where the creature is.
