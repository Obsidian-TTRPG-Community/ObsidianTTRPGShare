### Description 

You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.  
  
*Approach*: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.  
  
*Drop*: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.  
  
*Fall*: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.  
  
*Flee*: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.  
  
*Halt*: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.  
  
If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.

### Mythic Description

You can target up to one creature per level, each of which must receive the same command. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws are staggered for 1 round (this is a mind-affecting effect).
