### Description 

You channel lawful power to smite enemies. The power takes the form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only chaotic and neutral (not lawful) creatures are harmed by the spell.  
  
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them to be dazed for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.  
  
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

### Mythic Description

The damage dealt to chaotic outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage to other chaotic creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures in the area are dazed increases to 2 rounds. Chaotic creatures that succeed at their saves are dazed for 1 round.
