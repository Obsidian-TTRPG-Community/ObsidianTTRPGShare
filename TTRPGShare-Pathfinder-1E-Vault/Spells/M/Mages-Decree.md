### Description 

You speak a short message (up to 25 words), and it is immediately transmitted to each target, who hear it as clearly as if you were standing next to them. By default, the spell targets every creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or greater that is within the spell’s range, but at your discretion, you can choose to restrict the spell to certain creatures, causing it to either only deliver its message to creatures meeting a certain criteria, or to deliver it to all creatures except those meeting that criteria. The criteria must be something objective and observable. For example, you could cause the *mage’s decree* to reach only creatures of a certain race. You can’t choose recipients that rely on unobservable information, such as creatures of a certain alignment or of a particular class.  
  
You can’t pick and choose individual creatures to target or exclude. While the spell’s range defaults to 1 mile per caster level, you can choose to reduce it to a smaller radius, although the spell’s area can’t be shaped.  
  
The nature of the spell prevents the message it carries from having any magical power; the message can’t be used to transmit spells or abilities that are conveyed via speech. The message is transmitted in your voice in whatever language you use to speak it, and is not automatically translated. Any steps you take to disguise your voice are just as effective for messages delivered via this spell as they are for your normal speech. Mage’s decree isn’t a language-dependent spell; all targeted creatures receive the message, but might not understand it if they don’t understand the language in which you spoke the message.
