### Description 

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a *mage armor* spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.  
  
Unlike mundane armor, *mage armor* entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since *mage armor* is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

### Mythic Description

The armor bonus increases to +6. There is a 50% chance that any critical hit or sneak attack made against the target is negated and treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing *moderate fortification armor*.
