### Description 

*Web* creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn't cause you to become grappled.  
  
Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell's DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter.  
  
If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.  
  
The strands of a *web* spell are flammable. A *flaming weapon* can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.  
  
*Web* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

### Mythic Description

The webs are filled with spider swarms (one spider swarm for each 10-foot-by-10-foot area covered in webs). Any creature caught in or moving through the webs is attacked by a spider swarm (or multiple swarms, if it passes through the space of more than one swarm). The spiders donâ€™t leave the area of webbing. Destroying the web in an area destroys the swarm there as well, and completely destroying the web destroys all the swarms.  
  
**Augmented (5th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the webs increase to a 50-foot-radius spread. Webs span any gaps between available anchor points in the area, possibly creating multiple non-contiguous webbed areas. Non-mythic abilities that make creatures immune to webs (such as *freedom of movement*) instead give them a +5 bonus on saves, combat maneuver checks, and Escape Artist checks against *mythic web*.
