### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect 

**range**:: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**duration**:: 1 min./level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none

### Description 

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by *faerie fire* take a -20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical *darkness* effect functions normally), *blur*, *displacement*, *invisibility*, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The *faerie fire* can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The *faerie fire* does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

### Mythic Description

Outlined creatures are dazzled. The spell outlines figment illusions in the burst, revealing them as such. This effect applies only to figments with a caster level equal to or less than your tier.  
  
**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, each creature in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round.
