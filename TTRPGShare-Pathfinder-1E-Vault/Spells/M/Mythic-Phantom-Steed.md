### Description 

You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.  
  
The mount is AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.  
  
These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.  
  
*8th Level*: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.  
  
*10th Level*: The mount can use *water walk* at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).  
  
*12th Level*: The mount can use *air walk* at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.  
  
*14th Level*: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.

### Mythic Description

The steed’s rider automatically succeeds at Ride checks to remain mounted. The mount’s hit points increase to 10 plus 2 per caster level, and its speed increases to 30 feet per 2 caster levels (maximum 150 feet).  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the phantom steed is incorporeal, but its rider can interact with it normally.
