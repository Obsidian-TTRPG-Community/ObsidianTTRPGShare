### Description 

You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light.  
  
If *daylight* is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.  
  
*Daylight* brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.  
  
*Daylight* counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as *darkness*.

### Mythic Description

The illumination in the additional 60 foot radius increases to at least normal light regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Creatures that take penalties in bright light double those penalties while in the area of bright light produced by this spell. All other creatures in the area of bright light gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks and saves to resist fear.
