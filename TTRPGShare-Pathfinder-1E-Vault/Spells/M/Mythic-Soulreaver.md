### Mythic Description

You can expend one use of mythic power to raise creatures killed by this effect as undead thralls. You can animate a number of Hit Dice worth of undead up to double your tier as if you had animated them with *animate dead*. The undead created by this spell count toward the total number of Hit Dice worth of undead you can control.  
  
**Augmented (8th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can raise slain foes as undead creatures chosen from the list of undead for *create undead*. By expending three uses of mythic power, you can select from the list for *create greater undead*. The total number of Hit Dice worth of undead created in this way can’t exceed double your tier. Created undead are not automatically under your control. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creatures as they form.
