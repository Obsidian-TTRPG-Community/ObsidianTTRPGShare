### Description 

You breathe out a blast of energy. Creatures in the affected area take 1d6 points of energy damage per caster level (maximum of 12d6). A successful Reflex save results in half damage. The spell’s effect and energy type depend on the type of dragon scale used:  
  
*Black dragon*: 60-foot line of acid.  
*Blue or bronze dragon*: 60-foot line of electricity.  
*Green dragon*: 30-foot cone of acid.  
*Gold or red dragon*: 30-foot cone of fire.  
*Silver or white dragon*: 30-foot cone of cold.  
*Brass dragon*: 60-foot line of fire.  
*Copper dragon*: 60-foot line of acid.

### Mythic Description

The spell’s duration changes to 1 minute/level or until discharged. You can use the breath weapon up to three times during this duration. On the round you cast the spell, using the breath weapon is a free action; later uses require a standard action. You must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of the breath weapon. All uses for a particular casting have the same range, area, and energy type. You can have only one *dragon’s breath* spell in effect at a time; casting a new one ends the previous one.
