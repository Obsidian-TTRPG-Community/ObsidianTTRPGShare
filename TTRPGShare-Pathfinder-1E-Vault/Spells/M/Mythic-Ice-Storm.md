### Description 

Great magical hailstones pound down upon casting this spell, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, heavy snow and sleet rains down in the area. Creatures inside this area take a -4 penalty on Perception skill checks and the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the snow and hail disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).

### Mythic Description

The bludgeoning damage increases to 4d8 points of damage and the cold damage increases to 3d6 points of damage. The ground in the area is covered in ice and hailstones, acting as though a *grease* spell were cast on it. Dealing 5 or more points of fire damage to a square melts the ice and hail, negating the *grease* effect.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, one creature in the area is paralyzed (as if by *hold person*) and gains vulnerability to fire as long as itâ€™s paralyzed.
