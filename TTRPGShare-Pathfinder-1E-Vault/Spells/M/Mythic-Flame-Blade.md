**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the *flame blade* are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A *flame blade* can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

### Mythic Description

The bladeâ€™s damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 18-20 as if it were an actual scimitar.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 15-20, and bypasses hardness, fire resistance, and fire immunity.
