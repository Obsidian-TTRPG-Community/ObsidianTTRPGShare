    desc: Once per day as a swift action, a great cyclops can gain a burst of savage inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all attacks using weapons, natural attacks, and rock attacks it makes until the start of its next turn. Furthermore, once per day when the great cyclops reaches 0 or fewer hit points and is conscious because of its Diehard feat, this ability recharges, allowing the great cyclops to use the ability a second time that day.

# Description
In the jungles of the south, great cyclopes roam. Some brutes are especially dangerous, raining down furious blows with their huge greatclubs, and stunning and smashing foes in a blood-red rage. The roaring cries of savage great cyclopes can be heard echoing through the jungles as a warning for all other creatures to f lee before its wrath.
