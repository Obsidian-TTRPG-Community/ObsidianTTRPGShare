# Description
In Osirion, these massive beetles are a threat to ancient tombs as they chew their way through the interred. Some say scarab beetlesâ€™ connection with the dead gives them powers greater than those of normal beetles, but any evidence of this has yet to been proven true. Merchants claim powdered scarab is an essential element in magic that protects against death effects.
