special_abilities:
  - name: Colonize Victim (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a spore stalker can inject spores into the body of a Small or larger living, corporeal, nonplant creature that is pinned or helpless. The victim can resist the spores’ infestation with a successful DC 19 Fortitude save. If it fails this save, the victim takes 1d2 points of Constitution drain per round for 6 rounds but can attempt a new DC 19 Fortitude save to end the effect each round, similar to saving against a poison (although this is not a poison effect). Multiple colonizations do not increase the Constitution damage or save DC, but they do increase the duration of the effect by 6 rounds per infestation. A creature that perishes from this Constitution damage splits open, and a fully grown spore stalker crawls from the rapidly decaying remains. This is an infestation effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Paralytic Spores (Ex)
    desc: When a spore stalker is hit by a melee or ranged weapon, it can release a cloud of paralytic spores in a 5-foot radius around itself as an immediate action. Any creature within range when the cloud is released must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d3 rounds. At the start of a creature’s turn, it can attempt a new DC 19 Fortitude save as a standard action to end this paralysis effect early. This is a poison effect; the save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Reactive Escape (Su)
    desc: Whenever a spore stalker is hit by a melee or ranged weapon, it can teleport up to 30 feet in any direction as an immediate action. This ability otherwise functions as per dimension door (CL 7th).

# Description
Capable of spreading and colonizing with disturbing speed, a spore stalker and its kin can quickly overrun an area. Fortunately, a spore stalker’s life span is relatively short; a typical spore stalker perishes of natural causes in only a few weeks. Spore stalkers are often used by mi-go or agents of the Dominion of the Black as biological weapons against unsuspecting citizens of newly discovered planets.
