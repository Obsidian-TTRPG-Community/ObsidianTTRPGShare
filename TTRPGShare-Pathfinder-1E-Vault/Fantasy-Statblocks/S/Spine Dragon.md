special_abilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Ex)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a spine dragon can emit a devastating shriek of powerful sonic energy in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this cone take 20d6 sonic damage and are permanently deafened. A DC 27 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the deafness. This sonic damage is particularly devastating to constructs-they take a -4 penalty to save against its effects, and if they fail the save, they are staggered for 1d4 rounds as well. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Ray Deflection (Su)
    desc: A spine dragon’s scales deflect rays and magic missile spells, rendering the spine dragon immune to such effects. There’s a 30% chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise, it is simply negated.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    desc: A spine dragon’s body is covered with long, crystalline spines. It can fire up to four of these spines per round as a full-attack action (or one as a standard action). A creature that attacks a spine dragon with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon must make a DC 20 Reflex save or take 2d8+11 points of piercing damage from the spines. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

# Description
Particularly notorious in the badlands of Numeria, spine dragons are similar in appearance to true dragons, but do not progress through draconic age categories. Their abilities and defenses make them singularly adept at handling the alien threats and strange constructs that lurk in this realm, and as a result, spine dragons have become one of Numeria’s most successful predators.

Of course, a spine dragon is much more than a predator. As with many true dragons, spine dragons are particularly vain and enjoy being groveled to. It’s not uncommon for them to assume the role of god for ignorant tribes of giants. They also have a particular love of crystalline treasure and magic items-a spine dragon’s horde is usually sparse on the classic “carpet of coins” but just as valuable overall in content as those of true dragons.

A spine dragon is 60 feet long and 20 feet high, and weighs 16,000 pounds.
