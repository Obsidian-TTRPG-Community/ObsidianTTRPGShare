    desc: Every 1d4 rounds, a somalcygot can spit a 60-foot line of acid that deals 10d6 points of acid damage. The acid continues to burn, causing each affected creature to take an additional 5d6 points of acid damage on the following round. A successful DC 26 Reflex save halves the initial damage and negates the ongoing damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Resistant Evolution (Su)
    desc: Somalcygots have evolved in the harsh, unforgiving vacuum of space and developed fortified resistances to the myriad threats found in their environment, granting them a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

# Description
Somalcygots are incredibly territorial; each claims roughly a mile-radius patch of desolate surface on a moon, asteroid, or similar airless terrestrial environment as its chosen hunting ground, and enters another’s territory only to mate. Somalcygots can digest nearly any organic matter, but because they usually live on barren terrain, they often go for long intervals without a meal. In order to preserve energy between meals, a somalcygot enters a trancelike hibernation during which it burrows in circles beneath the surface of its territory with unthinking repetition. When it detects another creature nearby, the somalcygot awakens and enters a frenzy to capitalize on the rare meal, fighting relentlessly until the prey either dies or escapes. Only rarely do somalcygots pursue prey beyond the boundaries of their claimed hunting grounds, a tendency that serves both to preserve the creature’s energy and to avoid needless conf lict with other somalcygots that claim neighboring regions.

 A typical adult somalcygot is 16 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.
