# Description
Like other giant jellyfish, a sapphire jellyfish is an active hunter. It stores powerful electrical charges in its domelike bell, which is 16 feet in diameter. Its sensory tentacles can trail for twice that length, but the dangerous toxic tentacles are positioned within about 20 feet of the creature’s bell.
