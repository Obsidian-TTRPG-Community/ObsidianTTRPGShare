# Description
Organization solitary, pair, or infestation (3-12)
Treasure noneDescriptionMost creatures that die in the desert are consumed by roaming scavengers or buried forever by sand, yet those who avoid such a fate bake under the merciless sun. Such desiccated corpses near pyramids or other areas with strong necromantic magic sometimes rise as sunbaked zombies. With their corporeal bodies warped by the sun, and their innards but a dry facsimile of living organs, sunbaked zombies use the gifts of the sun to lash those who cross their paths. A sunbaked zombie is the same size as its original form, but typically weighs less than half its original weight.
