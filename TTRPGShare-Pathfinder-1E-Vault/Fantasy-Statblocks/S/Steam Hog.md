    desc: As a standard action, a steam hog can emit a cloud of steam from its snout in a 10-foot-radius spread. The initial burst of steam deals 2d6 points of fire damage to any creature in the area. The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds once created, acting as a 10-foot-radius obscuring mist. Any creature that begins its turn in the area of the steam must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. A steam hog can use its steam cloud only once every 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
The military advancements of fire giants aren’t restricted only to arms and armor-just as ore is dredged from the mountains for these giants’ cruel forges, animals are culled from the wilds to serve as fire giant weaponry. In addition to using hell hounds, red dragons, and other fiery fauna for their brutal campaigns, fire giants have created several unique species of war beasts all their own. Chief among these amalgamations of flesh and steel are the malformed swine known as steam hogs-enormous snorting brutes charged with heading the front lines of fire giant armies, each one capable of laying low an entire platoon of enemy soldiers.

 While fire giants are more than capable of crafting new armor for their steam hogs, they take great pleasure in bedecking their prized war beasts with the reforged arms and armor of their vanquished foes. In this way, the armor and accoutrements of a veteran steam hog serve as a record of the battles and wars the beast has fought in. When such a steam hog falls in battle, its armor-and thus its history-are often kept by sentimental fire giant handlers as treasured heirlooms. Steam hogs average 16 feet long from snout to tail and 8 feet tall at the shoulder. They can weigh up to 3 tons, or 4 tons when equipped with adamantine scale barding.
