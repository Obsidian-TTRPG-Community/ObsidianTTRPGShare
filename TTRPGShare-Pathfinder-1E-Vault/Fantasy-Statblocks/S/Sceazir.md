special_abilities:
  - name: Bond of the Void (Su)
    desc: Sceazirs have an innate connection with sceaduinars and can intuitively understand their commands. A sceazir with a sceaduinar rider forms a telepathic connection with the rider, allowing the sceaduinar to control its sceazir mount as a free action. A sceazir follows the commands of a sceaduinar rider to the best of its ability, but it almost never allows any other creature to use it as a mount.
  - name: Entropic Ruin (Ex)
    desc: When a sceazir is slain, its body explodes in a burst of negative energy. All creatures within a 20-foot burst take 8d6 points of negative energy damage and become fatigued. A creature can halve this damage and negate the fatigue with a successful DC 20 Reflex save. If a creature was already fatigued when it fails this save, it becomes exhausted instead. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Voidfury (Ex)
    desc: Sceazirs have an instinctive loathing for positive energy. When targeted with positive energy (such as a cure spell or channeled energy), a sceazir immediately flies into a fury, as the rage spell, for 2d6 rounds.

desc_short: This winged, six-legged creature seems to be constructed of dark crystal. Its mouth is disproportionately large for its wolfish head, gaping open to display rows of jagged teeth, and its spiky, manyjointed legs bend in unsettling ways.

# Description
Vicious and brutal predators, sceazirs are born from the substance of the Negative Energy Plane in much the same way as the plane’s more intelligent inhabitants, sceaduinars. Though they possess only an animalistic intelligence, sceazirs loathe all forms of life and unlife and are quick to hunt down anything they detect in their territory that is not native to the Negative Energy Plane. They are unnaturally fast, moving with equal ease on the ground or through the air. Due to sceazirs’ speed and skill at tracking, sceaduinars often use them as mounts or beasts of burden. Sceazirs can understand the commands of a sceaduinar rider through a telepathic bond and carry out such commands obediently, but they almost never accept non-sceaduinar riders.

 A sceazir is typically 11 feet long, stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 900 pounds.
