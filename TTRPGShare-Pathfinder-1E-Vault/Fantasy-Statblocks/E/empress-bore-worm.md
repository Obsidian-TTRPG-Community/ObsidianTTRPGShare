  - name: Viviparous Birth (Ex)
    desc: In an effort to preserve the next generation, an empress bore worm violently expunges any young .it may be carrying when it dies; these young function as 1d6 bore worm swarms (see page 82).

# Description
A single, finger-length bore worm has never been much of a threat to any one creature, but isolated bore worms are found only in laboratories. Bore worm swarms, as they are more commonly encountered, consume organic material with a voracious appetite, tunneling through the earth like water as they reach progressively larger sizes.
