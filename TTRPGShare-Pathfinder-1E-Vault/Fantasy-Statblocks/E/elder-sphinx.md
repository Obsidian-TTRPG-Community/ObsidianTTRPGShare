special_abilities:
  - name: Enciphered Mind (Su)
    desc: The forbidden knowledge elder sphinxes have accumulated is etched on their psyches, and it causes great harm to those who attempt to make psychic contact. Any creature attempting to contact an elder sphinx’s mind or read its thoughts with a divination spell or similar ability must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be overwhelmed by the chaos and vast scope of the knowledge within. Those who fail are affected by feeblemind. An elder sphinx can willingly suppress this ability at will as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Enigma (Su)
    desc: Elder sphinxes have removed themselves from the mundane world to contemplate the mysteries of the universe-and beyond. To facilitate this, they possess an uncanny ability to elude detection and discovery by those that could possibly interrupt their meditations. Any creature (other than another sphinx), that leaves line of sight of an elder sphinx for more than 1 hour must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be unable to recall details of the encounter, as if the sphinx cast modify memory to eliminate all recollection of itself. The exact details of this memory loss are decided by the elder sphinx subconsciously during the encounter and it may eliminate up to an hour of memories. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Litany of Riddles (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, an elder sphinx can telepathically project a befuddling series of riddles, puzzles, and logic paradoxes at all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this effect must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed against this effect glean snippets of lore from this brush with the sphinx’s mind, granting them a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks for 1 hour and the ability to attempt Knowledge checks with a DC higher than 10 untrained. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it can’t be affected by the same elder sphinx’s litany of riddles for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Sphinx Monolith (Su)
    desc: An elder sphinx can enter a state of suspended animation and transform its massive body into a stone monument. This transformation takes 1 minute to complete, during which the elder sphinx is immobile. Once it transforms into its monolith form, the elder sphinx’s body hardens to stone, granting it hardness 30 and 350 hit points. If the elder sphinx’s stony body is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the elder sphinx is slain. While transformed, an elder sphinx doesn’t need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. The elder sphinx is aware of its surroundings and it can use astral projection at will when in this form. Anytime an elder sphinx’s body takes damage while using astral projection, its astral form immediately becomes aware that it is in danger and can, as a free action, end the astral projection and begin reverting back to its natural form (though the process still takes 1 minute). When an elder sphinx ends its transformation, it is immediately healed of all hit point damage it may have sustained while transformed. An elder sphinx can remain in its sphinx monolith form indefinitely.

# Description
Older than most modern civilizations, elder sphinxes are the wisest and most venerable of sphinx kind. Though they have long since calcified into creatures of living limestone, these ancient creatures serve eternally as guardians, not of temples or other such terrestrial sites, but of forbidden knowledge and lore, much of which is beyond the understanding of lesser beings. Elder sphinxes are highly protective of the vast wealth of information they possess and strive to defend it from those they deem unworthy.
