special_abilities:
  - name: Charisma Drain (Su)
    desc: A bite from an erodaemon’s tail deals 1d4 points of Charisma drain to the victim. This can be reduced to 1d2 points of Charisma damage with a successful DC 22 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Object of Desire (Su)
    desc: While using detect thoughts on a humanoid, an erodaemon can identify the person the target most desires, whether it is a loved one or an object of lust. As a full-round action, the erodaemon can change into the form of this desired person as long as the desired person is a Small, Medium, or Large humanoid. The erodaemon gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise and Bluff checks to impersonate that person and avoid being detected as a fraud. This effect ends if the erodaemon attacks any creature.
  - name: Wilting Kiss (Su)
    desc: As a free action, an erodaemon can draw a willing, helpless, or grappled mortal into a state of obsession with its kiss. The kissed creature must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become supernaturally obsessed with the erodaemon. Each round the victim is more than 30 feet away from the erodaemon, the victim must attempt an additional DC 23 Will save. Failure means that the sheer pain of the erodaemon’s absence deals 1 point of Charisma damage to the subject that round. Succeeding at this Will save two consecutive times ends the effects of this ability. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

# Description
Erodaemons are the personification of death by heartbreak. Occasionally, erodaemons will work together, but only if doing so results in a greater harvest of crushed mortal souls. In her true form, an erodaemon is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
