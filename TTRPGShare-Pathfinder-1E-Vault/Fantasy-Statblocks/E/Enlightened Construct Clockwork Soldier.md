# Description
Infused with powerful psychic energy, enlightened constructs have access to strange and deadly mental powers. Highly intelligent and secretive, these constructs typically serve as henchmen to powerful psychics or sorcerous cabals.

 The sample enlightened construct above uses a clockwork soldier as the base creature. See that entry for full descriptions of its base abilities.
