# Description
A crocodile is a primeval reptile that dwells in swamps or along the banks of rivers, a habitat that often puts it in violent contact with unsuspecting prey that come to the waterâ€™s edge to drink.

The typical crocodile is 14 feet long and weighs 1,400 pounds, but larger species exist. You can use these statistics for similar creatures, such as alligators.
