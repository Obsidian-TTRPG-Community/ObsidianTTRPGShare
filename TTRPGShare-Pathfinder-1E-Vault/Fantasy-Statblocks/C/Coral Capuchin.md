  - name: Cursed Bite (Su)
    desc: A coral capuchin’s bite bestows some of the creature’s benefits and weaknesses upon the victim unless the victim succeeds at a DC 12 Constitution check. The curse delivered by this bite persists for 1d6 hours, and cannot affect the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period. Affected creatures can hold their breath for double the normal amount of time, but begin drying out when exposed to air. Victims take 1d6 points of damage for every 10 minutes they are out of water, though spending a full-round action to bathe the victim in any sort of water halts this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Moisture
  - name: Dependency (Ex)
    desc: A coral capuchin can breathe both air and water and survive indefinitely on land, but the creature must regularly be either submerged in water or thoroughly wetted down, or else it dries out. A coral capuchin can remain out of water for a number of hours of equal to its Constitution score before it suffers any negative effects. After this time, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage for every hour it remains dry. Bathing the creature in water of any sort resets this time frame.

# Description
Coral capuchins live in tropical coastal areas, generally in small familial groups of fewer than 30 adults led by an older matriarch (see below). Wholly unafraid of most humanoid species, coral capuchins are often befriended by sailors and fishers willing to put up with the creatures’ incurable curiosity and penchant for petty larceny. They can be trained to fish for their allies and are particularly sought after by those who make their living bringing up treasures from the ocean floor. Their voracious, omnivorous appetites also make them popular on long ocean voyages, as they are happy to reduce ships’ endemic rat populations. Perhaps because of this, many sailors see them as good-luck mascots, although they are most popular with pirates, smugglers, and other seafaring folk who more willingly accept their thieving nature. 

Despite their mercurial temperaments and propensity for theft, coral capuchins are prized by wizards because of the creatures’ exceptional mobility and their strange cursed bite. Spellcasters of 3rd level or higher with an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a coral capuchin as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat.
