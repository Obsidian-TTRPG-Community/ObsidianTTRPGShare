# Description
These constructs are the pinnacle of clockwork inventions. An ingenious combination of mechanical devices and magical conduits allows a clockwork mage to channel the power of a wand into a variety of arcane powers. They often serve powerful arcane spellcasters, or as unflinching and unquestioning casters to those who wants the benefit of spells without ego or free thought.

A humanoid figure of mithral and steel, a clockwork mage has large crystal ball filled with shifting vapors for a head. It stands 7 feet tall.
