    desc: The crystal embedded into a clockwork priestâ€™s chest serves as a divine focus, granting it a number of spell-like abilities (CL 11th). The spells it can use are determined by its cleric domain and whether the creator instilled positive or negative energy into the creation. Once chosen, the domain and type of energy cannot be changed. A clockwork priest can cast either cure or inflict spells (depending on the energy it was instilled with at creation) of 1st through 3rd levels, as well as the spells granted by its chosen domain up to 3rd level. It can cast 1st-level spells at will, 2nd-level spells three times per day, and 3rd-level spells once per day. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.

# Description
A clockwork priest combines raw divine energy with clockwork engineering through an integrated divine focus nestled in its chest. Through divine conduits and specially sanctified parts, these creations act as vessels of divinities, granting them a reservoir of divine energy they can use to generate spell effects. They often serve as healers, offering aid to the afflicted and to those ravaged in battle. Because of their unwavering loyalty to their deities, clockwork priests are willing to sacrifice themselves for their missions.

 Within a church, clockwork priests serve as assistants and aides, carrying out commands with unquestioned loyalty. While rare, churches staffed entirely by clockwork priests do exist. Stories tell of cathedrals dedicated to Amaznen, the Azlanti god of invention and magic, still operating in the ruins of Azlant, despite the fact that that god is now dead.
