special_abilities:
  - name: Acid Spit (Ex)
    desc: A chon chon can spit a disgusting blob of acid at a single foe, making a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet and no range increment. A successful attack deals 2d4 points of acid damage and forces the target to make a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Jabber (Su)
    desc: A chon chon swarm mutters even more loudly than a solitary chon chon. Any creature attempting to cast a spell within 30 feet of a chon chon must make a successful DC 11 concentration check or lose the spell. This is a sonic, mindaffecting effect. The concentration DC is Charisma-based.

Chon chons appear to be human heads with ears so grotesquely enlarged that they can serve as f leshy wings. Their jealous hatred of all beings with full bodies easily counters their comical appearance, however. Accursed creatures drawn to places of dark magic and arcane disasters, chon chons possess the desires of the most obsessed magic users, but their dementia and twisted forms prevent them from ever obtaining the power they seek. Although these crazed beings loathe all things, they do find a vicious kind of solace among their own kind, not out of any sort of commiseration, but rather by wallowing in the pain of their own kind. Such hateful swarms gather to bear witness to each others’ misery, inadvertently increasing the deadly efficacy of the entire group.

A single chon chon is no larger than a human head and weighs 10 pounds at most. The creature’s ears give it a total wingspan of 3 feet, making it appear much larger and more menacing.
