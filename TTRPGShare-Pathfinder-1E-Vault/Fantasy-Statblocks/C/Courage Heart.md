    desc: standard (+4 darkwood breastplate, other treasure)
special_abilities:
  - name: Bloody Rose (Su)
    desc: At will as a free action, the herald can create a thorny red rose. She may use this rose as a +1 anarchic dart as if she had the Quick Draw feat. The rose loses all its powers 1 round after it leaves the herald’s hand.
  - name: Darkwood Breastplate
    desc: The herald’s +4 darkwood breastplate has all the normal properties of darkwood but is as hard and strong as steel (similar to wood created with an ironwood spell).
  - name: Favored Enemy (Ex)
    desc: The herald has the favored enemy ability of a 17th-level ranger.
  - name: Imbue with Power (Su)
    desc: The herald can imbue an ally with a portion of her power. This ability functions like imbue with spell ability, except she may transfer uses of the following spell-like abilities as if they were cleric spells: cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, peasant armaments, protection from arrows, shield other, and status. Using this ability reduces the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability until she dismisses the transfer or the recipient expends it (for example, if she imbues a target with cure moderate wounds, thereafter she can only use that spell-like ability twice per day).
  - name: Martyr’s Blood (Su)
    desc: By marking an ally with her blood, the herald can transfer part of her fast healing ability to that ally. The herald’s fast healing decreases by 1 (minimum 0), and the ally gains fast healing 1 for 1 hour. This ability has no effect if the target already has fast healing.
  - name: Rebellious Aura (Su)
    desc: The herald’s aura grants allies within 60 feet the effects of good hope and a paladin’s aura of courage. The effects of this ability are included in the herald’s stat block.
  - name: Tactician (Ex)
    desc: The herald has the tactician ability of a 17th-level cavalier (4/day, one teamwork feat, all allies within 30 feet, 11 rounds). She may use this ability with any of her teamwork feats (Lookout, Outflank, Swap Places).

desc_short: This woman with vaguely half-elven features wears a wooden breastplate and wields a wooden morningstar in one hand. In her other hand she holds a thorny red rose; blood from that hand trickles down her arm.

# Description
Courage Heart is a weapon against tyranny and a mighty spark that kindles the fires of hope in mortal hearts. Once a mortal ranger in the service of Milani, she was an early champion of Galt’s Red Revolution when its purpose was to depose evil Chelish nobles, but when that movement become more about chaos and vengeance, she fought against it instead. Eventually branded a Chelish sympathizer by the Revolutionary Council, she allowed herself to be captured in order to allow her allies to escape. She was executed with a final blade, which trapped her soul within it.

Milani, having spent a century communicating directly with her followers, saw the merits of having a divine champion like other deities, and plucked the woman’s soul from the artifact and made her a herald. Now the martyred hero keeps her original name secret so her living relatives in Galt do not become targets by association, and calls herself Courage Heart. Her mission is twofold: to attack the powerful enemies of the church (especially immortal undead who would subjugate the common folk and conjured outsiders used to strike fear into mortal hearts), and to inspire hope among mortals so they can find the strength to turn against tyrants.

As Courage Heart opposes slavery and unjust imprisonment, she has made it her personal crusade to steal all the final blades and free the souls within them. Milani must look at the bigger picture, so the herald has to make progress toward this goal when she can. Courage Heart has been trying to get Pharasma’s herald, the Steward of the Skein, to join her cause, as preventing souls from reaching the Boneyard is of interest to the Lady of Graves, but that herald’s strange nature and the recent creation of the final blades (relative to the history of civilization) means she has made little headway in establishing that alliance to date.
