special_abilities:
  - name: Explosive Rend (Su)
    desc: When a clockwork fiend makes two successful claw attacks against the same target in 1 round, its claws ignite into an explosive blast of fire. The target of the attack and all creatures within a 5-foot radius of the clockwork fiend take 10d6 points of fire damage. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Overdrive (Su)
    desc: Once per day when a clockwork fiend is reduced below 100 hit points, its internal systems significantly augment the construct. Entering overdrive drastically reduces the clockwork fiend’s remaining winding time, and as a result, the clockwork fiend can operate for only 2d4+10 rounds before it ceases to function and requires further winding. Once overdrive is triggered, the clockwork fiend immediately gains the following effects for as long as it remains functional. • Gains 100 temporary hit points. These hit points last until the clockwork fiend ceases functioning or is rewound. • Gains an aura of fire. All creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the clockwork fiend’s turn. • Makes all attacks as if using Power Attack (-6 on attack rolls, +12 points of damage on all natural attacks).
  - name: Savage Bite (Ex)
    desc: A clockwork fiend’s bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 and deals triple damage on a successful critical hit.
