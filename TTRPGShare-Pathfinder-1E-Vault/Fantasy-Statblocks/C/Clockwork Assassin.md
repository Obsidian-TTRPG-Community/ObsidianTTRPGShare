special_abilities:
  - name: Integrated Rapier (Ex)
    desc: One of a clockwork assassin’s arms ends in an integrated +1 rapier. This weapon cannot be disarmed, sundered, or removed, and becomes nonmagical if the clockwork is destroyed. A clockwork assassin’s programming allows it to wield its +1 rapier as if it were proficient in its use.
  - name: Projectile Launcher (Ex)
    desc: A clockwork can fire up to four projectiles from its hand mechanism. For each projectile, it chooses between a dagger-like metal blade or a smoke bomb, in any combination it wishes. Each attack resolves separately. Blades resolve as thrown daggers. Smoke bombs function as smokesticks centered on the area targeted. When created, a clockwork assassin’s projectile launcher contains 40 blades and 10 smoke bombs.
  - name: Rapid Repair (Su)
    desc: A clockwork assassin repairs damage dealt to itself swiftly, gaining fast healing 10. Once per day, as a full round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a clockwork assassin can bolster its rapid repair to heal 40 hp and refill its projectile launcher with eight blades and two smoke bombs.
  - name: Standby (Ex)
    desc: A clockwork assassin can place itself on standby as a standard action. While on standby, it cannot move or take any actions. It remains aware of its surroundings but takes a -4 penalty on Perception checks. Time spent on standby does not count against its wind-down duration. A clockwork assassin can exit standby as a swift action-if it does so to initiate combat, it gains a +4 racial bonus on its Initiative check.
