# Description
Born of mysterious origins and raised by unknowing foster parents, changelings are the children of hags and their tricked lovers. Most don’t know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every changeling’s life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging the confused girl toward some end she can’t identify. When a hag of any sort conceives a child with a man, the result is a changeling. The male parent is usually killed and eaten by his partner before he can see the offspring.

Changelings are, without exception, female, and almost always tall and slender. A changeling’s hair is typically long and dark, and her skin abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes like a member of her father’s race. A frequent-but not universal-trait of changelings is noticeably mismatched eyes, each of which is a different color common among her father’s race. Upon reaching puberty and adulthood, the average changeling born to a human father stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds.
