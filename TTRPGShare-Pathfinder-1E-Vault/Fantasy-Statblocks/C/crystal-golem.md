special_abilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    desc: A crystal golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A shatter spell damages a crystal golem as if it were a crystalline creature, and slows it (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw).A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.Any attempt at direct possession (such as the possession spell but not dominate monster) can affect a crystal golem. The golem does not resist these effects if they come from its creator or targets designated by its creator. Against all other attempts at intrusion, the golem receives a Will save at a +5 bonus.
  - name: Psychic Amplification (Su)
    desc: Each time a creature within 30 feet of a crystal golem uses a psychic spell or spell-like ability, the caster can choose to gain the benefit of either the Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Intuitive Spell, or Logical Spell metamagic feat without requiring a full-round action to cast. Only one such feat can be applied to a given casting. A crystal golem can use the spell-like abilities from its psychic magic as a swift action, and all its spell-like ability save DCs are Wisdom-based.
