# Description
Poppets resemble humanoid mannequins standing 1 foot tall and weighing 6 pounds. Their faces have only the crudest features, if any at all.

 Each poppet is connected to a wooden token as a part of its creation, typically shaped into a doll or piece of jewelry. The poppet follows orders given by the individual keyed to this token, so long as that individual carries or wears the token. The individual currently keyed to the token can give it to another-transferring control of the poppet-in a 1-minute ritual. This transfer is typical when a poppet is sold to a new owner.

 Poppets have no minds of their own, and so carry out orders explicitly as they are instructed, even if their situation makes the command nonsensical. Poppets can only perform simple manual labor, but they can be commanded to perform simple tasks at certain times, or when certain conditions are met.
