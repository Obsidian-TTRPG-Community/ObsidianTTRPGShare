# Description
Poisonous frogs are a bright green color, with additional bright yellow, red, or blue markings. They are just over a foot long and weigh 10 pounds. The poison of poisonous frogs is often gathered by primitive tribes and used to coat darts and arrows for hunting.

You can make a larger poison frog either by applying the giant simple template or by giving a normal giant frog a poison frogâ€™s venomous bite.
