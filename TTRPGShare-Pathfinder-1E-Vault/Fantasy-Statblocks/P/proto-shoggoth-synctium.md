  - name: Distracting Cacophony (Su)
    desc: Although a syncytium is not intelligent enough to understand language, its halfformed mouths constantly emit a distracting cacophony of sounds and nonsense words. A syncytium can activate this ability is a free action. All other creatures in a 30-foot radius must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by this proto-shoggothâ€™s distracting cacophony again for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Merge (Ex)
    desc: As a full-round action, two proto-shoggoth syncytia can attempt to merge (see the Merge entry in the proto-shoggoth stat block on page 90); each must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save in order to merge. If both succeed at this save, they combine to form a fully-grown shoggoth (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 249).

Early attempts by the elder things (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 85) to craft life resulted in strange, heaving masses of protoplasm that displayed a disturbing hunger for living flesh. Emboldened by this discovery, the alien scientists soon stabilized this matter, resulting in the creation of the first proto-shoggoths.

A proto-shoggoth appears as a tangled mass of roiling flesh and organs weighing approximately 160 pounds, and is capable of forming all manner of hideous and nauseating shapes.
