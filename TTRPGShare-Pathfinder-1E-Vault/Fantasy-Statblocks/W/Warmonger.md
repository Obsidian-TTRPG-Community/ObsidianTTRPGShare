  - name: Automatic Crossbow (Ex)
    desc: Bolts fired from a warmonger’s automatic crossbow have a range increment of 100 feet and deal 3d8 points of piercing damage, with a critical threat range of 19-20. The weapon creates ammunition magically as needed and can fire up to four bolts per round as part of a full attack. A warmonger can throw one rock in the same round that it attacks with its automatic crossbow, but cannot throw rocks or use its crossbow in the same round it makes melee attacks.
  - name: Fortified Construction (Ex)
    desc: A warmonger gains an additional 150 bonus hit points in addition to the 40 bonus hit points a Huge construct gains.
  - name: Warmonger Weaponry (Ex)
    desc: A warmonger’s weapons are all primary natural attacks. The reaper deals slashing damage, the siege pick piercing damage, and the wrecking ball bludgeoning damage. Creatures damaged by the wrecking ball are stunned for 1 round unless they succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
