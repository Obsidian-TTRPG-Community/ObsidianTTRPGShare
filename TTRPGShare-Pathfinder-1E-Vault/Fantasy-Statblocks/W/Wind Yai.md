special_abilities:
  - name: Roaring Gale (Su)
    desc: As a standard action three times per day, a wind yai can select a point within sight on which to conjure a violent updraft, violently flinging its opponents into the air. When it uses this ability, the wind yai must make a single bull rush combat maneuver check (CMB equal to the wind yai’s caster level + its Cha bonus; +21 for most wind yai) against all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst. Any creature with a CMD score lower than the result of this check is hurled 1d6 × 10 feet straight up, and lands prone in a spot 1d4 × 5 feet from its original position. The wind yai selects the direction it wishes to throw its victims, and may select a different direction for each victim, though each must be thrown in a straight line. Creatures take falling damage for any impacts while traveling up or down in this way; if a creature collides with an object during its sideways movement, both the creature and the object take 1d6 points of damage and the creature is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.
  - name: Shocking Missile (Su)
    desc: As a swift action, a wind yai can fire a bolt of electricity from its third eye as a ranged touch attack. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment, and deals 4d6 points of damage. If the creature struck is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it instead takes 4d8 points of damage. Upon being struck by this attack, the victim must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Wind yai may take after the graceful cloud giants in general appearance, but given their hard, icy stares and the brooding manner in which they carry themselves, observers may not immediately relate the two races. Whereas cloud giants wear their finely made robes and ornate jewelry with an air of regality and serenity, their oni imitators manage to make even the humblest garments and adornments seem ostentatious, and are always shrouded in an air of darkness that many liken to an ill omen. Though wind yai look as though they have one foot in the light of day and the other in the darkness of night, the shadow that perpetually swirls about the otherworldly beings is not the result of any natural source; in actuality, the supernatural night that constantly follows wind yai is a raw magical manifestation of their foul intentions and evil nature.

Wind yai do not shape the winds-they force their will upon them, commanding the powers of the sky to commit acts of domineering brutality with none of the natural grace normally associated with the element. Whereas a cloud giant is always accompanied by a gentle breeze, the malicious wind yai brings with it only furious storms, the chaotic winds tossing its hair about and blowing dust into its unblinking triad of eyes.

A wind yai is 20 feet tall and weighs over 5,000 pounds.
