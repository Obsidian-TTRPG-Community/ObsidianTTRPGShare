# Description
The largest of all known jellyfish, whaler jellyfish are able to rapidly paralyze and kill prey as large as whales-hence their name. This deep blue creature’s pale bell can sometimes be mistaken for a bank of fog when viewed from afar as it drifts on the surface of the sea, lying in wait patiently for its next meal.
