# Description
Believed to be native to the Parapet Mountains, wollipeds were among the first beasts of burden domesticated by Triaxians. Some claim wollipeds werenâ€™t domesticated initially to be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. In any case, Triaxians have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds.
