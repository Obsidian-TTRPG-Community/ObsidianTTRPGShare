special_abilities:
  - name: Blind (Ex)
    desc: A wamp lacks eyes and “sees” exclusively through its blindsight ability, which is based on a combination of sound, body heat, and the natural growth and decay of matter. It is considered blind beyond 60 feet. It is invulnerable to all sight-based attacks and effects, including gaze attacks.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    desc: A wamp’s bite attack infects those it damages with disease. For most wamps, this is a virulent form of zombie rot, but in some cases, a wamp can inflict foes with other undeath-related contagions, such as ghoul fever.

 Zombie Rot: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 round; frequency 12 hours; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Any creature that dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Feign Undeath (Ex)
    desc: Although the wamp is a living creature, it registers as an undead creature for the purposes of the spell detect undead. As a swift action, a wamp can attempt to trick an undead creature into thinking the wamp is itself undead-to do so, it attempts a Disguise check opposed by the target undead creature’s Perception check. A successful Disguise check allows the wamp to maintain the facade against that undead creature for 24 hours before being forced to make a new check. This ability lets the wamp move relatively unhindered among unintelligent undead, but intelligent undead who understand the threat a wamp presents are unlikely to be fooled by this deception for long. This ability does not allow the wamp to be healed by negative energy; it is harmed by such attacks (and healed by positive energy) as per normal for a living creature. It does grant the wamp a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks and effects generated by undead creatures, regardless of whether its trickery has worked on that particular undead creature.
  - name: Swift Infection (Su)
    desc: All diseases a wamp inflicts on creatures have no onset time, and those who are infected with such a disease must attempt saving throws to avoid its effects twice as frequently as normal for that disease.

desc_short: This crimson-footed, nine-legged monstrosity has an egg-shaped body covered in dirty white fur. Its eyeless face, piglike snout, and toothy maw make for a disturbing visage.

# Description
Wamps dwell in the dead cities of the Dreamlands, particularly within necropolises or undead-haunted graveyards, where they can hunt their favored prey-unliving creatures with decaying flesh-with ease. A wamp is a vaguely arachnid creature, albeit one with nine legs that end in webbed feet colored a brilliant red, as if the creature had just finished wading through a pool of fresh gore. The wamp’s face combines the least attractive features of a pig and a bat, but without the eyes. Covered with bristly pale fur save for their crimson feet, wamps often invite comparison to blood-smeared bones due to their coloration. Wamps often chuckle and chortle as they draw near their prey, eschewing ambush tactics in favor of a more disturbing opening volley of mockery designed to let their victims know that they have been marked for death-yet wamps are not foolish. Against canny foes, wamps can be as silent as the grave before springing to the attack.

A wamp’s body is 4 feet in diameter, but its 3-foot-long limbs give it a gangly leg span of 8 feet. It weighs 300 pounds and typically carries with it the faint and unsettling stench of rotting flesh.
