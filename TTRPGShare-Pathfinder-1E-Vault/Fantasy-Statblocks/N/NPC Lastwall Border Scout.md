tactics:
  - name: During Combat
    desc: While scouting at night, a Lastwall border scout is sure to imbibe her potion of darkvision and stay close to her allies. In combat, she uses her bow to strike down foes from a great distance, taking to melee only as a last resort. Smokesticks allow the rangers to send signals to one another while split up, and alchemist’s fire ensures that they can make short work of any trolls or other nasty foes they encounter.
  - name: Morale
    desc: If pressed by a force they cannot hope to defeat alone, Lastwall border scouts do their best to evade and lose any enemies following them before returning to Castle Everstand or another nearby Lastwall border fort.

# Description
Travelers roaming the plains between Lastwall and Belkzen may accidentally encounter scouts from Everstand sent to watch the borderlands, though such border rangers are masters of stealth and are rarely seen unless they wish to be.
