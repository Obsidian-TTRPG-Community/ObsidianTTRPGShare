# Description
Holy warriors are divinely sanctified and anointed warriors, raining death with bow and blade upon the forces of darkness and bringing hope and rescue to the desperate. Holy warriors are versatile combatants and could be masters of a temple or monastery. A holy warrior might command ten temple guards (as guards, CR 9), while a pair of holy warriors might escort a priest (CR 10). A half dozen could be a saint’s honor guard (CR 13).
