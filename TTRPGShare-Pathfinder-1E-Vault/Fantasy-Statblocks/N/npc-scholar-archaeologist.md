# Description
An archaeologist is a cunning scholar and explorer of ancient texts and ruins. She is knowledgeable in a wide range of fields, as quick with a quip or quotation as with a blade, bolt, or lash. An archaeologist might partner with a medium to placate the spirits of the dead disturbed in her explorations (CR 7), or supply a traveling merchant with exotic relics (CR 8).
