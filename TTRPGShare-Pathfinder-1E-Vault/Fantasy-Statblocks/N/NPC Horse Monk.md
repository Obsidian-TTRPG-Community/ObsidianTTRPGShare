  - name: During Combat
    desc: The monk prefers to fight from horseback, and uses Ride-By Attack and Lunge to hit foes so he faces little risk of retaliation. He often uses Stunning Fist on the first pass, and if successful follows with a Spirited Charge. Against other mounted foes, he uses Improved Trip to unhorse his opponents if possible.
