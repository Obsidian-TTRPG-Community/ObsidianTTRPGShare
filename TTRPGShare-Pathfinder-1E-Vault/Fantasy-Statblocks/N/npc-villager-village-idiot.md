# Description
The village idiot is an amiable simpleton, eking out a meager existence through charity, begging, odd jobs, or occasionally bringing down small game with his sling. While usually a gentle soul, the village idiot is prone to anger if provoked, and may lash out blindly with whatever item is at hand.

Giving a village idiot the Skill Focus feat in place of Endurance creates an idiot savant, displaying great knowledge in one specific area, usually a Craft or Knowledge skill. Switching an idiot savantâ€™s Constitution and Charisma scores, and giving him Animal Affinity, Skill Focus (Handle Animal), and the Handle Animal skill instead of Climb, creates a horse whisperer or someone who relates better to animals than to humans (hp 4, Fort +0, Handle Animal +11). A village idiot might also carry a crude knife, or could have learned to defend himself from the taunts of cruel villagers with his fists (and the Improved Unarmed Strike feat).

Village idiots can also be used as prisoners, galley slaves, or incarcerated lunatics in an asylum. A village idiot can also represent any simple commoner, by replacing his Climb skill with an appropriate Craft or Profession skill. A stableboy might have the Ride skill instead, while a dock rat may possess the Swim skill. An urchin runner might have the Fleet and Run feats instead.

A village idiot is usually encountered alone, but may also be found tagging along with an acolyte, drunkard, farmer, or shopkeep.
