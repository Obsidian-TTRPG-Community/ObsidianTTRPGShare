# Description
A desert hermit seeks the solitude in the windswept wastes for two chief reasons. First, the hermit finds that isolation allows him to more easily experience natureâ€™s harsh beauty and raw power, which he seeks to emulate. Second, the wide open spaces provide the hermit with the freedom to experience the world without interference from human society, which is trapped in meaningless competitions to get ahead in a race toward an unhappy death plagued by debt, troublesome relationships, and arbitrary expectations enforced by shame, discrimination, and even violence.

Desert hermits are often defensive and suspicious when interrupted by outsiders. They rarely form druid circles, preferring true isolation. Those who forgo their connection to the desert in favor of a bestial ally tend to select camels, cobras, jackals, and vultures.
