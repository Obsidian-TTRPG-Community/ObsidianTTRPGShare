# Description
A shaman serves a small tribe as a visionary and source of wisdom-the sole authority on supernatural matters, and the only one who can communicate with the worlds beyond. His familiar may be a representation of his spirit animal or a spy who allows him to learn more about other tribesfolk and appear wiser than he is.

This stat block can also be used as a lesser adept apprenticed to an initiate (adept 3), doom prophet (adept 4), or guru (adept 6).
