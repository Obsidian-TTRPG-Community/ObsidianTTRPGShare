# Description
The average pirate is a free-spirited renegade who would have great difficulty surviving in the cultured depths of polite, civilized society. Rogues and fighters typically make up the majority of a pirate ship’s crew of sailors, as they possess both the skill and brawn necessary for day-to-day raids and heists. These colorful, adventurous characters chafe at society’s laws and restrictions, and the exciting life of the buccaneer is well suited to pirates’ ferocious independence.
