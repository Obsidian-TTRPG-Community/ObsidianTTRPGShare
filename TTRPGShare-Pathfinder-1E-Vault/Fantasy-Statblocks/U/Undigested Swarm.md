An affected creature can make a new save as a full-round action. Washing off the acid grants a +4 bonus on this save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Whereas individual undigested are more of a nuisance than a threat to adventurers, a swarm of such creatures can be dangerous to even experienced adventurers. An undigested swarm comprises hundreds of individual undigested. Driven by insatiable hunger, they fall upon and consume any living creatures crossing their path, surrounding the unfortunate victims and drenching them in acidic slime, digesting their still-living prey even before the screaming ends.
