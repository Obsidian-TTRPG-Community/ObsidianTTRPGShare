special_abilities:
  - name: Freezing Mist Breath (Su)
    desc: A frost drake can, as a standard action, spit a ball of liquid that bursts into a cloud of freezing mist. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 7d6 points of cold damage (DC 18 Reflex half) to all creatures in a 20-foot-radius spread. The mist cakes all surfaces in the area with a sheet of slippery ice that turns the area into difficult terrain for 2d4 rounds, after which the ice cracks or melts enough to revert to the normal terrain features in the area. Once a frost drake has used its freezing mist breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    desc: This ability works like spider climb, but the surfaces the drake climbs must be icy. It can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    desc: Three times per day as a swift action, a frost drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.
  - name: Snow Vision (Ex)
    desc: A frost drake can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

desc_short: This two-legged dragon has dull blue scales tinged with bright blue ice. A freezing mist issues from between its powerful jaws.

# Description
Degenerate cousins of white dragons, frost dragons are ferocious predators. They are larger than other drakes, reaching heights of up to 16 feet and weighing upward of 2,500 pounds. Their wide, clawed feet enable them to easily burrow through snow, though not through dirt or clay. 

Young frost drakes form adolescent hunting packs divided along gender lines, but older frost drakes are usually encountered in mated pairs. Frost drakes mate for life, leaving their packs when they find a suitable mate. Mated pairs make a nest together, and the female lays a clutch of two to five eggs. Both parents care for their offspring when they hatch, and families usually form small packs until the young reach maturity at 5 years of age. At this point, the parents abandon their offspring, usually laying a new clutch of eggs in a new nest elsewhere, and leaving the fledgling drakes to find their own adolescent packs to join.
