# Description
Despite their name, fire salamanders have nothing to do with the evil outsiders known as salamanders. These are Diminutive poisonous amphibians that can live more than 50 years. They are most active after dusk, eating earthworms, insects, slugs, and spiders. During the day, they hide amid fallen leaves or near mossy tree trunks.

 Fire salamanders are 6 to 10 inches long and weigh only 2 ounces.
