special_abilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    desc: A faceless hulk can assume the form of a Large humanoid at will but requires 10 uninterrupted minutes to alter its body. Performing this transformation is somewhat painful, but the faceless hulk can maintain its new shape indefinitely once it has achieved that form. It can change back to its true form as a swift action, and it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 round after it does so. A faceless hulk retains its own innate abilities when it assumes its new form and does not gain any of the abilities of the creature it mimics. A faceless hulk gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks when using this ability.
  - name: Explosive Expansion (Su)
    desc: In its natural form, a faceless hulk can expand rapidly as a full-round action. It grows one size category larger, pushing back any creature or object in its new space. The faceless hulk can choose which direction (or directions) it expands from its original space, and it can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver check against any creatures in these squares of sizes Large or smaller. The faceless hulk uses its increased size (usually Huge) to determine its Combat Maneuver Bonus for these checks. At the end of its turn, it immediately returns to its original size, though it can choose which squares it occupies when it does so. This ability does not change the faceless hulk’s weight.
  - name: Faceless (Su)
    desc: In its natural form, a faceless hulk has no discernible facial features. It gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist attacks or effects that target the senses. This includes gaze attacks, odor-based attacks, sonic attacks, and similar attacks. This bonus does not apply to illusions.

# Description
Ugoroths are monstrous, sadistic beings created by aboleths in their long war against the surface world. Alongside their smaller cousins, the faceless stalkers (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 122), they work to destabilize surface-dwelling civilizations from within. During the war, the destruction of the aboleth city Voshgurvaghol left them leaderless and without direction. Though they have long forgotten the beings that created them, faceless hulks continue their original mission, driven only by a hatred for humanity that was molded into their very bodies. Some believe that ugoroths still serve their veiled masters, even without their own knowledge.

Faceless hulks range in height from 10 to 14 feet and weigh anywhere from 1,200 to 1,700 pounds.
