special_abilities:
  - name: Confusion (Su)
    desc: A creature struck in combat by a temerdaemon’s melee attacks must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be confused for 1 round. The durations from multiple strikes and failed saving throws stack. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Reaper’s Curse (Su)
    desc: Creatures within 30 feet of a temerdaemon are afflicted by a profound increase in self-inflicted and allyinflicted wounds, failures in magic, and similar accidental damage. Arcane spell failure chances from armor are doubled. A creature that rolls a natural 1 on its attack roll automatically rerolls the attack against itself or an ally (50% chance of either). A creature that rolls a natural 1 on its roll to cast defensively suffers a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps on page 491 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Skill checks that have consequences if failed by 5 or more (such as Climb, Disable Device, and Swim) have these consequences on all failed checks

# Description
Temerdaemons exist to personify accidental death. A knight falls onto her sword; a peasant trips and breaks his neck; a structure fails in ways its builders never foresaw and buries dozens of innocents- and a temerdaemon cackles knowingly in the distance. While true accidents please the fiend, it also delights in engineering incomprehensibly complex plots that lead to the slaughter of as many mortals as possible. A temerdaemon often wades into the aftermath of such catastrophes, carving apart survivors and sowing mass confusion and hysteria. 

Temerdaemons only rarely cooperate among themselves, but a trio of them sometimes forms a “trapper gang” to pursue common goals. 

A gangly mass consisting of a rotund torso, four arms, and four legs, a temerdaemon is 10 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds, not counting its often bizarre collection of odd mechanical fetishes and other tinkering equipment.
