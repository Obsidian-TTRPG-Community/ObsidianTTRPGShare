# Description
While all daemons represent death in some fashion, thanadaemons, the Deacons of Death, represent the inevitable death through old age. Thanadaemons effortlessly work eerie skiffs along every pus- and bile-choked river in Abaddon, including the legendary River Styx. For the right price (typically 50 pp or 2 gems worth at least 300 gp each), a thanadaemon will even carry passengers on its skiff, yet those who travel with these fiends should beware-they frequently renegotiate the terms once they’ve got their passengers in dangerous realms.
