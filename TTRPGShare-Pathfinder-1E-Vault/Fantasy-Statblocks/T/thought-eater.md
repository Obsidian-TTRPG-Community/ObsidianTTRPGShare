special_abilities:
  - name: Eat Thoughts (Su)
    desc: A living and corporeal creature that takes damage from a thought eater’s bite loses some of its thoughts, as the thought eater drains them to nourish itself. If the victim is a spellcaster, she loses a single spell prepared, or a single unused spell slot (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster) of 1st level or higher. A spellcaster chooses which spell or spell slot she loses from this ability. If the victim is not a spellcaster or has no prepared spells or unused spell slots of 1st-level or higher, on a failed saving throw this ability instead deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (victim’s choice). When a creatures loses a spell slot or takes ability damage from this ability, the thought eater gains 1 PE (up to a maximum of its total daily PE; 5 for most thought eaters).
  - name: Ethereal Body (Su)
    desc: A thought eater’s skin and organs are composed primarily of ethereal tissue. The thought eater takes half damage from nonmagical weapons, but is affected normally by magic weapons and spells. For every minute the thought eater remains on a plane other than the Ethereal Plane, it must spend 1 PE or take 1d6 points of damage as its body begins to dissipate.
  - name: Ethereal Passage (Sp)
    desc: A thought eater can move from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a move action, and can move from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane as a full-round action. Moving from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane costs the thought eater 1 PE, although moving from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane does not. Both forms of movement provoke attacks of opportunity.

# Description
These tiny predators of thought live almost their entire lives on the Ethereal Plane. They are so tied to that place that without its energy, a thought eater’s psychic power begins to deplete, until finally the very fabric of its own personal reality breaks down and it fades out of existence. But while the Ethereal Plane is necessary for thought eaters’ continued existence, its vastness and relative lack of prey force thought eaters to sometimes hunt on the Material Plane. Such trips are often gluttonous affairs, as the thought eaters must not only gain sustenance, but also gain enough nourishment to stave off their rapid psychic and physical decay in that hostile environment.

 Normally, thought eaters are fairly single-minded, but the inherent danger in their forays to the Material Plane makes them eager for easy meals. Someone who takes the time to provide consistent easy meals for a thought eater can expect the creature to follow her on the Ethereal Plane, watching for its next feeding time. Given that every minute on the Material Plane is strenuous for a thought eater, such a person is unlikely to receive much conversation from the creature trailing her, but if something threatens the safety of its food source, the thought eater may be moved to protect its companion. In this case, the thought eater uses its daze monster ability to help the person escape and may even be motivated to cast resist energy on her. If this bizarre and alien friendship continues for long enough, the thought eater may even choose to assist in identifying magic items-when properly compensated, of course.
