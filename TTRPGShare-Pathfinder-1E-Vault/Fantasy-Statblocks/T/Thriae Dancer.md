special_abilities:
  - name: Inspiring Dance (Su)
    desc: Three times per day as a standard action, a thriae dancer can consume a dose of merope and dance to create one of three effects. The thriae dancer may maintain her dance as a free action, and the effects persist as long as the thriae performs her dance. A thriae dancer can dance for a number of rounds equal to her Hit Dice before becoming fatigued. After that, if she continues dancing for that same number of rounds, she becomes exhausted. A thriae dancer may switch between performances as a swift action. All dances have a range of 60 feet. This is a mind-affecting effect.
 Dance of Fervor: All non-thriae are affected by confusion and rage (Will DC 17 negates). When this effect ends, affected creatures are fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the time they were affected and are immune to that thriae dancer’s dance of fervor effect for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
 Dance of Grace: All thriae gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. This bonus increases to +2 if three or more thriae dancers are performing a dance of grace within range.
 Dance of Passion: All thriae gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 if three or more thriae dancers are performing a dance of passion within range.
