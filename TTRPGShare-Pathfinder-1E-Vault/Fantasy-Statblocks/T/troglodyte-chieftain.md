# Description
Most ferocious troglodyte chieftains earn their positions by killing and eating their predecessors. Almost all chieftains practice some form of divine magic, and they must be strong-and cruel-to reign over their fractious, savage tribes. Troglodyte chieftains often wear fine metal items claimed from other creatures that they or their subjects have killed.
