# Description
Erastil’s herald is rarely seen more than once in a given generation, and only when a settlement is in mortal danger. All good creatures of the forest recognize its near-divinity and come when they hear its bugling call. Other than its mighty summons, it does not speak to humanoids. It stands 60 feet tall and weighs approximately 140 tons.
