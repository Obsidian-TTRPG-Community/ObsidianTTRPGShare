special_abilities:
  - name: Painful Bite (Ex)
    desc: Living creatures damaged by a bore worm are racked with panic-inducing pain, gaining the frightened condition (Fortitude DC 15 negates) for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vulnerable to Water (Ex)
    desc: Water is lethal to bore worms, which shrivel when exposed to either fresh or salt water. Bore worms take half again as much damage (+50%) from spells and abilities with the water descriptor, and take a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells and abilities with the water descriptor that do not deal hit point damage.

A single, finger-length bore worm has never been much of a threat to any one creature, but isolated bore worms are found only in laboratories. Bore worm swarms, as they are more commonly encountered, consume organic material with a voracious appetite, tunneling through the earth like water as they reach progressively larger sizes.
