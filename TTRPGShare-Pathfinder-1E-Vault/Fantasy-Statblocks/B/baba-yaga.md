gear:
  - name: gear
    desc: amulet of natural armor +5, apple of eternal sleep, Baba Yaga’s besom (see page 62), belt of mighty constitution +6, bracelet of second chances, cackling hag’s blouse, corset of dire witchcraft, ebony fly figurine of wondrous power, gem of seeing, Grandmother’s basket (as a portable hole), Grandmother’s shawl (as a cloak of resistance +5), grim lantern, hat of disguise, haunted shoes, headband of alluring charisma +6, hexing doll, orb of foul Abaddon, pearl of power (5th level), ring of elemental command (fire), ring of freedom of movement (slotless), ring of protection +5; in addition to the gear listed here, Baba Yaga has access to a wide variety of other magic items that she can use at the GM’s discretion.
special_abilities:
  - name: Contingency
    desc: Whenever Baba Yaga is attacked, she is affected by mislead.
  - name: Exceptional Stats (Ex)
    desc: Baba Yaga was born a perfect specimen of humanity. As a result, her ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than using the standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs. Additionally, Baba Yaga has much more gear than an NPC of her level would normally have. These modifications increase her total CR by 2.
  - name: Forceful Presence (Ex)
    desc: Baba Yaga adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to her Armor Class and on all of her saving throws. In addition, Baba Yaga uses her Charisma score as well as her Constitution score when calculating hit points. This ability increases her total CR by 1.
  - name: Hut Familiar (Ex)
    desc: Baba Yaga built her Dancing Hut using a combination of the witch’s hut hex and the sanctum mythic path ability, and over time expanded the artifact’s powers to its present state. The Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga serves as Baba Yaga’s familiar, and replaces the normal witch’s familiar ability. Baba Yaga’s life is forever intertwined with her Dancing Hut and parts of her essence reside within it. As long as the hut exists, this special connection grants her 300 bonus hit points, DR 10/epic and good, and regeneration 20. This ability increases her total CR by 1.
  - name: Immortal (Su)
    desc: Baba Yaga has hidden her death to make herself even more difficult to kill. This functions as the base mythic ability (Mythic Adventures 13), but Baba Yaga always returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of how she is killed. In order to permanently kill Baba Yaga, her death must be found and released back into her body, at which point she can be killed with a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact.
  - name: Long-Lived (Ex)
    desc: Mystical arcane powers, mythic abilities, and complex arcane rituals have extended Baba Yaga’s life. She gains the +3 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores for having lived beyond venerable age, but she doesn’t gain the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution resulting from this advanced age. Baba Yaga’s supernaturally empowered life grants her complete immunity to ability damage and drain, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, energy drain, petrification, poison, and all forms of madness (including confusion effects and feeblemind). This ability increases her total CR by 1.
  - name: Permanent Spells
    desc: Through the use of permanency, Baba Yaga is constantly under the effect of the following spells: arcane sight, darkvision, read magic, see invisibility, and tongues. Baba Yaga has also devised a way to inscribe symbol spells upon her person. Baba Yaga has permanent symbols of death (DC 36) magically inscribed on the center of her chest, between her shoulder blades, upon the crown of her head, and on the soles of her feet. Only a few great beings have knowledge of the symbols’ passwords (each symbol has its own unique phrase), and even fewer significant personalities have been attuned to the symbols.
  - name: Queen of Witches (Ex)
    desc: As Queen of Witches, Baba Yaga knows all witch spells, as well as all sorcerer/wizard spells. Baba Yaga also has knowledge of many other spells that she has researched. Many of these are arcane versions of divine spells. In addition, Baba Yaga can create artifacts, and has done so to great extent, the greatest of which is the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga.

# Description
Around campfires and in front of hearths on cold winter nights, wise grandmothers and favored uncles recite countless tales of a stern and powerful woman. Some know her as the Old Crone, others as Old Knobby Legs. She’s often called the Queen of the Witches, but those who are wise call her Dear Grandmother. She is Baba Yaga, and on Golarion, she has an oppressive and violent legacy. But, on other worlds, the foolhardy and the brave seek her for wisdom and magic.
