  - name: Attach (Ex)
    desc: When a breathless orchid hits with a slam attack, its sinewy leaves latch onto the target. An attached breathless orchid is effectively grappling its prey. The orchid loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 10, but holds on with great tenacity-it has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached breathless orchid can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself; if its prey succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check against it, the orchid is removed.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    desc: Since a breathless orchid looks like a normal flowering plant when at rest, an onlooker must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.
  - name: Extract Air (Su)
    desc: A breathless orchid that begins its turn attached to a living creature that breathes gains fast healing 2 as it feeds off the air in its victim’s blood and lungs. This rapidly impacts the creature’s ability to breathe. At the end of the orchid’s turn, if it is attached, its victim must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 3 rounds while it gasps for breath (although this does not interfere with the creature’s ability to speak). Following these rounds, if the orchid is still attached, the creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude throw or fall unconscious. At the end of the following round, if the orchid is still attached, the creature drops to -1 hit point and is dying. At the end of the following round, the creature dies if the orchid is still attached.

# Description
Breathless orchids are beautiful but predatory plants that feed off the oxygen present in the blood and lungs of breathing creatures. Sometimes, breathless orchids live atop other plants, slowly leeching the oxygen they produce. However, these plants prefer to accost air-breathing creatures, as they find such beings’ oxygen much more enriching, and thus the orchids absorb air from them far more quickly. These plants’ brilliant colors serve to lure unsuspecting creatures within striking distance, and also indicate how well the plants have recently fed. Breathless orchids that boast the brightest and most beautiful colors have surely gorged themselves recently on the dying gasps of several creatures.
