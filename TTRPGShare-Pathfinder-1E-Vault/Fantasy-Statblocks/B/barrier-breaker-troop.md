special_abilities:
  - name: Overwhelm (Ex)
    desc: A barrier breaker troop deals 3d6 points of damage with its troop attack to foes in its space.
  - name: Trench Mist Symbiosis (Ex)
    desc: A barrier breaker troop is immune to trench mists' (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5 250) acid damage. When a barrier breaker troop reaches 0 hit points and is destroyed, it bursts violently outwards, and creatures within or adjacent to the troop take 4d6 points of acid damage. If any section of this troop is engulfed by trench mist when this death burst occurs, the trench mist's fast healing ability doubles for 2d6 rounds.
  - name: Vandalism (Ex)
    desc: A barrier breaker troop ignores the first 5 points of hardness when attacking doors, walls, and other barriers. In addition, it deals double its troop damage (normally 4d6) against such barriers and unattended objects. When a barrier is destroyed with this ability, it explodes and deals an amount of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage equal to 1d4 points plus 1 point per point of the object's hardness to creatures within 5 feet of the object, including the barrier breaker troop.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    desc: A barrier breaker troop can hurl a barrage of rocks and debris as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to two lines with a range of 40 feet. These lines can each start from any square the troop occupies. Creatures in these lines take 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
