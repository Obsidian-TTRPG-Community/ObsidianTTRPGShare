special_abilities:
  - name: Bloodlust (Ex)
    desc: When a byakhee successfully bites a living creature, it is swiftly driven to a frenzied bloodlust. For 1 minute after it bites a target, it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against that target. A byakhee has no limit as to how many simultaneous bloodlust targets it can have at any one time, but it generally focuses on the same target once its bloodlust is engaged. It also gains these bonuses on attack and damage rolls against creatures taking bleed damage from any source.
  - name: Low Metabolism (Ex)
    desc: While a byakhee craves blood if it hasn’t fed within the last 24 hours, it doesn’t suffer any negative effects from starvation, and it can, in theory, survive forever without drinking or feeding. It is immune to effects that induce magical starvation or thirst, yet it still seeks to drink blood whenever it can to sate its desire. Its strange metabolism and body also render it immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, and other forms of precision damage.
  - name: Starflight (Su)
    desc: A byakhee can survive in the void of outer space, and it flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes it 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes it 3d20 years (or more, at the GM’s discretion)-provided the byakhee knows the way to its destination.
  - name: Yellow Sign Affinity (Ex)
    desc: A byakhee is immune to the effects of the Yellow Sign, and by concentrating, it can locate the nearest active Yellow Sign as per discern location (CL 20th). When an active Yellow Sign is visible, a byakhee gains fast healing 2 and a +4 enhancement bonus to its Dexterity. An active Yellow Sign is either one that was created by Hastur or by the Yellow Sign spell (see page 72). Inactive Yellow Signs, such as the unholy symbols carried by cultists of Hastur, do not bolster a byakhee, but these creatures generally treat those who openly wear such symbols as allies. A character who displays a Yellow Sign in this manner gains a +5 circumstance bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against a byakhee.

# Description
Byakhees are a race of interstellar aberrations that hail from the distant and alien city of Carcosa, where they serve Hastur. Vaguely humanoid in shape, their bodies combine elements of the forms of carrion birds, insects, and mammals, giving an outward appearance that, while horrific, might at first glance seem possible in the natural world. Yet, those who have studied dead byakhees know this to be a lie, for the creatures’ bodies hold bizarre organs and masses of unknown tissue that seem to serve no purpose; the further into a byakhee’s body one explores, the stranger its entrails become. The fact that portions of its body appear to be decaying or rotting away even as it lives only adds to the mystery of the creature’s peculiar anatomy.

A byakhee is 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.
