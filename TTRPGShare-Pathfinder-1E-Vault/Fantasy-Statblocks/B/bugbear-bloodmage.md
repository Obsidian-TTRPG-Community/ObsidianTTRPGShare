# Description
Arcane spellcasters among bugbears are typically sorcerers-few bugbears have enough interest or patience to follow arcane paths such as wizardry that require study or control. Bugbears call those with natural magical talent bloodmages, and treat their spellcasting ability the same as any skill-if it’s useful for hurting, it’s worth knowing. A typical bloodmage is interested in only spells that cause destruction and pain, plus a few supplemental spells to help her defend herself. Almost no bloodmages learn to create magic items.
