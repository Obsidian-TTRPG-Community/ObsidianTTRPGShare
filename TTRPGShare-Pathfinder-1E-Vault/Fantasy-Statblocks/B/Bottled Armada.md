    desc: Whenever a bottled armada fires its ballistae, swarms a creature, or is dealt weapon damage, one of the containing bottles shatters, spraying glass in a circle around it. All creatures in a 5-foot radius take 1d6 points of piercing damage. A successful DC 13 Reflex save (DC 13) halves the damage.

A ship in a bottle signifies patience and devotion. Parts are assembled through an obstinate hole to create the illusion of something impossible. The average model maker devotes months of delicate handling and blinding eyestrain to its creation. Most ships in bottles are built by sea captains and modeled after their vessels. As the devotion of a captain to his ship compares to that of a marriage, a ship in a bottle could be seen as the offspring of that relationship. This devotion is palpable well beyond the Material Plane.

Water sprites, tiny elemental spirits from the Plane of Water, see boats as perversions enabling landlubbersâ€™ insistence on venturing where they do not belong. These water spirits commandeer ships in bottles and sail them through the air to chase off the sailors who invade the high seas. Even if the ship in a bottle is destroyed, the water spirit at the helm claims victory, having effectively forced a captain to destroy his offspring.

A ship in a bottle is about 1 foot long and weighs about 5 pounds.
