    desc: A living creature injured by a botfly swarm’s attack must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be infested with the swarm’s larvae. The larvae may be cut out of the host with a DC 15 Heal check, though each attempt inflicts 1d8 points of damage whether or not it’s successful. A cure disease spell destroys all larvae without further harm to the host.

Botfly larvae: infestation; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage.

# Description
Common to sweltering jungles, warm swamplands, and lazy riverbanks, these pestilent f ly swarms seek humanoid hosts for their eggs. While not as physically dangerous as their giant cousins, implanted botf ly larvae typically carry diseases that spread to the host.
