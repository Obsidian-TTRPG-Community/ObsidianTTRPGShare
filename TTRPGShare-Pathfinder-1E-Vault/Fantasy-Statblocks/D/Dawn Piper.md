special_abilities:
  - name: Dissonance (Su)
    desc: Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a dawn piper can use a musical instrument to unleash a deadly torrent of sonic vibrations that tears at the very physicality of its enemies. This is similar to a breath weapon that deals 6d6 points of sonic damage in a 15-ft. cone (Reflex DC 16 half ). A dawn piper must be in possession of a musical instrument in order to use this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Elemental Font (Su)
    desc: A dawn piper can infuse a 40-foot-radius area with the primal qualities of the First World. The creation of an elemental font requires a musical instrument and a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. As long as the piper returns to it every 24 hours, a font can persist forever, but it is destroyed immediately upon the creator’s death. A dawn piper can also destroy its own font as a full-round action. The dawn piper gains additional spell-like abilities based on a single element while within range of its elemental font. Dimensional anchor and dimensional lock stop the flow of power, preventing the piper from using the additional spelllike abilities. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and the spell-like abilities are cast at caster level 7th.

Water: 2/day-aqueous orbAPG (DC 16), hydraulic pushAPG, slipstreamAPG
  - name: Terrible Beauty (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a dawn piper can surround itself in an intense aura of magnificence that is too potent for non-fey to withstand. Non-fey creatures within a 30-foot radius of the dawn piper must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be blinded or deafened for 1d4 rounds (the piper’s choice, but the effect is consistent for all affected creatures), and take 1 point of bleed damage from their eyes or ears (depending on the specific effect). This aura lasts 1 full round, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw cannot be affected again for 24 hours. This is a visual or auditory, mind-affecting effect. A dawn piper requires a musical instrument in order to create this aura. The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based.

desc_short: Eldritch energy burns within the eyes of this humanoid figure. Strangely colored hair crowns her head like a torch, and gleaming white teeth shine from her grin. The creature cradles a pipe in her long, graceful fingers.

# Description
Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are unmistakably humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of half-elves. But dawn pipers’ otherworldly nature becomes evident when one looks at the creatures’ eyes, which burn with a strange light. Their skin is smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and radiant. Their hair moves constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the breeze, and seems to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits of every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a dawn piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its expression become static and human-and through such songs, dawn pipers’ heartbreaking beauty becomes truly evident.
