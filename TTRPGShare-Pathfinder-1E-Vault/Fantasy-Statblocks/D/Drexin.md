# Description
This gremlin’s head and pointed ears are overlarge compared to the rest of its anatomy. Thin, often matted hair tops a drexin’s scalp. Its light-starved, wizened flesh stretches taut across its bones, and its claws brush the ground as it walks. An average drexin stands 3 feet tall and weighs 25 pounds.
