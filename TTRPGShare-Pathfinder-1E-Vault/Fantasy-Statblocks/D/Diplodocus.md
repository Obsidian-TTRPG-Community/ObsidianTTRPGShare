    desc: The diplodocus prefers to attack with its tail. The dinosaur can snap its incredibly long tail with surprising speed like an enormous whip-this is a primary attack that deals bludgeoning and slashing damage. A diplodocus can make two separate attacks with its tail lash as a full-attack action.

desc_short: This enormous, long-necked quadruped moves with an uncanny grace, holding its lengthy, whiplike tail out level behind it.

# Description
The diplodocus is one of the longest dinosaurs, capable of reaching lengths of 100 feet or more. Much of this length is taken up by the diplodocusâ€™s tremendously powerful whiplike tail, a devastating weapon capable of striking at a considerable range.
