  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    desc: A domovoi defends itself and its home through telekinesis. This ability functions as the spell telekinesis, usable at will, with a caster level equal to the domovoiâ€™s Hit Dice (CL 5 for most domovoi). A typical domovoi has a ranged attack roll of +5 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the ability on objects weighing up to 50 pounds. If a domovoi attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 14 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
The work never ends for those who live on farms or in small villages, and the wise often seek the aid of the fey folk while pursuing their daily chores. A family might leave a piece of bread under the stove or an old boot in the closet to attract a domovoi to their home. Domovoi help with small tasks like churning butter and mending clothes, but mostly protect the home from intruders and misfortune. These helpful fey can also tell the fate of the family they protect, but grow annoyed when asked to do so too often. A domovoi appears as small, old man no more than 2 feet tall, covered in hair and with a long, shaggy beard.
