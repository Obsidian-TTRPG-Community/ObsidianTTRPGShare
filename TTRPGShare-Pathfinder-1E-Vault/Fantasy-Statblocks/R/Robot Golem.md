special_abilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    desc: A robot golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage deals half damage to the golem. Additionally, for 1d4+1 rounds the golem gains the benefits of haste and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing an object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach; it then moves on to spread more destruction. The golem comes back under the control of its creator when the duration ends.A transmute metal to wood spell reduces the robot golemâ€™s damage reduction by 5 and its natural armor bonus by 9 for 1d4 rounds.A robot golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
  - name: Rend Construct (Ex)
    desc: This functions as the rend special ability, except the robot golem can rend only other constructs.
  - name: Shockwave (Ex)
    desc: A robot golem can release a pulse of electrical energy held within its nonfunctioning batteries as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This pulse is a 30-foot-radius spread that deals 8d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in its area of effect (Reflex DC 19 half). The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

desc_short: Though corroded and damaged, this bipedal metallic construct moves silently, as though powered by some force other than its own rattling gears.

# Description
When robots are damaged beyond the abilities of Numerian technologists to repair, salvages sometimes animate their frames via magic rather than science. What results is more of a walking mechanical corpse that lacks the intelligence and vulnerabilities of a true robot. The arcanists of the Technic League often employ these magically animated constructs to combat rogue robots or those under the control of their enemies.
