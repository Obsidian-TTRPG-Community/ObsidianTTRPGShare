# Description
Void dragons are a cursed race, born on the boundary between rational space and the vast unknowable nothingness that lurks between the stars. They are not typically evil, but few escape the notice of the unnamable beings that dwell within that distant void. The fortunate ones resist the fell influence of the Dark Tapestry and survive with their minds intact.

Raskineya was not one of the fortunate ones. The taint of the void shattered her mind, driving her to mindless violence and destruction. In her madness she sought out the inner planets of Golarion’s solar system, plunging into the gravity wells of the inhabited worlds to feed and raze before fleeing back to the stars and plotting her next attack.

This urge to destroy is what brought her to the attention of the cult of Rovagug. Priests of the Rough Beast often enslave powerful creatures to serve as proxies for their shackled god and guardians for their hidden temples, and Raskineya’s savagery and madness made her an excellent prospect. The priests called to the stars, whispering promises of blood to the dragon to lure her into their waiting clutches. In her unthinking madness, she was no match for the cunning priests, and soon she was subdued, shackled, and locked in a cavern hidden deep within the earth.

Raskineya languished at first, longing to once again fly to the stars and seek exotic new prey. Yet the priests had not lied to her when they promised her blood. She was given sacrifices and allowed to hunt and feed within her underground prison. With each such sacrifice, she not only grew stronger and more focused, but also found began to understand the prayers given to her. This world was promised to Rovagug, and he would have it. All worlds were promised to him, and he would destroy them all. Even the gods themselves would fall to his power, and in his wake only nothingness would remain. Raskineya found in Rovagug something she had not realized she was searching for: someone to champion. If she could but release this Unmaker, she could at long last have vengeance upon this existence, and upon the nameless ones who drew her here. All that would be left in his wake would be nothingness, and to nothingness her heart longed to return.

With her newfound sense of purpose, Raskineya turned upon her captors. Her mind intact for the first time in centuries, she quickly overpowered them. First, she swallowed the high priest alive, consuming his life and essence to fuel her ascension. Then she enslaved the priests, and commanded them to find her a way to unleash their god upon the world once more. From them she learned of a prophecy, set down by the oracles of the brimstone haruspex, that a dark comet would herald the return of Gormuz-the first and most powerful of Rovagug’s spawn-who would in turn unleash the Rough Beast himself. Raskineya sees herself as this dark comet, and demands all those who address her to call her by that name (with a slow death awaiting to those who do not).

In the years since her ascension, Raskineya first scoured the world searching for the Star Towers-artifacts created by the gods to strengthen Rovagug’s prison. The dragon was certain that if she could locate the first of these towers and destroy it, the rest will fall like dominoes, weakening the foundations of Rovagug’s prison enough to allow his escape. She moved from Star Tower to Star Tower, searching for clues as to the location of the original. She last conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, winning it from a paladin of Sarenrae named Dazma the Bright, who had learned of the dragon’s design on the tower and marshaled an army to defend it. Raskineya vanquished Dazma and her army by dragging meteors from the sky to drop on the Sarenites. Those who survived the initial bombardment were savaged by akatas carried within the meteors, leaving the remainder easy pickings for the dragon.

Though it seemed she was getting closer to her goal, Raskineya’s devotion to Rovagug made her actions unpredictable. Just as she conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, she heard a pressing call she believed came from Rovagug himself. She flew to the Pit of Gormuz, where she made a den in the Crater of Carnal Joining in anticipation of the Rough Beast’s arrival. There she waits, conducting horrific rituals to attract his attention. She brought with her the Sarenite survivors of the raid on the Star Tower, who she keeps alive as subjects for her rites. Once noble soldiers, they’re now maimed and driven mad, kept in perpetual darkness within a small cave in Raskineya’s lair. The warriors of the Maimed Legion, as she calls them, see light only when they’re being tortured.
