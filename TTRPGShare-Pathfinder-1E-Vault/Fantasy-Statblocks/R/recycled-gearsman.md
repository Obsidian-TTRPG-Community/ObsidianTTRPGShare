# Description
A skilled artificer can revitalize a ruined construct by jury-rigging the pieces left intact. The patchwork nature of a recycled construct renders it fragile and leaves key circuitry exposed.

 The sample recycled construct above uses a gearsman as the base creature. The sample recycled gearsman is treated as if it received one glitch during construction reducing its bonus hit points by 5.
