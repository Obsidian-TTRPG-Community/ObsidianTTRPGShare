special_abilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    desc: Most humanoids slain by a ragewight rise as cairn wights (though with chaotic evil alignments) in 1d4 rounds. However, humanoids with 6 or more Hit Dice and the rage class feature instead become ragewights, retaining the rage powers they had in life. Such spawn are under the command of their creator until its death, at which point they become free-willed undead.
  - name: Savage Fury (Ex)
    desc: A ragewight can trigger a savage fury as a free action. It can use this fury for 24 rounds each day. These rounds don’t need to be consecutive. The ragewight gains a +6 profane bonus to its Strength and Charisma and a +3 profane bonus on Will saves when using this fury. When a ragewight ends its fury, it is staggered for 1d4 rounds and can’t resume its fury during this time. This ability otherwise functions as the greater rage barbarian class feature, treating the ragewight’s racial Hit Dice as its barbarian level for the purposes of rage and any rage powers.

# Description
Ragewights are the spirits of savage warriors who died in a rage and have since had their burial places disturbed or robbed. They are most common near the necropolis of Nogortha, a vast graveyard that includes many barrows of barbarians slain in 1707 ar by the expansionist forces of Taldor. Grave robbers plundering such barrows occasionally unleash a ragewight, which immediately sets out to build an undead army of spawn and wage war against those who slew it centuries ago.
