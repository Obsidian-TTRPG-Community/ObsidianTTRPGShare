  - name: Acid (Ex)
    desc: A radiant essence secretes a corrosive substance that dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but doesn’t affect stone. Each time a creature takes damage from a radiant essence’s acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of acid damage (Reflex DC 25 negates damage to clothing and armor). A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a radiant essence takes 2d6 points of acid damage, unless the weapon’s wielder succeeds at a DC 25 Reflex save. If a radiant essence remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, the object takes 30 points of acid damage (no save). The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Divine Ectoplasm (Su)
    desc: A radiant essence’s attacks count as good-aligned for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction and deal an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. Evil creatures that hit a radiant essence with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take 2d6 points of damage.
  - name: Sense Evil (Su)
    desc: A radiant essence automatically knows whether a creature it detects with its blindsight has an evil alignment.

# Description
When a particularly powerful good-aligned outsider gives its life defending a holy location on the Material Plane, remnants of its pure spirit can be weighted down with worldly matter. Most good-aligned outsiders never contribute to a radiant essence, as their holy energy is drawn back to the good Outer Planes in death, but the most righteous and powerful among them might leave behind a bit of their zealous spirit that hungers to continue its crusade against evil. When the remnants of several such outsiders pool and coalesce into a combination of spiritual residue and holy energy, an energetic, shimmering sludge called a radiant essence emerges. Unintelligent but driven to destroy evil, radiant essences are an enigmatic force for goodness. Some servants of benevolent deities actively collect radiant essences from the Material Plane, using their protomatter in the creation of powerful celestial champions; but others allow these oozes to stay on the Material Plane as protectors of sacred areas. Alchemist-priests have long sought formulae to recreate these oozes but cannot replicate the process of their creation; devout scholars posit that the will of the divine prevents mortal creation of such holy matter.

 Like many oozes, radiant essences are comprised primarily of caustic matter, but this substance is infused with holy energy that causes them to shine with a soft, glowing light. Radiant essences sense their environment by vibration and air pressure, supplemented by their instinctive knowledge of whether nearby creatures are fundamentally wicked.

 A radiant essence is normally 8 feet in diameter and between 8 and 12 inches thick. It weighs approximately 1-1/2 tons.
