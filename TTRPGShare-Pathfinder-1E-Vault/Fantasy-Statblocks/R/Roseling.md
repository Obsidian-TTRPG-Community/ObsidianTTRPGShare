special_abilities:
  - name: Euphoria (Su)
    desc: A creature damaged by a roseling’s thorns must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become filled with joy for 1 hour, during which time the creature finds it difficult to take hostile actions. The creature takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls, cannot take attacks of opportunity, cannot ready an attack or any other action that would deal damage, and takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against other emotion effects. This is a mind-affecting emotion and poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Thorns (Su)
    desc: A roseling can launch a thorn as a standard action, or up to four thorns as a full-round action. A thorn has a range increment of 20 feet (to a maximum of 10 range increments) and deals piercing damage. A roseling applies its Dexterity modifier (+5 for the typical roseling) on the damage dealt by a thrown thorn instead of its Strength modifier. A creature damaged by a thorn is exposed to the roseling’s euphoria. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Roselings are often found in Shelyn’s divine realm. A roseling’s petal color reflects its personality: pink roselings are gentle, red roselings are passionate, white roselings are shy, yellow roselings are gregarious, and the rare blue roselings are transcendent and often more powerful than their kin, having class levels or the advanced creature template.
