A single creature can have no more than one royal gift from an impariut at a time. As long as the royal gift lasts, the impariut can sense the target’s position and general condition, as per status. The impariut can remove a royal gift as a free action, and a royal gift can be removed by dispel law. An impariut can only maintain one royal gift for every 4 Hit Dice it has (3 royal gifts for a standard impariut).

# Description
Monarchs, dictators, governors, and mayors may rule under the pretense of sustaining lawful civilization, yet those who abuse their power or harm their people undermine the foundation of government. To the forces of Axis, these bad actors represent a threat to cosmic order and a means by which the chaos of uprisings and revolution can take hold. The mortal agents of lawful deities are responsible for encouraging responsible governance; where they fail, an impariut must intervene.

 Each impariut is a stern counselor sent to reform a powerful leader, guiding that figure toward sustainable policies that maintain order. Unlike many inevitables that care only that the universal order is upheld, impariuts exhibit slightly more patience and flexibility, knowing that an iron-fisted response is as likely to trigger riots as a negligent regime. As a result, impariuts are capable diplomats and teachers, equally proficient with incentives as with unflinching punishments.

 An impariut stands precisely 7 feet tall and weighs exactly 350 pounds.
