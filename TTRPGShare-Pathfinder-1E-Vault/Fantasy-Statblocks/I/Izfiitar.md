special_abilities:
  - name: Greater Warpwave (Su)
    desc: A creature struck by an izfiitar’s bite or claw must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or be affected by a greater warpwave. Roll 1d20 and consult the following list for exact effects on the creature. The save DC is Constitution-based. d20 Warpwave Effect 1 Target takes 4 points of Strength damage. 2 Target takes 4 points of Dexterity damage. 3 Target takes 4 points of Constitution damage. 4 Target takes 4 points of Intelligence damage. 5 Target takes 4 points of Wisdom damage. 6 Target takes 4 points of Charisma damage. 7 Target gains 1d4 negative levels. 8 Target is blinded or deafened for 1d4+1 rounds. 9 Target is confused for 1d4 rounds, and all non-proteans that are within 20 feet are affected by confusion (Will DC 23 negates). 10 Target is struck by a fireball (Reflex DC 22 half) centered on its location that deals acid damage rather than fire. 11 Target is affected by greater dispel magic (CL 20th). 12 Target is sickened for 1d4+1 rounds. 13 Target is nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. 14 Target is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. 15 Target is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. 16 Target gains 8d6 temporary hit points. 17 Target is affected by a heal spell (CL 20th). 18 Target is permanently turned to stone. 19 Target is temporarily shifted outside of the normal flow of time, as per temporal stasis, for 1d3 rounds. 20 Target is affected by imprisonment (CL 20th), and a keketar protean loyal to the izfiitar appears in the target’s place.
  - name: Kiss of the Speakers (Ex)
    desc: Moment by moment, an izfiitar tinkers with the myriad possibilities in which it can act or move, granting it the prescience to choose whichever possible moment best suits it. As a move action once every other round, an izfiitar can grant itself one of the following options on its next round’s action: double all of its speeds for 1 round, gain the ability to roll one d20 roll twice in the next round and choose which result to use, or gain an additional standard action that can be used only to activate a spell-like ability.
  - name: Reshape Reality (Sp)
    desc: This ability functions as mirage arcana heightened to a 9th-level spell, except the changes created are quasi-real, like those created by shadow conjuration. A creature that interacts with reshaped reality can attempt a DC 26 Will save to see through the illusion. Terrain thus created can provide concealment, and against foes who fail the Will save to see through it, reshaped reality can provide cover. For disbelievers, quasi-real objects and terrain have only 20% of the normal hardness and hit points, and break DCs are 10 lower than normal. Damage caused by dangerous terrain can’t exceed 5d6 points of damage per round (1d6 per round against disbelievers). This ability can’t damage existing structures, nor does it function in areas where planar travel is prohibited.

# Description
While the keketar proteans (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 215) hold vague ideological sway over their kind’s infinite choruses, the izfiitars loom above them, cardinals among the slithering clergy. Aloof and distant even compared to the keketars, izfiitars rarely venture beyond the Maelstrom’s deepest reaches, content to divine the will of the plane’s unknowable dualistic godhead, the Speakers of the Depths. 

Bound to a single chorus, izfiitars are and yet are not distinct from the keketars who pay them obeisance, leading many to speculate that they are essentially elevated keketars, chosen for reasons unknown and propelled along a path of apotheosis either by the Maelstrom itself or by one of the so-called protean lords. Yet their position remains paradoxical, befitting the Maelstrom’s rejection of stability and consistency. Not every chorus contains an izfiitar, while some contain multiple, and the size and influence of any given chorus is entirely independent of their presence. 

Although smaller in size than keketars, izfiitars have monstrous physical attacks and stupendous magical powers. They wield a more powerful version of lesser proteans’ warpwave, as well as abilities that bend reality and alter probability, focused on the proteans’ desire to return all of reality to the freedom of pure, unbound chaos.
