# Description
Adult female ostriches average 6 feet tall and weigh about 220 pounds, with males averaging 7 to 9 feet and 250 pounds. Although they are likely to flee from predators when they can, ostriches are more than willing to stand and fight when trapped or defending their chicks; they’re known to kick even lions to death in defense of their young.

A trained ostrich has a market price of 80 gp, whereas an egg is worth 25 gp. Because it’s bipedal, an ostrich requires an exotic saddle.
