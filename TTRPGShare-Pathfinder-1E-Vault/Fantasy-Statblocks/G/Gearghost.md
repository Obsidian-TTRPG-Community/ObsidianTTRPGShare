special_abilities:
  - name: Create Trap (Su)
    desc: Once per week, a gearghost can create a trap of CR 4 or lower regardless of cost, materials, or skill checks. Two or more gearghosts working together on a trap can increase the maximum CR by 2 for each additional gearghost working in concert. For example, three gearghosts working together can create any CR 8 or lower trap in a week. Example traps can be found on page 420 of Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    desc: A destroyed gearghost reforms in 2d6 days. To permanently destroy a gearghost, holy water must be poured over its remains within the area of a hallow spell. To complete the destruction, every trap within 100 feet of the remains must be successfully disabled or destroyed before the gearghost is completely destroyed.
  - name: Resetter (Ex)
    desc: A gearghost can reset traps and keep them repaired with supernatural efficiency. A gearghost can reset a trap with a repair or manual reset as a move action. If a trap has an automatic reset that is longer than immediate, a gear ghost can reset that trap as a free action.

# Description
Formed from the unquiet soul of a thief wrenched from life by a wicked trap, a gearghost delights in rigging up the same threats and tortures to which it succumbed. Eager to witness the deaths of others, the gearghost prowls the place of its death, constantly maintaining and resetting any traps in that area as it waits for victims to fall into its clutches. A gearghost also has the ability to create and set new traps, and as such its lair is usually choked with perilous new snares, spikes, and pits. A gearghost only keeps treasure as a lure for hapless adventurers, often using such treasure as the trigger for one of its devious creations.
