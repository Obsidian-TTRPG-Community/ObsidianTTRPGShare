special_abilities:
  - name: Ice Spikes (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a gammenore can force freezing water through pores in its carapace to produce long, sharp spikes of ice. These spikes impale nearby creatures, dealing 6d6 points of piercing damage to each creature adjacent to the gammenore (Reflex DC 19 half). Additionally, the spikes shatter easily, embedding shards of ice in the flesh of creatures that fail their saving throws against the attack-these shards deal 1d6 points of bleed damage each round until the wounds are healed. A gammenore can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Oversized Pincer (Ex)
    desc: A gammenore’s pincer attack is a primary attack that deals the indicated amount of damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.
  - name: Shell of Ice (Su)
    desc: Much of a gammenore’s carapace is encased in a thick layer of jagged icicles. This shell of ice functions much like spiked armor, dealing 1d8 points of piercing damage to the target of any successful grapple combat maneuver check made by the gammenore.

 Additionally, this frozen shell helps to regulate the gammenore’s cold body temperature, granting it resistance 10 to fire. The shell can absorb up to 60 points of fire damage before melting. Once the shell melts, the gammenore takes a -4 penalty to its natural armor bonus, it loses its fire resistance, and it deals no additional damage when grappling. A gammenore can reconstitute a melted shell by spending time in areas of intense cold. This process takes 2 hours in a cold environment, 3d10 minutes in areas of severe cold, and 1d10 minutes in areas of extreme cold.

    desc: 84
desc_short: Spikes of ice jut from the carapace of this stocky crustacean. It scuttles sideways on its eight legs with surprising speed, while its two pincers-one small and sharp, the other monstrously large-flex in anticipation of combat.

# Description
The gammenore is a prime example of how Triaxian fauna has adapted to survive the planet’s long, cruel winters. While other creatures struggle to survive the planet’s decades-long season of cold and ice, the gammenore thrives, turning the might of winter into the very tools of its survival.

Absent its icy armor, the gammenore looks like a large, blue-and-white-shelled crustacean. It has a rather wide, oval-shaped carapace, a pair of powerful pincers, and four pairs of strong, articulated legs.

A gammenore’s two pincers serve very different purposes. The primary claw is monstrously large and extremely strong, and is used to break through ice and crush the gammenore’s prey. The other claw is smaller, less cumbersome, and sharp enough to rend flesh and bone. The gammenore uses this smaller claw to tear its victims into pieces small enough to eat, and to perform any manipulations too delicate for the large claw. Its eyes are located on short stalks that rise from the front of its carapace, allowing it to see even when encased in its shell of ice. A gammenore is approximately 8 feet wide, and weighs between 2,000 and 3,000 pounds.
