special_abilities:
  - name: Overwhelm (Su)
    desc: A gishvit can transfer the information within its pages to a single target through its grasping ribbon. When a gishvit has successfully grappled a foe, it can force this information directly into the grabbed creature’s mind, overwhelming it with an onslaught of facts and recorded information. The grappled creature must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ribbon (Ex)
    desc: A gishvit’s tongue is a primary attack with reach of 10 feet. A gishvit applies its Dexterity modifier as a bonus on attack rolls with its bookmark ribbon. A gishvit’s ribbon deals no damage on a hit, but it can be used to grab the target. A gishvit has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe grabbed by its ribbon. A gishvit does not gain the grappled condition while using its ribbon in this manner.
  - name: Transcription (Su)
    desc: A gishvit finds pleasure in being a repository of information. It can immediately transcribe information dictated to it and material it overhears. Alternately, a gishvit can spend an hour with a willing subject, wherein it collects memories and experiences from the subject. This transcription process is not dangerous to either the gishvit or the target.
Information recorded and stored in this manner appears as filled pages within the gishvit’s booklike body, and it remains there for up to 24 hours after the gishvit is slain (unless the gishvit was killed by an erase spell, see below). Another creature can research the pages of a willing or deceased gishvit. The text inside a gishvit is comprehensible to any creature that can read and knows at least one written language. Researching the information within a gishvit for 1 hour grants the reader a +4 insight bonus on any single Knowledge check in the next 24 hours, and the reader can attempt such checks even if not trained in that Knowledge skill.
  - name: Vulnerability to Erase (Su)
    desc: An erase spell deals 2d4 points of damage to a gishvit and has a 50% chance of removing all written text within its pages (no save). A gishvit reduced to 0 hit points or below in this manner is slain, becoming a blank book.

# Description
Sometimes referred to as “lore roaches” by scholars familiar with the Outer Planes, gishvits are natural inhabitants of the lawful plane of Axis. Often associated with the native axiomites and scrivenites, gishvits occupy a mundane role on Axis, maintaining vast stores of knowledge within their booklike bodies. Transcribing knowledge from living creatures, a gishvit stores information in its body in the form of written text, preserving the acquired knowledge within itself. Because of this unique method of information gathering, gishvits are treasured by information brokers and spellcasters on the Material Plane.

 A gishvit varies between 1 to 2 feet in length, often weighing no more than 8 pounds.
