special_abilities:
  - name: Blood Gorger (Ex)
    desc: A geomaw dedicates much of its energy to digesting prey it has captured, and loses its burrow speed while digesting a creature using its swallow whole ability.
  - name: Blood Lantern (Su)
    desc: As a swift action in any round it inflicts damage to a victim it has swallowed whole, a geomaw can emit a scintillating pattern of red-hued light from its crystalline interior. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or be fascinated. This is a sight-based, mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same geomaw’s blood lantern for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Freeze (Ex)
    desc: While lying motionless with its mouth open, a geomaw appears to be a natural crystal formation. A geomaw that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a natural cave feature.
  - name: Powerful Bite (Ex)
    desc: A geomaw applies twice its Strength bonus to bite damage.

# Description
Birthed from the unfathomable terrors of the cavernous deep, geomaws roam the Darklands, finding easy prey among the covetous races of Nar-Voth and Golarion’s surface. Their hulking bodies can extend up to 15 feet long and weigh between 2,000 and 4,000 pounds. Despite their great size, geomaws require little sustenance, and can go weeks or even months between meals. They pause for days or weeks on end, remaining perfectly motionless as they wait for prey. This creature’s open maw resembles a cache of valuable crystals, ripe for the plucking. Curious beasts and greedy prospectors alike flock to these shining gemstones-attracted by the subtle shimmering light they radiate and the faint, sweet scent the geomaw exudes-only to be quickly gobbled up.

These strange aberrations reproduce rarely, gathering in great numbers in the wet, hot underground chambers that surround volcanoes. Geomaws lay caches of eggs that take three years to hatch. The mineral-laden waters of these caverns are vital to the formation of a young geomaw’s stony hide and gemlike teeth.

Geomaws have little society of their own and seem content to traverse the outskirts of wilder civilizations, feeding on the blood and flesh of unwary creatures that seek shelter or riches in the caves near the surface. On the rare occasion one cares to communicate, it does so through a series of tail thumps and clinks produced by tapping its crystalline teeth together. Mating groups of geomaws sometimes produce hauntingly beautiful sounds in such a manner.
