    desc: When a ghalzarokh misses with a melee attack against a creature, that creature suffers a -1 penalty to AC for 1 round. Whenever a creature succeeds at a saving throw against a ghalzarokh’s spell-like abilities or breath weapon, that creature suffers a -1 penalty on saving throws for 1 round. These penalties can stack up to three times per target, so a creature can take up to a -3 penalty to AC and a -3 penalty on saving throws. At the end of a creature’s turn, it can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw to reduce one of these penalties by 1 as a free action. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Ghalzarokhs, or tyranny demons, act as commanders of Abyssal forces. These demons are formed from the souls of petty tyrants and would-be dictators. Notoriously egotistical and prone to lashing out, a ghalzarokh keeps its minions in line through fear of its cruel whims.
