special_abilities:
  - name: Adaptive Learning (Ex)
    desc: A gearsman has a number of skill points equal to 4 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die, and treats Craft and Profession as class skills. In addition, a gearsman has a number of bonus skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice that can be reprogrammed to apply to any one skill-these ranks can’t be split among multiple skills and must apply to one skill. A gearsman can change what skill these bonus ranks apply to up to once per day by concentrating for 1 minute, during which time it can take no other actions. Rather than spend these bonus ranks on a skill, a gearsman can choose to devote them to weapon knowledge, gaining proficiency with a single weapon instead of bonus ranks in a skill. All gearsmen are automatically proficient with all simple weapons.
  - name: Charge Weapon (Ex)
    desc: Any metal weapon wielded by a gearsman becomes charged with electricity and deals 1d6 additional points of electricity damage on a hit.
  - name: Nanite Repair (Ex)
    desc: A gearsman’s nanites heal it, restoring a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice every hour (4 hit points per hour for most gearsmen). Once per day, as a full-round action, a gearsman can heal itself or any robot it touches of 4d6 points of damage.

# Description
For reasons known only to themselves, gearsmen willingly serve as shock troops and guards, performing their tasks with mechanical detachment and coldly logical efficiency. Yet they serve a purpose beyond their current directives- an objective installed in them when they were first created. Gearsmen disobey their putative masters whenever an order contradicts these mysterious internal directives. When questioned about their lapses, gearsmen answer with only silence.

 Despite their construction, gearsmen move fluidly. Their lack of a functional mouth doesn’t prevent them from talking, though most speak rarely. When they do talk, they speak with shrill, oddly distorted speech devoid of emotion and nuance, and their voices are all eerily alike.
