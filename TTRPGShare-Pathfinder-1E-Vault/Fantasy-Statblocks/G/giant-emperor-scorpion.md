    desc: A giant emperor scorpion can spend 1 minute digging itself into the soil or other ground debris. It then waits for its tremorsense to detect prey. When a creature comes within range, it can erupt from the ground as a free action as part of a charge, allowing it to use its pounce ability. When dug in, the scorpion has improved cover granting it a +10 bonus on Stealth checks.
