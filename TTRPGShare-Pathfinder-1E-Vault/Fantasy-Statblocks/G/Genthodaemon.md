special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Destruction (Su)
    desc: A genthodaemon can create an aura of pure carnage. All critical threats made against targets within the aura (including the genthodaemon) are automatically confirmed. Dying creatures within the aura take a -10 penalty on stabilization checks. The genthodaemon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.
  - name: Barbed Defense (Su)
    desc: A creature that strikes a genthodaemon with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d4+4 points of piercing damage from the barbed wire and other pieces of jagged metal embedded in the genthodaemon’s body. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger their users in this way.
  - name: Penetrating Slivers (Ex)
    desc: When a genthodaemon confirms a critical hit with a claw attack, pieces of its metal nails break off and enter the target’s body, working their way toward its heart. When the slivers reach the heart 1d3 rounds later, the creature takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. The slivers are destroyed by anything that removes curses, diseases, or death effects. Likewise, creatures immune to curses, diseases, and death effects are immune to this ability.
  - name: Shrapnel (Ex)
    desc: A genthodaemon can shake loose four large pieces of the shrapnel embedded in its body as a standard action (make a separate attack roll for each piece). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets of this attack must be within 30 feet of each other. The daemon can launch at most 24 pieces of shrapnel in any 24-hour period.

# Description
Genthodaemons are common troops of daemonic armies, resolutely obedient to any greater type of daemon that gives them orders. They personify death in hopeless or futile wars, genocide, and the despair created by long, bloody stalemates where the combatants lose their will to live and forget why they were fighting in the first place. They have almost no role in corrupting mortals, as they are devoid of interest in the fates of most other creatures, but are sometimes called by daemonologists or greater daemons for use in war or their ability to shape battlefields. Any daemon that can summon a ceustodaemon can instead use its summon ability to summon a genthodaemon. 

A genthodaemon looks like a stereotypical fiend- basically humanoid, but with claws, a tail, batlike wings, and cloven hooves. Metal armored plates, barbs, and spikes cover its body, though these are part of the daemon rather than armor it wears. Its claws are jagged metal shards sprouting from its fingers where nails should be. 

Genthodaemons are only slightly above cacodaemons and lacridaemons in the hierarchy of Abaddon. A greater daemon may create a genthodaemon from a cacodaemon or one of the hunted (a dead soul trying to survive on Abaddon); however, most arise naturally from war-battered souls who band together as hunted, transforming into true daemons simultaneously when the group has cannibalized enough souls. Genthodaemons show unusual loyalty to others in their band, though this doesn’t interfere with their obligations to more powerful daemons. 

A typical genthodaemon stands over 9 feet tall and weighs 500 to 600 pounds (with much of this weight stemming from the daemon’s embedded metal).
