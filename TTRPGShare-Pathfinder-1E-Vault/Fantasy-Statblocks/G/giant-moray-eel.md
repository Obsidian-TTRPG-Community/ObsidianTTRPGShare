    desc: If a giant moray begins a round with a grabbed foe, it inflicts automatic bite damage (2d6+9 points of damage). A giant moray eel possesses a second set of jaws in its throat that aid in swallowing-it can make a second bite attack (+11 attack, 1d6+3) against a foe it has already grabbed.

# Description
The moray eel is a ferocious predator, capable of holding prey in its primary jaws while a smaller set of jaws inside its throat chews away bite-sized portions.
