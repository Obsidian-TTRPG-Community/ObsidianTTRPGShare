special_abilities:
  - name: Dimension Slide (Su)
    desc: A valharut can teleport up to its speed as a move action, provided it has line of sight to its destination. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A valharut can perform this ability as a full-round action to teleport up to double its speed and make one melee attack against a creature at the end of this move.
  - name: Inviolate Aura (Su)
    desc: A valharut radiates an aura of inviolate form, granting all allies within 60 feet a bonus to Fortitude saves to resist hostile transmutation effects (such as a protean’s warpwave) equal to the valharut’s Charisma bonus (+5 for the typical valharut).
  - name: Valharut Hook (Ex)
    desc: Valharuts fight with an exotic weapon that consists of two hooked blades projecting from opposite ends of a shaft. A valharut hook is functionally identical to an orc double axe, but proficiency with the orc double axe does not grant proficiency with a valharut hook, or vice versa.

# Description
Valharut inevitables are champions in Axis’s ongoing war with the Maelstrom and its protean natives. Unlike other inevitables, the valharut is not designed to protect or maintain a specific universal constant or planar law, but rather to act as a soldier against the ever-encroaching forces of chaos. As such, valharuts are more often seen outside of Axis, battling enemies of law under the direct orders of their axiomite superiors.
