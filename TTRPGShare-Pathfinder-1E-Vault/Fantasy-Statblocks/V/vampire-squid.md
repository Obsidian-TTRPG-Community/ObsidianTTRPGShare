# Description
The vampire squid-so called for its red eyes and cloak-like webbing-is a cephalopod from the lightless depths of the oceans. This eerie mollusk is covered in photophores, which it can use to create a defensive barrage of light when agitated.

 A vampire squid can reach a total body length of up to 1 foot and weighs 1 pound.
