# Description
Vishkanyas are a race of exotic humanoids known for their guile and affinity for poisons of all kinds. A vishkanya’s flesh is made up of fine scales that from a distance of even a few feet look just like particularly smooth skin. These scales are usually a single dark color, although some of them have complex patterns like stripes or even spirals. A vishkanya’s tongue is forked like a serpent’s tongue, and its eyes lack visible pupils.

Although legends abound that the merest touch from a vishkanya can slay a mortal humanoid, these tales are patently false. A vishkanya’s skin is no more poisonous than that of any human, but it is true that their blood, spit, and other bodily fluids can be dangerous. Vishkanyas are skilled in using their own spittle or even their blood to envenom their weapons, and those who fight them should be wary of exposure to the vishkanya’s poison. A vishkanya is 6 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.
