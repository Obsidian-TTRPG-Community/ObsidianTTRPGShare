special_abilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds, a vavakia can breathe out a 60-foot cone of green fire that seems to writhe and coil with the tortured shapes of a thousand screaming ghosts. This green fire comprises countless souls the vavakia has consumed, and these vomited souls consume flesh as surely as they consume sanity. A creature struck by this breath weapon takes 20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 30 half) as the raw profane power blackens and melts its flesh and skin. Evil creatures take half damage from the breath weapon, but good creatures that take any damage from a vavakia’s breath weapon are automatically staggered for 1 round by the excruciating sensation. In addition, any living creature that takes damage from a vavakia’s breath weapon must also succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of Wisdom drain as its sanity slips away into madness. Immediately after the vavakia expels this green soulfire, the wailing flames flow in reverse into the demon’s gullet through its open maw. This restores 1d8 hit points to the vavakia for each creature that was damaged by its breath weapon. The Wisdom drain element of this breath weapon is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Smoking Wound (Su)
    desc: The wounds caused by a vavakia’s fangs result in terrible, eerie wounds that constantly weep wisps of green smoke rather than blood, a grim manifestation of the demon’s effect on a mortal soul. Each time a vavakia bites a creature, it inflicts 2 negative levels. The wounds continue to smoke as long as the victim suffers those negative levels, causing the victim to become sickened from the hideous sensation and rank smell of the vapors. An effect that removes this sickened condition without restoring the negative levels only temporarily causes the wounds to stop smoking-they begin smoking again in 1d6 rounds. Nonliving creatures bitten by a vavakia are immune to its energy-draining bite and do not exhibit smoking wounds. The Fortitude save to remove these negative levels is DC 25. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    desc: A creature struck by a vavakia’s tail slap must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. On a critical hit, the stun effect lasts for 1d4 rounds on a failed save and 1 round on a successful save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Vavakias are immense demons of great power. Saurian in shape, appetite, and destructive power, they are most often encountered on the Material Plane, though not as demons conjured by spellcasters to serve, but rather as violent invaders come to the world through tears in reality or portals to the deeper rifts. On the Material Plane, a single vavakia is a formidable presence, for the strange demon is driven to feed on living souls and spread destruction- roles at which it excels. 

A vavakia demon measures 30 feet in length and stands 15 feet tall, weighing in at 6,000 pounds. Vavakias form on the Abyss from particularly cruel mortal souls who, in life, practiced the vile act of extracting, enslaving, and even consuming other souls. When such a sinful creature arrives on the Abyss, it brings with it partially absorbed fragments of souls from its victims, which it incorporates during its horrific transformation into one of the Abyss’s most dangerous forms of demonic life. 

The creation of the first vavakias in this manner came at the hands of the demon queen Lamashtu, who was unsatisfied with the raw physical might and monstrous shape of her earliest demonic minions. In those early days, before she had become a deity, Lamashtu was already quite interested in the method by which the Abyss transformed the souls of sinful mortals into demons. When she learned that this process had first been triggered by the daemons, she was at once intrigued and enraged-intrigued because she knew that anything the Horsemen of the Apocalypse could do, she could do, and enraged at the idea that she owed her very existence to the curiosity of a daemonic lord. Though Lamashtu herself rose from the Abyss spontaneously, shortly after the daemons first “taught” the Abyss how to process sinful souls, that difference meant little to the Mother of Monsters. Fueled by rage, she waged war against Abaddon for many years and captured two Horsemen of the Apocalypse- predecessors of those who hold those titles now. She murdered one of them and forced from the other the secret method of manipulating the Abyss and its souls before murdering him as well. Both murdered Horsemen were soon replaced on Abaddon, but by that point Lamashtu’s wrath had been spent and all that remained was her own curiosity. 

Most of Lamashtu’s earliest attempts to create demonic life were hideous failures, but Lamashtu found joy and delight even in these failures. It wasn’t until the demon used her own body as an incubator to shape and then eventually birth the first vavakias that she found real success. Lamashtu’s early work in creating and manipulating the Abyss in this manner may have much to do with her resulting rise in power to the position of queen of demons-had not her escalating war with Pazuzu forced her attentions away from this hideous art form, there’s no telling what other strange demonic races she might have birthed upon the world. Now that she is a true goddess, Lamashtu’s interests expand far beyond the curiosities of the Abyss, and she has little time or desire to wallow in her home plane’s fecund properties. Of course, other demon lords throughout the Abyss are eager to learn these secrets, but to date, none have managed to duplicate Lamashtu’s feats of creation. 

In any event, the vavakias themselves have proven a phenomenal success and are among the Abyss’s most dangerous demonic races today-and since the creation of the first of their kind, the Abyss itself seems eager to spawn more and more of these deadly demons. 

Though originally created to serve as living weapons of war, the vavakias have long since established their own presence as Abyssal warlords and conquerors. While some pledge their service to powerful demon lords, most vavakias rule small empires of their own in the Abyss, typically in remote corners infested with jungles, swamps, and other primeval terrains.
