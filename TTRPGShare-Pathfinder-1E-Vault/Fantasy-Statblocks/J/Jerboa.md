# Description
Jerboas are desert rodents that live in burrows and hop around on long, thin legs. At night, they emerge from their burrows to eat plants and hunt insects under the light of the moon. Jerboas generally live to be around 6 years old.

A jerboa is 6 inches long, has a 1-foot-long tail, and weighs between 1 and 3 ounces.
