# Description
The fact that these sharks dwell in shallow coastal waters places them in direct contact with those making a living from the sea. Itâ€™s not uncommon to hear stories of jigsaw sharks leaping from the water and taking out dockworkers or fishermen in small boats. Their patchwork coloration of browns and blue-grays partly inspires their name.
