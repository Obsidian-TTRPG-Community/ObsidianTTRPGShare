special_abilities:
  - name: Destructive Blades (Su)
    desc: A hishandura’s melee attacks ignore hardness of less than 20 and damage reduction, except for damage reduction bypassed by epic weapons and damage reduction without a type (such as DR 10/-). Whenever a hishandura makes a full attack against an object or a structure, its attacks deal double damage.
  - name: Punitive Penance (Su)
    desc: When a hishandura rends a target, that creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or experience overwhelming grief for its past actions, as per terrible remorse. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Repentant Rain (Su)
    desc: Once per round after confirming a critical hit with a melee weapon, a hishandura can spray gore from the wound in a 30-foot cone originating from any square occupied by its target. Each non-asura in the area is blinded for 1d3 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 26 Reflex save. A blinded creature can wipe the gore from its eyes as a standard action, removing the blindness; alternatively, another creature adjacent to a blinded creature can wipe away the gore as a standard action. Jumping into a body of water or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as create water or hydraulic push) also removes the blindness. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Scent of Carnage (Ex)
    desc: A hishandura’s sense of smell is especially sensitive to blood and fresh injuries. The asura gains blindsense with a range of 60 feet but can sense only corpses, badly wounded creatures (those with half their total hit points or fewer), those suffering from bleed damage, and those affected by the asura’s repentant rain ability.
  - name: Smoke Sight (Ex)
    desc: A hishandura can see through fire, fog, and smoke as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of its vision.

# Description
Ages ago, a short-sighted god sought to punish his flock for a perceived slight, infusing a champion with a fragment of his power and sending it to wreak havoc. The champion did as commanded, tearing apart the faithful and showering their city with blood. The deity heard the tearful cries of the mortals, pleading for mercy and insisting that any kindly god would never visit such hatred upon his people. The god felt an upwelling of shame for having engineered such violence, but rather than accept responsibility or undo the damage, the god appeared before the city and forsook the divine champion, insisting that it was a raving beast sent by some less caring patron than himself. Empowered by their lying god’s words and magic, the people praised him, rallied, and killed the champion. From this act of betrayal-and the remains of the slaughtered champion-rose the first hishandura.

 Hishanduras are 13 feet tall and weigh 1,800 pounds.
