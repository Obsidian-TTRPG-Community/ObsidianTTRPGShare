special_abilities:
  - name: Beacon (Su)
    desc: Once per day as an immediate action, a hydraggon can emit a telepathic warning of danger to all hydraggons in a 100-mile radius. A qlippoth that receives this warning during or just before an initiative check gains a +4 bonus on that check.
  - name: Bite (Ex)
    desc: A hydraggon cannot make a bite attack during a round in which it uses its tongue to attack (either with weapons or as a secondary tongue attack).
  - name: Cloud Memory (Su)
    desc: When a hydraggon hits a creature with its tongue or bite attack, the target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have its memories clouded for 1d6 rounds (the creature takes a -3 penalty on this save if it was bitten instead of being struck by a tongue). During this time, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks, and it cannot use thought components when casting psychic spells. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    desc: A creature that succumbs to a hydraggon’s horrific appearance becomes distracted by the monster’s slithering coils and undulating tongues, and takes a -4 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attacks for 1d6 rounds.
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    desc: A hydraggon’s strange tongue splits into three tentacles, each of which is capable of feats of manipulation equal to that of a human hand. A hydraggon can wield weapons in these tongues, but if it wields more than one weapon, it must fight as if using the two-weapon fighting option. Although most hydraggons opt to wield a one-handed weapon and a light weapon, some choose instead to wield a two-handed weapon and a one-handed or light weapon- doing so uses all three of its tongues and doesn’t leave one free to make a tongue attack. When a hydraggon wields a two-handed weapon in this manner, it takes a -4 penalty on attacks with the two-handed weapon and a -8 penalty on attacks with its “off-hand” weapon. If a hydraggon has a free tongue, it can use it to make a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage and clouds a victim’s memory (see above).

# Description
The hydraggon is a strange qlippoth that has mastered the use of weapons, despite its lack of hands. These creatures enjoy swimming in the waters of the River Styx, and their immunity to mind-affecting effects shields them from the river’s memory draining properties. 

A hydraggon is 7 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.
