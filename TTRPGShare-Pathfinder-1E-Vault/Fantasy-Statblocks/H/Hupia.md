special_abilities:
  - name: Charisma Drain (Su)
    desc: A creature struck by a hupia’s slam attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Charisma drain. A creature already suffering a fear effect instead takes 1d4 points of Charisma drain on a failed save, or 1 point of Charisma drain on a successful save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    desc: A hupia can detect a creature with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition within 100 feet as if it had blindsight.
  - name: Misdirected Appearance (Su)
    desc: The first time a creature sees a hupia, instead of a frightening undead monster it sees either the form the hupia had in life or that of someone dear to the creature. An observer can see past this illusion with a successful DC 18 Will save. A creature immune to mind-affecting effects or that has other protections against creatures reading its mind is immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    desc: After being destroyed, a hupia reforms at the site of its death in 1d6 days. To permanently destroy a hupia, a special ritual must be performed involving a personal item of the hupia and 100 gp worth of rare herbs that are burned during the ceremony.

# Description
Hupias are drawn to their past lives by a yearning to live again. In trying to return to their previous lives, they seek to fool friends and loved ones with tales of how they were away traveling for a long time or were busy with something else and forgot to tell everyone that they’d be gone. The ruse rarely holds up, and once the loved ones discover the truth, the results are tragic at best. Most hupias are unable to work themselves back into the life they had due to their indistinct memories and lack of understanding that they are actually dead. 

Even though they don’t need to eat, many hupias still ingest the foods they loved when they were living. They seek out their favorites, even wandering into villages in order to procure them. Many hupias from tropical regions, where they are most plentiful, still love the taste of tropical fruits, specifically guava. 

Some groups of hupias form their own communities. These small settlements are typically secluded in deep jungles, well away from where they might be discovered, though they are often within a day’s walk from where many of the hupias resided in life. In these bizarre communities, hupias carry out mundane tasks in perpetuation of the semblance of a settlement, hoping they appear normal to outsiders who might happen by
