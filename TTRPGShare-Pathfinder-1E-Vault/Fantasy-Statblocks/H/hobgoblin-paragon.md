# Description
Many hobgoblin paragons join specialized teams of fellow hobgoblins within larger armies, though they live isolated lives, apart from their regimented kin, rather than feeling a true camaraderie. A large number of them instead travel the world, participating in tournaments of martial skill, from gladiatorial arenas to competitions in distant monasteries practicing foreign techniques. Others pursue more mercenary endeavors, selling their talents to the highest bidder so long as their contract involves dishing out pain to the weak or the unworthy. Whether as lone bodyguards of corrupt merchants or politicians, or high-ranking enforcers of the criminal underworld, a hobgoblin paragon willing to serve a well-paying master has no trouble finding employment wherever she might seek it.
