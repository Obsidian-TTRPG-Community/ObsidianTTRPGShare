    desc: Tumor Infestation: Injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con and 1d2 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who dies from tumor infestation turns into a hungry flesh 1d4 hours later. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Monstrous Growth (Ex)
    desc: A hungry flesh gains growth points from its reactive regeneration ability or from eating creatures. When it consumes a creature that’s been dead no more than an hour, it gains 1 growth point if that creature is of its size or one size category smaller, or 2 growth points if its meal is larger than it is. Eating a creature takes a fullround action if it is the same size or smaller than the hungry flesh or 1 minute if it is larger. Each time a hungry flesh reaches 5 growth points, it gains the giant creature simple template. This template stacks with itself each time the hungry flesh gains another 5 growth points, but the hungry flesh can’t increase its size beyond Gargantuan. When it stops gaining growth points, a hungry flesh loses a single application of the giant creature simple template for each hour that passes.
  - name: Reactive Regeneration (Ex)
    desc: Whenever a hungry flesh takes piercing or slashing damage, it regenerates 5 hit points and gains 1 growth point.
  - name: Slime Trail (Ex)
    desc: A hungry flesh leaves behind a trail of slime that acts as a grease spell (DC 17). Any living creature that touches this slime with bare flesh must succeed at a Fortitude save (with a +4 bonus) or contract tumor infestation. The slime dries up after 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Created in a laboratory by an alchemist researching methods of regenerating human flesh, a hungry flesh is a freakish creature made of aggressive, malignant tissue. It lives only to feed and grow, and must consume large amounts of plant and animal matter to sustain itself. Each day, a hungry flesh must consume its own weight in food. A hungry flesh resists attempts to cut or pierce it, quickly repairing the damage and creating new fleshy growths. With the right food and attacks to catalyze its growth, a hungry flesh can balloon to twice its normal size in minutes. A hungry flesh can grow to Gargantuan size.

A hungry flesh starts out at approximately 7 feet in diameter, and weighs 3,000 pounds.
