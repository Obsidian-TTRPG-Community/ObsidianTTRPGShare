    desc: As a standard action, a hollow one can cause all creatures within 30 feet to become shaken for 1 minute. On a successful DC 19 Will save, affected creatures are instead shaken for 1 round. This effect doesn’t cause a shaken creature to become frightened or a frightened creature to become panicked. This is a mind-affecting fear effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Rage (Su)
    desc: As a free action after taking damage in combat, a hollow one can fly into a rage. While raging, the hollow one gains a +2 bonus to Strength and 30 temporary hit points, but takes a -2 penalty to AC. The rage lasts until the end of the battle or for 1 minute, whichever is shorter. A hollow one can voluntarily end this rage at any point.

desc_short: The faint chemical smell lingering on this creature’s skin hints that it is not simply a normal person. Small, almost imperceptible flaws suggest that the creature’s skin is somehow stretched over an invisible frame.

# Description
Hollow ones are complex creations designed to fulfill a variety of purposes, most often acting as servants, guardians, or assistants. Each hollow one is bound by a physical similarity to a certain humanoid, who sacrifices a portion of himself in the formation process.

Unlike many constructs, however, the hollow one has a spark of intelligent life-the essence of its creator or the creator’s victim. While this enlivening energy is little more than a shallow imitation of the original’s true being, sometimes the hollow one can become more than an automaton and seek out its own life and motivations. These hollow ones are the most dangerous because they are most prone to madness (especially violent madness). Such a hollow one is the exception to the rule, however, and most are destined to become little more than slaves and playthings, obedient mockeries of those they were created to look like.

When encountered, hollow ones are often mistaken for undead creatures instead of constructs, mainly due to the unconventional building material required to create these creatures.

A hollow one is the same size as the humanoid it was fashion to resemble, but weighs a mere fraction of his weight due to being only chemically treated skin.
