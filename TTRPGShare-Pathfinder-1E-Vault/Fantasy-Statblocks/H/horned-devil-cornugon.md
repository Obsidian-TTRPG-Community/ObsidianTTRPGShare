special_abilities:
  - name: Infernal Wound (Su)
    desc: The damage a horned devil deals with its tail causes persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to staunch-a DC 26 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects.
  - name: Stun (Su)
    desc: Whenever a horned devil hits with a spiked chain attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This ability is a function of the horned devil, not of the spiked chain. The save DC is Strength-based.

# Description
Among the deadliest of the archdevilsâ€™ warriors and able commanders of lesser fiends, horned devils spread the rule of Hell wherever they tread. These greater devils are trained, forged, and reforged to be among the most lethal, merciless, and obedient warriors in the multiverse. While rank-and-file horned devils are called cornugons, the greatest of their kind are known as malebranche.

A typical horned devil rises to a hulking 9 feet tall, bears 14-foot-wide wings, and weighs 700 pounds.
