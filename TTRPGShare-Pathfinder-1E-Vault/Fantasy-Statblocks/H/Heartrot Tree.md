special_abilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    desc: Unlike other diseases, heartrot disease is particularly insidious due to having an immediate effect in addition to a lasting effect.

 Heartrot Disease: Slam-contact; save Fort DC 25; onset immediate; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds, then 1/day for 10 days; initial effect 1d2 Wis damage and nauseated; secondary effect 1d3 Con drain; cure 3 consecutive saves.
  - name: Hardy Stump (Ex)
    desc: A heartrot tree is difficult to kill. After it sustains fatal damage, a heartrot tree begins to regenerate and can grow back to its previous size in 1d4 weeks. Dealing 50 points of fire damage to the heartrot tree’s stump after it has sustained fatal damage prevents this regeneration.
  - name: Virulent Roots (Ex)
    desc: A heartrot tree’s roots grow deep beneath the surface. If the tree grows above a cave, cavern, or other large underground opening, its roots have the same statistics as the aboveground tree and can menace creatures underground in the same way. In this case, though they grow from the ceiling, treat a heartrot tree’s roots exactly as a normal heartrot tree. A heartrot tree can’t fight with its branches and roots simultaneously.

# Description
Disgusting products of blight or other magical plagues, heartrot trees represent nature warped to its most insidious. Heartrot trees typically lurk in the deepest depths of fouled forests; they are the manifestations of the very forces that poison the land. As a result, evil and disease pulse within heartrot trees, and the behemoths hunger to destroy anything good or natural still left around them.

 Heartrot trees are typically 30 feet tall from the base of their trunks to the tips of their tendril-like branches. When the trees grow above a cave or another large underground space, their roots are horrifically similar to their branches and dangle just as far from the ceiling. Heartrot trees’ trunks are typically 15 feet in circumference, and the plant’s entire mass weighs around 15 tons.
