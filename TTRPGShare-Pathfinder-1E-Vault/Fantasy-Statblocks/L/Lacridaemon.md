special_abilities:
  - name: Poisonous Tears (Su)
    desc: A lacridaemon’s tears are poisonous to other creatures. As a swift action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a lacridaemon can coat both of its claws with its tears, giving its next attack the possibility of poisoning its victim. In order to use this ability, a lacridaemon must attack with its claws on the same round it applies its tears; after that time, the tears lose their potency. A lacridaemon’s bite attack is always treated as having its poisonous tears applied to it. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

Lacridaemon Poison: Bite-injury; save Fortitude DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Wis damage plus staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Weeping Aura (Su)
    desc: A lacridaemon is surrounded by the muffled sounds of a crying child. These whimpers sound as if they’re coming from all directions at once, disorienting those within 100 feet of the lacridaemon. Any creature that enters this area must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or take a -5 penalty on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost for 24 hours. A lacridaemon can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action, and the effects from multiple lacridaemon auras stack (up to a maximum penalty of -20). This aura is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Among the least powerful of all daemons, lacridaemons personify death by neglect or exposure to the elements, such as that suffered by those who become lost in the wilderness and die far from help, or unfortunates who become trapped in an enclosed space (like a collapsed mine) and are left alone to slowly expire. Lacridaemons’ despair is in stark contrast to their savage nature. If they’re given any opportunity, they viciously lash out, furiously attacking their mortal victims. 

In death, lacridaemons continue to suffer just as their mortal incarnations did in their last days of life, consumed by feelings of abandonment, self-pity, and a gnawing sense of loneliness. They often spawn from the souls of evil mortals who died alone and abandoned-exiled criminals, reclusive and corrupt nobles, or those who died from intense exposure to the natural elements (whether the blistering heat of the desert or the ravaging cold of the arctic), such as by freezing to death or dying of thirst. 

A lacridaemon stands just under 6 feet tall but weighs only 90 pounds.
