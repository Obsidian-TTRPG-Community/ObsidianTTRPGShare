# Description
A hopeless, claustrophobic maze alone is enough to induce fear and despair, but the presence of a labyrinth guardian turns the situation into a nightmare. Relentless, ruthless, and almost unstoppable, these undead monstrosities have an unquenchable thirst for destruction. Dedicated servants of Baphomet or Lamashtu, labyrinth guardians rule their tiny, maze-like kingdoms with fearless power. Depraved minotaurs flock to their banner, hoping for protection and to appease whatever material or divine power the guardian serves.

In life, guardians stood vigil over catacombs, dungeons, or lost cities, and were unique not for their combat prowess, but rather for their endless devotion to their duty and foul gods. This loyalty, coupled with vile rituals whispered by their patrons, bound the guardians’ souls to the iron of their armor and resurrected them as twisted, ageless defenders. The same sense of commitment that enabled the guardians’ transformation also shackles them to their labyrinthine territories. This stunts the guardians’ dreams of expansion, limiting them to steadily adding on to their sprawling, confusing complexes. Over time, the legend of an ancient labyrinth guardian often exceeds that of the maze’s original treasure.
