  - name: Acid Spray (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a larval chuul can spray digestive fluids in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in this cone take 2d4 points of acid damage on the first round of exposure, and 1d4 points of acid damage on the second round. With a successful Reflex saving throw, a target halves the damage and negates the second round of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Long before the aboleths uplifted humanity, these deep-sea-dwelling entities experimented on other aquatic life forms, perfecting the art of genetic manipulation and developing entities that would become their unyielding servants. The creatures known as chuuls today (a derivation of their alghollthu name, “chu’ulothis”) were little more than aggressive crustaceans prior to aboleth meddling. Only after successive generations of guided evolution were chuuls transformed into the hulking monstrosities they are today, and their keen intelligence likewise came from their aboleth masters’ uplifting.
