  - name: Slime Strand (Ex)
    desc: A leopard slug can turn its mucus into a 30-foot-long strand, much like a spider’s silk. It can hang from this strand indefinitely and lower itself safely at a rate of 5 feet per round. It can climb back up the strand at the same rate. Once the slug breaks contact with the strand, the mucus disintegrates in 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    desc: A leopard slug secretes sticky mucus, which allows it to apply its climb speed to any surface, even sheer walls and ceilings. Once attached to a surface, it has no chance of falling off unless it’s grappled and actively peeled away.

# Description
Leopard slugs are distinctive due to their unique spotted coloration, which calls to mind the pelt of a leopard. This characteristic pattern allows leopard slugs to blend in with foliage and stones in the forest environments they call home. Occasionally, one can find more colorful varieties of leopard slug (such as bright yellow, flaming red, or fluorescent orange), bred specifically as pets or familiars by the esoteric masters who prefer such creatures. Although many find them disgusting, leopard slugs are completely harmless and award no XP if slain.

 Leopard slugs are about 6 inches long and weigh less than a pound.
