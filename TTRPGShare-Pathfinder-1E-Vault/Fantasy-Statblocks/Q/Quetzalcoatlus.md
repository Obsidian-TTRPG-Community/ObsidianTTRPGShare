# Description
The quetzalcoatlus is perhaps the largest of the pterosaurs, a category of flying reptile common in regions where dinosaurs dwell. Known to some as the “swamp stalker” and others by the misnomer “dragonling,” it is truly an awe-inspiring sight in the air, with an impressive 40-foot wingspan. On the ground, this creature’s profile bears an uncanny resemblance to that of a giraffe, save for the fact that the folded wings arch up to either side of its lightly feathered body and its head bears a horrific but brightly colored razor-sharp beak
