    desc: Three times per day, the Kallas Devil can cast its dire gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be staggered as a strange nebulous distress and a gnawing sense of impending doom plague the victim. If the Kallas Devil uses its evil eye on someone already afflicted by this curse, the victim must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be overwhelmed with fright and collapse into a comatose state for 3 days. Each day that passes, the comatose victim must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or perish. The evil eye is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based. 

Evil Eye Curse: Gaze-failed save; save Will DC 20; frequency 1/day; effect staggered (or fall comatose if already under the effects of the evil eye).

desc_short: Growing from the back of a horselike beast is the torso of a sea hag with grossly elongated arms and large, clawed hands. Its tangled web of stringy hair does not hide the disturbing fact that the hideous creature has no skin, and is built of gore and viscera.

# Description
This nuckelavee is even more hideous than usual because its torso is that of a sea hag, whose skinless head somehow retains a mess of hairlike knotted seaweed that flails behind it as the creature gallops furiously across the land. The creature dwells in Kallas Lake at the southern tip of the River Kingdoms and terrorizes the nearby town of Riverton, where humans and half-elves survive by fishing and guiding travelers along the branches of the Sellen. It mighty hooves also pound along the riverbank as far west as Tymon and as far east as the Creeperwood, bringing plague and death to those who despoil the waters. 

The influence of its hag torso drives the beast to want to clothe itself in skin. Other nuckelavees keep trophies of their kills, but the Kallas Devil flays its quarry to create a patchwork cloak of flesh that it drapes over its upper body. The husk of skin tears easily, so the devil requires a steady supply of victims to maintain its appearance. Some villages that suffer under its vengeance try to appease it by staking out criminals and other undesirables for its pleasure. The fey terror takes these sacrif ices but shows no favor to its supplicants.
