special_abilities:
  - name: Armor of Will (Su)
    desc: A kastamut’s powerful will generates a protective field of force that grants it an armor bonus equal to the kastamut’s Wisdom modifier.
  - name: Compulsive Orthodoxy (Su)
    desc: Once per week as a full-round action, a kastamut can place a geas-like curse upon a single target. If the target creature fails a DC 16 Will save, it must conform unerringly to specific cultural traditions or customs chosen by the kastamut. Each time the cursed creature fails to perform a customary ritual or tries to commit a prohibited act, it must attempt a new Will save at the same DC. If it fails, it is forced to conform to the culture’s accepted mores. If it succeeds, its actions are not restricted, but it immediately takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and gains the sickened condition until it resumes following the chosen customs. This curse remains in effect for 1 year or until the afflicted creature benefits from a break enchantment or remove curse spell (use the kastamut’s caster level for associated caster level checks). This is a mind-affecting, compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Discern Heritage (Su)
    desc: As a swift action, a kastamut can determine the cultural heritage of a single creature it can see. The kastamut learns the target’s racial background, clan affiliation, and any other pertinent information that can help it determine the customs and traditions most appropriate to that creature’s bloodline and upbringing. A target can resist this effect with a successful DC 16 Will saving throw. A creature that succeeds at the save cannot be affected by that kastamut’s discern heritage ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Slow and Steady (Ex)
    desc: A kastamut’s speed of 20 feet is never modified by armor or encumbrance.

# Description
Many know how the axiomites, entities of pure law who dwell in the Eternal City of Axis, forged the first and greatest of the inevitables-living constructs to wage war against the proteans and the unbridled chaos of the Maelstrom. Yet, even as the laws governing the multiverse have been altered over time, so too has the role of the inevitables changed. Beyond defending Axis’s borders, inevitables were tasked with seeking out threats to the order of all things. To fulfill these missions, the axiomites created many more types of inevitables. Among the lesser known are the kastamuts, charged with protecting the traditions of cultures spread across the Great Beyond.

 Like kolyaruts, kastamuts are humanoid in shape. However, kastamuts are shorter and stockier, giving the appearance of a dwarf-or an artistic impression of a dwarf-crafted in flowing curves and planes from dark bronze or gold-tinged steel. Unlike kolyaruts, kastamuts make no effort to disguise their identities when dealing with mortals. Depending on how long a kastamut has been in service, dents or cracks may mar its metallic shell, evidence of past battles against rebels and renegades.

 A typical kastamut stands about 5 feet tall and weighs approximately 250 pounds.
