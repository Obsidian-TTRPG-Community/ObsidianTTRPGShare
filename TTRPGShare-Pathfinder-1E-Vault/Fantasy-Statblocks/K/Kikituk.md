special_abilities:
  - name: Scrimshaw Magic (Sp, Su)
    desc: When a kikituk is created, its creator inscribes three spells-ones that require no costly material components-as scrimshaw designs. One of these spells must be 2nd level or lower, and the other two must be 4th level or lower. The kikituk can use these spells as spell-like abilities (CL 12th) at will (its Quicken Spell-like Ability feat applies to the spell that’s 2nd-level or lower). Erase removes one spell from a kikituk’s scrimshaw unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against the spell. If a kikituk’s scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to that spell as a spell-like ability. If all three spells are removed, it runs amok, slaughtering the nearest living creatures with reckless abandon-even its creator. As long as it has at least one scrimshaw spell in place, a kikituk gains a profane bonus to AC and on all saving throws equal to its Charisma modifier (+4 for the typical kikituk).
  - name: Shearing Jaws (Ex)
