special_abilities:
  - name: Eternal Fear (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a kimenhul can present itself in a terrifying manner to all creatures within 300 feet that can perceive it. Other sahkils are immune to this effect. All creatures within range must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or forever hold the kimenhul in the darkest corners of their minds. Once per day as a free action, a kimenhul can telepathically communicate with a creature affected by this ability for 1 minute as long as both creatures are on the same plane. For as long as the creature remains affected by a kimenhul’s eternal fear, each time the affected creature finds itself in a stressful situation (such as combat), it has a 50% chance of being shaken for 1 minute as it recalls the horror of its encounter with the kimenhul. This lingering fear persists even if the creature defeated or killed the kimenhul. This effect is instantaneous and can be removed only via a wish or miracle. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes the +2 bonus from the sahkil’s emotional focus ability.
  - name: Look of Fear (Su)
    desc: A creature affected by a kimenhul’s gaze is paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds as the victim imagines its body being warped and transformed. Even on a successful save, a creature is shaken for 1 minute, and creatures immune to paralysis that fail the save gain the cowering condition for 1d4 rounds instead. While paralyzed, the victim appears to those viewing it to transform into a terrifying creature as ghostly appendages of bone and gore randomly sprout from its body. Any creatures adjacent to the victim must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or be shaken for 1 minute. The ghostly appendages are an illusion (glamer) effect. Spells that provide immunity to fear, such as greater heroism, are automatically dispelled if they come within range of a kimenhul’s look of fear. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Snatch Between (Su)
    desc: While using skip between, a kimenhul can bring along any creatures grappling it or grappled by it, with no saving throw. A kimenhul can use skip between as either a swift or a move action.
  - name: Unsettled Mind (Su)
    desc: Any creature affected by a kimenhul’s spell, spell-like ability, or other effect with the emotion or fear descriptor (even those that have a lesser effect on a successful save) takes a -4 penalty on caster level checks, concentration checks, Will saves, and skill and ability checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for as long as it is affected by that effect and for 1d4 rounds thereafter.

# Description
Kimenhuls prey upon the fear of failure, and encourage self-loathing. While all sahkils delight in spreading fear, few can leave an indelible mark of terror on its victim like a kimenhul. Among the strongest of sahkils, kimenhuls rarely leave the Ethereal Plane. Aside from the sahkil tormentors, kimenhuls are the eldest of all sahkils, and some particularly powerful kimenhuls carve out territory in the Ethereal Plane and rule over legions of other sahkils in much the same manner. Kimenhuls that achieve long-term control are outliers among their kind, however, as the hierarchy among sahkils is more mutable and f luctuating than the rigid order of devils or kytons, or psychopomps’ strict adherence to the planar order.

 A kimenhul appears as three enormous, fused humanoid skulls with mouths full of jagged fangs, sitting atop an ever-shifting mass of limbs and faces. These latter manifestations constantly try to pull free of the kimenhul’s bulk, shrieking and wailing in fear. Sometimes a creature gazing into this f luctuating horror sees a face all too familiar-a scolding parent, an old bully, or a lost lover. This may or may not be real, as the terrifying forms stretching out from a kimenhul’s body incorporate both images from the viewer’s mind and those creatures that have fallen prey to the kimenhul’s eternal fear ability. A typical kimenhul stands 25 feet tall and weighs roughly 10,000 pounds.

 When a kimenhul telepathically communicates with those marked by its eternal fear, it constantly reminds them that they will never be good enough, and that they are utter failures in everything they do. These sahkils derive a perverse amount of pleasure from these brief mental interjections, and those that have made their horrific impression on large numbers of beings spend hours of each day engaged in this long-distance abuse.

 This lingering torment often drives a kimenhul’s victims insane, or forces them into desperation as they attempt more and more drastic means to rid themselves of the sahkil’s inf luence and predation. Many of these victims end up in the care of others, as their paranoia overtakes any ability to care for themselves and they constantly worry over whether they can actually achieve anything on their own. Doubt and distrust seep into every thought. The victim can’t get the denigrating voice out of his head, and self-destruction seems the only thing that can keep it at bay.

 Kimenhuls don’t bother with those they consider “lesser” minds, unless their intention is to cause havoc or rampant violence. They instead focus on instilling fear in the best and brightest they can f ind. Kimenhuls appreciate a challenge and even dedicate themselves to breaking down creatures that are immune to fear effects. Kimenhuls delight in tormenting the brave and confident. These cruel outsiders track down great heroes and famed generals-women and men known for courage and righteousness-and infect their otherwise strong minds with the static of constant fear. Kimenhuls share stories of their conquests with each other and any allied sahkils, bragging about the reduction of onceproud warriors to twitchy, frightened children who jump at the slightest noise.

 In combat, kimenhuls combine the use of their spelllike abilities and their physical might. Enemies out of reach fall victim to a host of different effects meant to frighten or weaken, while those nearby are at risk of being trampled or snatched up by one of the kimenhul’s fanged mouths. Kimenhuls sometimes grab enemies with their bite attacks and then use their snatch between ability to bring their victims to the Ethereal Plane.

 Once back on the Ethereal Plane, kimenhuls bring their kidnapped victims to their lairs, where they and their sahkil allies subject them to a host of frightening stimuli in hopes of driving them mad. Some of these victims linger in this prison of terror for decades, while others die from fright-or take their own lives to escape the torture of constant dread. Otherwise, kimenhuls do their best to keep their victims alive.

 Kimenhuls generally linger near those places on the Ethereal Plane where a mortal peering into that realm might brief ly glance upon their horrific visages. Most viewers only catch a terrifying, half-remembered glimpse of the sahkil and go on their ways, shaken but unscathed. Yet if the viewer looks too long into that hazy realm, a kimenhul doesn’t hesitate to expose the creature to its look of fear or eternal fear abilities, or to attempt to drag the victim back to its lair for a proper dose of terror.
