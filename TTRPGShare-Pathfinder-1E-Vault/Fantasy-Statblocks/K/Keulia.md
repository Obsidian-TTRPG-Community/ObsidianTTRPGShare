# Description
The keulia is an omnivorous lizard with a hermit crab’s penchant for acquiring and covering itself in useful detritus. This is primarily a camouflage function, allowing the reptile to blend in with its surroundings. However, more than a millennium of domestication has resulted in a less timid creature that rarely scampers or bites. Keulias today are prestige pets that Kalistocrats groom with all the care one would pay a bonsai tree, delicately coaxing the lizards to absorb gems and precious metals into their hides. They naturally shed their camouflage, and so intermittently shed a few jewels every month. Drumans have developed several superstitions and sayings about these events, considering it good luck for such a gem to fall at one’s feet.

 A spellcaster can select a keulia as a familiar. The master gains a +3 bonus on Disguise checks as a special ability.
