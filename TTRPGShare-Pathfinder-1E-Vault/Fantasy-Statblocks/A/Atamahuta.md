special_abilities:
  - name: Double Weapon Mastery (Ex)
    desc: An atamahuta fights with an orc double axe. While making a full attack, an atamahuta controls its arms with both heads and does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with a double weapon.
  - name: Spellstrike (Su)
    desc: An atamahuta can imbue its weapon with magical properties using its spell-like abilities. Whenever an atamahuta casts a spell with a range of ‚Äútouch‚Äù from its spell-like abilities, it can deliver the spell through any weapon it is holding as part of a free melee attack at its highest base attack bonus as part of casting its spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. This attack uses the weapon‚Äôs critical multiplier (usually √ó3), but the spell effect only deals 2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier. An atamahuta cannot make a full attack during the same round that it uses a spell-like ability unless another effect would allow it to do so.
  - name: Ward Off Distractions (Ex)
    desc: An atamahuta uses one of its heads to defend against attacks while the other is using a spell-like ability, giving it a +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity while casting.

# Description
Atamahuta are immensely strong oni spirits who have donned the physical guise of ettins. Combining oni‚Äôs trademark guile with ettins‚Äô unadulterated brawn, atamahuta use their two-headed forms to inf lict as much damage as possible by fusing their arcane powers with their distinctive melee combat style.

Because of the raw power they infuse into the bodies they inhabit, atamahuta are slightly bigger than normal ettins. An atamahuta is 14 feet tall and weighs 5,500 pounds.
