# Description
Bliss dragons are self-appointed wardens of wildlife and wilderness, sometimes even displacing fey and magical beasts whose ethics fall short of the dragons’ high standards. Bliss dragons often sequester refugees in their extraplanar glades, granting sanctuary and healing to those in need.
