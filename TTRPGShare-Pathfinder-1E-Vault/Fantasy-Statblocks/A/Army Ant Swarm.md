  - name: Cling (Ex)
    desc: If a creature leaves an army ant swarmâ€™s square, the swarm suffers 1d6 points of damage to reflect the loss of its numbers as several of the crawling pests continue to cling tenaciously to the victim. A creature with army ants clinging to him takes 3d6 points of damage at the end of his turn each round. As a full-round action, he can remove the ants with a DC 17 Reflex save. High wind or any amount of damage from an area effect destroys all clinging ants. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Consume (Ex)
    desc: An army ant swarm can rapidly consume any creature it swarms over. Against helpless or nauseated targets, an army ant swarm attack deals 6d6 points of damage.

# Description
The notoriety of the army ant swarm is well earned. Constantly on the march, a hive of army ants is capable of eating anything that gets in the way of its unabating swath of destruction and ruin.
