# Description
Although not inherently evil, brine dragons have little patience for kindness and philanthropy. As they age, they grow more and more opinionated and obsessed with power-by adult age, a brine dragon counts itself a failure if it doesn't rule over a collection of “lesser beings” such as humans, merfolk, locathah, or even sahuagin.
