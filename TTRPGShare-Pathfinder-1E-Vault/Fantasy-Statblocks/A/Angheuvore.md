# Description
The connection between elves and ghouls is not clearly understood; elves are resistant to ghouls' paralyzing touch, but not the disease that transforms humanoids into ghouls. Angheuvore mortics, or “half-ghouls,” are lanky, pallid creatures with an insatiable hunger for flesh. They have the long ears and featureless, dark eyes characteristic of elves but have a larger jaw filled with sharp teeth. Born from elven parents afflicted with ghoul fever or otherwise subjected to necromantic energies, angheuvores are often shunned as children due to their appetites. They typically grow up on their own or among degenerate communities of other angheuvores. Never fully satisfied without a belly full of humanoid flesh, angheuvores lurk at the edges of civilization looking for opportunities to sate their appetites. Some angheuvores keep other humanoids as prisoners to feast upon at their leisure, and the victims in these “larders” live in constant fear of becoming the next meal. Angheuvores living within humanoid communities often keep a low profile by subsisting on corpses and frequently work as gravediggers, morticians, or physicians.

 Like elves, angheuvores are long lived, often drifting from community to community for centuries. They share an appreciation for art, although angheuvore aesthetics are often unpleasant to other humanoids, as they predominantly center on the look and smell of blood, flesh, and organs. Unlike elves, angheuvores aren't particularly patient and don't take any particular care to live in harmony with their surroundings.

 Angheuvores and ghouls get along reasonably well, and they often share hunting territory or even coexist in the same isolated communities. Angheuvores enjoy the elven immunity to the ghouls' paralyzing toxin, but angheuvores are as susceptible to ghoul fever as any other humanoid, and can become infected via infighting or even by sharing food. An angheuvore who dies from ghoul fever always putrefies and rises as a ghast. These ghasts retain their memories and any class levels acquired by the angheuvore; the transition from living to undead is not as jarring a step for an angheuvore.

 Angheuvores are typically 6 feet tall and weigh about 125 pounds.
