# Description
Underworld dragons-also called futsanglungs-are calculating, greedy creatures that carve great labyrinthine tunnels beneath the world, defending their hidden treasures. Preferring the earth to the heavens, they channel the fires of the worldâ€™s core within their twisting, stonelike bodies and through flaming breath hot enough to turn granite into slag.
