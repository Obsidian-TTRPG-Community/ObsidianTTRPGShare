# Description
Temperamental and prone to violent outbursts, magma dragons are regarded by most other dragons as dangerously insane-an assumption that, more often than not, proves correct. One can rarely predict a magma dragonâ€™s state of mind until it either attacks or attempts to engage in conversation. For their part, magma dragons can justify all of their actions-they just rarely feel the need to do so.
