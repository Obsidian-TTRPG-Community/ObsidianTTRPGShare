special_abilities:
  - name: Envelop (Ex)
    desc: The Malfesh Monster can wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its vines as a standard action. The Melfesh Monster attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if the target fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. Attacks that hit the Melfesh Monster while it has a target enveloped deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
  - name: Poison Cloud (Ex)
    desc: The Melfesh Monster can exude a cloud of poisonous gas in a 20-foot radius up to 3 times per day. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1d4 hours afterward. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
The sleepy town of Melfesh has endured threats ranging from a gang of displaced troglodytes causing havoc to the strained political ramifications of having a drawbridge controlling trade through southeastern Varisia, but none trouble the place like the Melfesh Monster. Miners working the foothills of the Fenwall Mountains and farmers in the countryside surrounding Melfesh speak in hushed tones of a strange and malevolent monster that haunts the area. Those who claim to have encountered the thing return from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike creature with burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame. A stench like acrid, burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist. Adults away from the safety of town aren’t the only ones terrorized by the creature, as parents use embellished stories of the Melfesh Monster to frighten children into behaving properly.
