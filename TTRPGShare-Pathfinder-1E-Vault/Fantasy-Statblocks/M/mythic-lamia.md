special_abilities:

    desc: A mythic lamia casts spells as a 6th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a mythic lamia.
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    desc: A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time she hits with her melee touch attack. (Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia does not heal any damage when she uses her Wisdom drain.) Lamias try to use this power early in an encounter to make foes more susceptible to charm monster and suggestion.

# Description
A mythic lamia dabbled in dark pacts or strange magic in an attempt to break the ancient curse that gives her a monstrous form, but instead gained the ability to change her shape as well as other magical abilities. Impressed by her progress but angered by her lack of complete success, she continues her research and plotting.
