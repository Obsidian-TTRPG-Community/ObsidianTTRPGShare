special_abilities:
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    desc: A earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.
  - name: Petrify (Su)
    desc: If it hits a target with a slam attack, a mythic earth elemental can expend two uses of mythic power to permanently turn that target to stone. If the target succeeds at a DC 23 Fortitude save, it is slowed (as the spell) for 1d6 rounds instead of petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    desc: If a mythic earth elemental strikes an opponent with two slams in 1 round, that creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Trap Weapon (Ex)
    desc: A mythic earth elementalâ€™s body traps manufactured weapons that damage it. A manufactured weapon that deals hit point damage to the elemental (after subtracting its DR) is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 30 Reflex save. A creature can spend a standard action to attempt a DC 30 Strength check to remove a stuck weapon. Weapons that deal only bludgeoning damage are immune to this ability. The elemental can release any number of stuck weapons as a free action. The save DC is Strength-based.
