  - name: Eye Gouge (Ex)
    desc: If an argus rends or pins an opponent, as a swift action it can attempt a dirty trick maneuver to blind the target. If its combat maneuver check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the opponent is permanently blinded.

# Description
An argus is an ancient creature related to the titans (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 266-267), transformed by a deity into a vigilant and restless sentry, usually as a punishment for some affront or rebellion. Within its hideous and misshapen body lies a lonely heart that craves music and beauty to comfort it in its forlorn and unending vigil. It might talk peaceably with visitors if they promise to sing songs or tell stories (and it believes its guests don’t intend to harm it or steal what it guards). If insulted or mocked, an argus is quick to anger, dispatching foes so it can go back to brooding in peace.

An argus stands 25 feet tall and weighs 18,000 pounds.
