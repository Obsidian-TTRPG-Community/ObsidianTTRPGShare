special_abilities:
  - name: Alert Master (Su)
    desc: Three times per day, a mirror man can send a brief message to a creature it is familiar with (typically its master). This effect is similar to the sending spell, but it takes only a standard action, the communication is one way, and the target cannot respond to the sending.
  - name: Mirror Sight (Ex)
    desc: A mirror man has no eyes, but is capable of visually perceiving through the use of blindsight, darkvision, and low-light vision.
  - name: Scrying Focus (Su)
    desc: Mirror men are specifically created to interact with the spell Irriseni mirror sight (Pathfinder Adventure Path #67 73) in special ways. The construct’s mirrored face can serve as a known mirror, allowing the caster to see from the perspective of the construct’s face with normal sight. The caster may also communicate telepathically with the mirror man. As a swift action, the mirror man can choose to remember and record up to 1 minute of what it sees. This memory is visual only and can be viewed remotely through Irriseni mirror sight or played back across its face. The mirror man can only retain 1 minute of images; when its memory is full, old memories are erased so it can remember new ones. The caster may interact with the mirror man’s soul mirror even after the construct body is destroyed as long as the face itself remains unbroken. If the construct has not been destroyed, an opponent must succeed at a sunder attempt targeting the mirrored face to break the mirror. The mirrored face is considered a separate weapon with a hardness of 1 and hit points equal to the mirror man’s Hit Dice. If the construct has been destroyed, the mirrored face can be smashed as a standard action.
  - name: Soul Mirror (Su)
    desc: The soul of a mirror man is bound within its mirrored face. As long as the face remains intact, it can be affixed to a new construct body using the same cost to create a new construct. Once a soul is bound to a mirror, the soul continues to learn, and if the mirror is later affixed to a new body, the soul retains any memories from its previous bodies.
  - name: Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex)
    desc: The self-aware and autonomous nature of a mirror man makes it susceptible to mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct.

desc_short: Tall and lean, this hooded figure resembles a human until the terrible face beneath the cowl is revealed-nothing but a featureless mirror, reflecting a hard, cold world.

# Description
At a glance, mirror men are easily mistaken for humans. They are tall, slender, and graceful and mask their true selves in fine hooded cloaks appropriate to Irrisen’s eternal winter. Nevertheless, their grace is the product of precision, not elegance, and their hooded garments serve to obscure an inhuman countenance. A mirror man has no eyes, nose, or mouth. Its face is a featureless mirror, affixed atop a lifeless body. Behind this mirror is a vacant hole left behind when the body was prepared for its current use.
