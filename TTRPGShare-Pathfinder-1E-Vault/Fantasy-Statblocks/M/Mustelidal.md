special_abilities:
  - name: Celestial Strike (Ex)
    desc: A mustelidal’s unarmed attacks are treated similarly to those of an 18th-level brawler (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 23). They deal 2d8 points of lethal bludgeoning damage, though the mustelidal can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. The mustelidal applies his full Strength modifier on all damage rolls with his unarmed strike. A mustelidal’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. A mustelidal’s unarmed strikes are treated as magic, cold iron, silver, and adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
  - name: Poison Purge (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, a mustelidal who has been poisoned can will himself into an unconscious state for 10 minutes. During this time, the mustelidal suffers no further effects from the poison, and cannot be roused from this deathlike trance by any means. At the end of the 10 minutes, the mustelidal awakens completely cured of any poisons that were affecting him. This doesn’t heal the mustelidal of any existing ability damage or drain the poison may have already caused. If the mustelidal succumbs to a poison that causes unconsciousness, this ability triggers automatically.
  - name: Reckless Bravura (Ex)
    desc: As a swift action when a mustelidal is flanked or within the area threated by a creature whose size is at least Huge, the mustelidal can enter a frenzy, taking a -2 penalty to his AC and gaining a +2 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. The mustelidal can leave this state as a free action only after reducing an enemy to 0 hit points or fewer or when there are no enemies in the mustelidal’s line of sight.

# Description
Tenacious warriors, mustelidals are the protectors of the good and neutral burrowing creatures of the universe, fending off such evil underground threats as neothelids, purple worms, and shaitans. These agathions are difficult to kill and see defeat in battle as little more than an annoying roadblock delaying their eventual victory.

Mustelidals look like humanoid badgers with black fur and a white stripe running from the crowns of their heads all the way down their backs. They often wear open yet loose-fitting clothing that shows off their toned physiques and allows them more freedom of movement in battle. They prefer to dress in deep, rich browns accented with warm colors, such as yellows and oranges. An average mustelidal stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.
