    desc: If a mythic troll takes damage during a round, its regeneration increases by 5 at the start of its next turn, to a maximum of 25. If the troll is at full hit points at the start of its turn, its regeneration decreases by 5, to a minimum of 5. Damaging the troll with acid or fire only partially suppresses its regeneration. On its turn following this damage, the troll regenerates only half the normal number of hit points (for example, a troll with regeneration 15 would heal 7 hit points) and can die normally on that round.

# Description
A mythic trollâ€™s skin is nearly as hard as stone, with bony growths, ornamental head spikes, and oversized teeth adding to its already grotesque visage.
