desc_short: A beast leapt forth from the flames of Hell, this gigantic, threeheaded hound howls a sound like the cacophony of a raging wildfire. Large enough to heft a horse in its monstrous maws, this terror bears no flesh, its body merely a thing of exposed bone and charred musculature. From its three fanged mouths leap tongues of flame, and crimson saliva leaks from the terror’s skeletal jaws.
