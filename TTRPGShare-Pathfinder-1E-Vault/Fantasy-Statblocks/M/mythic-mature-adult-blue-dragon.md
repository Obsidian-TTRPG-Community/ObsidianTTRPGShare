special_abilities:
  - name: Bend Bolt (Su)
    desc: By expending one use of mythic power, a mythic blue dragon can bend the line of its breath weapon once up to 90 degrees, and cause any creature that fails its save against the breath weapon to be stunned for 1 round.
  - name: Desert Thirst (Su)
    desc: A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL equals its HD). Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature’s possession must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Dust Cloud (Ex)
    desc: Sand and dust swirls around a mythic blue dragon’s body, attracted by its natural electrical charge. This provides the dragon with concealment but doesn’t interfere with the dragon’s senses or attacks in any way.
  - name: Persuasive Whisper (Sp)
    desc: A mythic blue dragon can expend one use of mythic power to use charm person or suggestion. Its caster level for these abilities is equal to its Hit Dice.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    desc: A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener’s Sense Motive check.
