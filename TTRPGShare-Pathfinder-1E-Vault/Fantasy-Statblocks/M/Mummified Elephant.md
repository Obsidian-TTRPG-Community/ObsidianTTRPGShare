# Description
Mummified elephants are difficult to prepare because of the animals’ great size. As a result, they’re rare-typically only found in the tombs of the wealthiest Osirians. Since the animals are less common in the deep deserts, mummified elephants are more likely to be found in tombs in southern Osirion.
