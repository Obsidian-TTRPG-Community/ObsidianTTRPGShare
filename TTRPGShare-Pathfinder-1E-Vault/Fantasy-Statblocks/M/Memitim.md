    desc: Every round, any creature within 50 feet of a memitim that has -1 or fewer hit points and is stable must succeed at a DC 23 Will saving throw or be affected by the spell bleed. Any dying creature within this range does not receive a Constitution check to stabilize, but can be healed as normal-though it can be affected by bleed in subsequent rounds if not restored to 0 or more hit points. Any creatures with fast healing or regeneration must succeed at a DC 23 Will save every round or that ability does not function for 1 round. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

# Description
Soldiers know memitims as the angels of death who protect fallen combatants and others who die as mass casualties from soul-hungry scavengers. While most memitims preside over massacres, their full wrath manifests against any who would cut numerous lives short in an unnatural pursuit of souls.
