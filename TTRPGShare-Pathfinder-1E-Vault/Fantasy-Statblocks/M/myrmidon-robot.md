special_abilities:
  - name: Laser Rifle (Ex)
    desc: A myrmidon’s eye is an integrated laser rifle with a range increment of 250 feet.
  - name: Quantum Lash (Ex)
    desc: A myrmidon’s two facial tentacles lash out with surprising force, and are capable of extending up to a reach of 20 feet. These lashes are primary attacks that deal force damage on a hit. They resolve as touch attacks, but the damage dealt is not modified by Strength, nor can it be improved by Power Attack. A quantum lash threatens a critical hit on a natural 19-20. A quantum lash that strikes a force field or force effect has a chance to disrupt that effect. Against a magical force effect like a wall of force, the myrmidon makes a special check as if it were casting dispel magic against the effect (CL 11th). Against a robot’s force field, the robot struck must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or its force field deactivates for 1d10 rounds, after which time the robot reactivates at the same hit point total it was at before it was deactivated. The save DC is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Resilient (Ex)
    desc: Myrmidons receive a +3 racial bonus on all saving throws.
  - name: Rockets (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a myrmidon can fire a rocket to a range of 800 feet. A rocket explodes on impact in a 30-foot-radius burst, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage and 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex DC 18 half). A myrmidon carries a maximum of five rockets. It can replenish fired rockets at the rate of one per 12 hours, crafting new rockets from scrap metal and other collected components. The save DC is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Superior Optics (Ex)
    desc: Myrmidons see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.

# Description
Myrmidons are highly mobile robots programmed to patrol the skies above important locations. They react with swift violence, interpret anomalous sensory input as proof of hostile intent and rain destruction on the offending target immediately and without mercy. Most have been programmed to communicate, but they rarely hesitate in their carnage to do so.
