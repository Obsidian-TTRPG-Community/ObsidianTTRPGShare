special_abilities:
  - name: Curse of Yig (Su)
    desc: Once per round as a free action when he touches or damages a creature with any natural attack, Yig can target that creature with a potent curse. The target must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or it takes a -6 penalty on all saving throws against poison effects and loses the ability to recover from poison effects naturally (though magical effects that remove poison effects still work). The cursed creature cannot gain the benefit of immunity to poison, be it from a class or racial ability, a magic item, or any other source. As long as it suffers under the curse of Yig, the victim becomes staggered for 1d6 rounds whenever it fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting or poison effect, and any offspring sired or birthed are deformed in some hideous (but mostly cosmetic) fashion. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Devastating (Ex)
    desc: All of Yig’s natural attacks are primary attacks that add 1-1/2 × his Strength modifier to their damage. Yig ignores hardness less than 20 for any object he strikes.
  - name: Immortality (Ex)
    desc: If Yig is slain, his body decays as normal, but he does not stay dead for long. He is reborn 3 months after his death, hatching from the egg of a venomous serpent (although not necessarily on the same planet on which his previous incarnation was slain). He spends a year in the form of a venomous (but otherwise normal) snake, after which he sheds his skin and emerges once again as Yig. Typically, Yig does not hold grudges against those who slew him, but this is not always the case.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Constitution drain plus nauseated for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Serpentine Dreams (Su)
    desc: Any creature that has ever willfully harmed a snake, has suffered the effects of the curse of Yig (see above), or has slain one of Yig’s clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One’s serpentine dreams, regardless of the distance between the creature and Yig-even across planar boundaries. In order to use serpentine dreams against a target, Yig must first successfully affect the target with his nightmare spell-like ability. If the victim fails its save against nightmare, it must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or take 2d6 points of Intelligence drain in addition to the normal effects of nightmare. When this Intelligence drain would reduce the victim’s Intelligence score below 2, the victim is instead transformed (as if via baleful polymorph) into a Tiny venomous snake. This is a mind-affecting polymorph effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unspeakable Presence (Ex)
    desc: Failing a DC 35 Will save against Yig’s unspeakable presence causes the victim to become more susceptible to curse effects. The victim takes a -6 penalty on all saving throws against curse effects, and the effective DC to remove a curse from such a victim increases by 6. A creature normally immune to curses that is affected by Yig’s unspeakable presence can now be affected by curses (but takes no further penalty against curses as a result of the Great Old One’s unspeakable presence). This effect lasts for 1 year or until removed by a miracle or wish. If a creature suffering from this effect dies and is brought back to life, there is a 50% chance the effect persists upon the creature’s restoration to life.

# Description
Of all the Great Old Ones, Yig is without a doubt the most benign. Yet those so foolish as to expect kindness from the so-called Father of Serpents would do well to think again, for Yig does not suffer fools and is as likely to devour those who beseech him for help as he is to provide aid. Even his most devout worshipers realize he may simply wish to feed at times, and on these occasions no amount of devotion can protect a supplicant from death. 

Yig appears as a scaled, humanoid creature with a serpent’s head and lashing tail, but he can appear as any serpentine creature if he so wills. In his true form, Yig stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds.
