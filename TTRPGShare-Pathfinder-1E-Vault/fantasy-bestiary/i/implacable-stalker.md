Any creature that strikes a babau with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of acid damage from this slime if it fails a DC 21 Reflex save. A creature that strikes a babau with a melee weapon must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or the weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage; if this damage penetrates the weapon’s hardness, the weapon gains the broken condition. Ammunition that strikes a babau is automatically destroyed after it inflict its damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Implacable stalkers embody murderous predation. They not only revel in hunting down and killing their victims in gory, brutal fashion, but they draw supernatural strength and power from their victims’ fear and terror. They look similar to other creatures of their kind, but are often covered in gruesome scars and exude an aura of menace.
