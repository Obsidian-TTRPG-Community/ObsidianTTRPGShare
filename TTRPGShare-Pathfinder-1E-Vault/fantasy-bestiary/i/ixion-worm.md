special_abilities:
  - name: Dual Form (Ex)
    desc: An ixion worm can take one of two forms: a serpentine skin-sack of clattering bones, and a taut, self-ambulatory wheel. An ixion worm in its wheel form possesses the euphoric gaze, hypnotic wheel, and powerful charge special abilities. When in serpentine form, the ixion worm gains a 10-foot bonus to its speed, a climb speed of 10 feet, a +2 dodge bonus to its Armor Class, and the constrict special attack. Changing between its forms is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, though an ixion worm in its wheel form that becomes prone may take on its serpentine form as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    desc: This ability functions as the universal monster rule of the same name, but rather than granting the ixion worm temporary hit points, it instead grants 1 additional use of its 3/day spell-like abilities per level drained. This additional use is available for 1 hour and is consumed only after the ixion worm’s normal daily uses of its spell-like abilities have been expended.
  - name: Euphoric Gaze (Su)
    desc: Three times a day as a move action, when in its wheel form, an ixion worm can unfocus its eye and spin it in a mesmerizing whirl to gain a gaze attack that affects all creatures within 30 feet as per euphoric tranquilityAPG (CL 14th, Will DC 22 partial). The effect is persistent but immediately ends if the ixion worm threatens or is threatened by a creature, uses any other special abilities, or moves in any way but a straight line. The effect also ends for creatures that move beyond the range of the gaze attack. While sustaining this effect, the ixion worm also takes a -8 penalty on visual Perception checks.
  - name: Hypnotic Wheel (Su)
    desc: A rolling ixion worm’s face is hypnotically grotesque. An ixion worm in wheel form can take a full-round action to move up to twice its speed. If it moves at least 20 feet as part of such an action, it can target a creature within 30 feet that is visible from any square in its path with a 14th-level mesmerist’s hypnotic stare (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 39) that has the allure, susceptibility, and timidity bold stare improvements (Occult Adventures 42). The stare’s effects last until the start of the ixion worm’s next turn, regardless of the ixion worm’s location. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Ixion worms are both literal and figurative cogs in Phlegethon’s workings. Each is forged of flesh stretched over massive bones, and each bears the identical face of a hypnotically entrancing male cyclops. Its bones can slither as a crooked serpent or join at the ends to form a wheel, with its face freely sliding around the structure to spin on one side of the hub as it rolls itself around. The rotation amplifies the ixion worm’s hypnotic abilities, which it uses to motivate Phlegethon’s petitioners into working harder in the layer’s mines and forges.

The ixion worm’s mouth dribbles with a prismatic oily residue that corrodes and absorbs the souls of whatever creatures with which it mingles. The worm’s size and mass-5 feet wide, 9 feet in radius in wheel form, nearly 30 feet long unrolled, and 600 pounds in weight- also make the creature a terrifying physical force as it careens down the narrow paths of Phlegethon’s crags. The ixion worm’s entrancing gaze and mental powers, however, are what make it an effective and intimidating enforcer; few of Phlegethon’s lesser inhabitants consider challenging what they quickly believe is their only friend in Hell.
