    desc: A character with an ioun wyrd familiar gains the benefit of the wyrd’s ioun stones as long as the character is within 30 feet of the ioun wyrd.

## Description
At first glance, these creatures appear to resemble some manner of earth elementals, but they’re actually bizarre constructs created by spellcasters from certain types of minerals and gemstones. Ioun wyrds are occasionally found in the wild, typically near the haunts of spellcasters and arcane societies where the strange little creatures escaped their former masters.

A typical ioun wyrd is roughly 2 feet in diameter and weighs between 15 and 20 pounds.
