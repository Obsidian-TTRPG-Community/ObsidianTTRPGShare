  - name: Grasping Chains (Ex)
    desc: An iron rhinoceros is covered in animated chains that grasp at its enemies. It doesn’t gain the grappled condition when using its chains to grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free action, though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An iron rhinoceros may have up to two creatures grappled in its chains at a time. Additionally, the chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino tramples. The chains entangle any creature that fails its saving throw against the rhinoceros’s trample attack, or that chooses to forgo its save in order to make an attack of opportunity against the rhinoceros. An entangled creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by succeeding on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each chain has AC 12, hardness 10, and 15 hit points. Creatures entangled in the chains can’t move farther than 20 feet away from the rhinoceros. If the rhinoceros moves farther than 20 feet from an entangled target, the tethering chain breaks, but the target remains entangled.
  - name: Powerful Drag (Ex)
    desc: An iron rhinoceros can use the dragAPG combat maneuver to savagely scrape its foes across the ground. As a full-round action, an iron rhinoceros can attempt a single drag combat maneuver against every creature currently tethered to its grasping chains. This deals 1d6 points of damage for every 5 feet dragged, and the chains tethered to any creature more than 20 feet away break. The dragging damage may increase depending on the terrain, at the GM’s discretion. Creatures dragged any distance are knocked prone.
  - name: Scooping Charge (Ex)
    desc: An iron rhinoceros can unhinge its snout in order to scoop enemies into the furnace-like cavity within its belly. When making a powerful charge, the iron rhinoceros can forgo dealing damage in order to gain the grab and fast swallow abilities with its gore attack. The rhinoceros must make this choice at the beginning of its charge.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    desc: An iron rhinoceros’s belly functions as a furnace, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to swallowed creatures. Hatches on the rhinoceros’s sides allow it to swallow creatures grappled in its chains. In order to take swallowed creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the rhinoceros can suppress (or activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift action. When the rhinoceros is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead fills with smoke, forcing swallowed creatures to succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save each round or be sickened for as long as they remain in the rhinoceros’s belly. This save DC is Constitutionbased. Creatures attempting to cut their way out of the iron rhinoceros’s belly must overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10).

    desc: 86
desc_short: Dangling chains cover the riveted iron body of this massive rhinoceros like thick, woolly fur. Its hollow eyes glow-windows into a mighty furnace-and smoke that smells suspiciously like burning flesh billows from its smokestack horns.

## Description
The brutality of fire giants is matched only by their ingenuity at crafting devices of war. Of all their creations, however, few match the ruthless efficiency or raw power of the iron rhinoceros. Built to sate the fire giants’ endless desire for slaves, iron rhinoceroses serve as both tireless mounts for giant warlords campaigning against lesser races and as temporary prisons for troublesome captives.

An iron rhinoceros measures 18 feet long from snout to tail and stands 12 feet tall at the shoulder.
