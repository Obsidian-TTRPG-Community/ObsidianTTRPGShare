    desc: Once per hour, a xocothian can transform itself into two Small elementals (one air and one water) for up to 7 minutes. These elementals appear in adjacent squares. Each have half of the xocothian’s current hit points and share the same mind. They can reform into the xocothian as a standard action if they are adjacent to each other-the reformed xocothian’s hit points are equal to the total of the two elementals’ hit points. If either elemental is slain, the xocothian must use its standard action on its next turn to reform (treat a slain elemental’s hit points as 0 when determining the reformed xocothian’s total hit points).

    desc: A xocothian can fly or swim up to 200 feet as a full-round action. When using this ability, it must move in a straight line. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

## Description
A xocothian is a physical manifestation of Gozreh’s dual nature and destructive power. As a creature that has a form mingling both fish and fowl, it’s as at home in the water as it is in the air. A xocothian amuses itself by manipulating clouds-it can fly in a way that whips off portions of clouds, allowing the creature to sculpt the cloud into fantastic creations. When on the sea, the creature dives in and out of the waves in a way that looks almost like a massive skipping stone dipping below the waves with each strike and then erupting into the air in a spray of sea water.

Blunt and impatient, xocothians aren’t fond of nuanced manipulation or clever gambits when dealing with others. They prefer straightforward approaches to obstacles and problems, and always takes such a route unless impeded in some way.

When on the Material Plane and not called into service by mortal worshipers of Gozreh, xocothians enjoy exploring the natural wonders of the world. They splash through the seas, and soar through the skies, keeping away from civilization on these travels. Sometimes when encountering mortals, the creatures hide themselves in obscuring mist, hoping to be mistaken as a cloud.

When at sea, they sometimes surge past ships underwater or in the air to create confusion and panic. When feeling sociable, they chat with local animals and discuss matters of weather and migrations with members of Gozreh’s faith and respectful druids of other religions. They grow outraged with mortals who poison or pollute water and even those who befoul the air with bad smells (such as by burning garbage, casting stinking cloud, or running a tannery). Although they don’t need to eat, they sometimes choose to do so for pleasure, enjoying the sort of food that a carnivorous fish or bird would consume.

As enigmatic as its creator, a xocothian may refer to itself as “I,” “we,” “she,” “he,” “it,” or “they,” whether in one body or two. Xocothians are about 8 feet long and weigh around 650 pounds.
