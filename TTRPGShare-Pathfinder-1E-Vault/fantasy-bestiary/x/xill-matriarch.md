special_abilities:
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a xill matriarch can lay 4d6 eggs in a helpless creature. These eggs hatch in 24 hours, at which point the young consume the host from within, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage per hour per young until the host dies. The young then emerge and planewalk to the Ethereal Plane, if possible. A remove disease spell (or similar effect) rids a victim of all implanted eggs or active young, or they can be cut out one at a time with successful DC 25 Heal checks (each attempt takes 10 minutes). If the healer fails the check, he can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient. Xill matriarchs can take mental control of creatures in which they have implanted eggs as a full-round action. This functions as dominate monster (CL 13th) and works at any distance, even between the Ethereal Plane and Material Plane. The host takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw to resist the matriarch’s control. While dominated, the victim is immune to xills’ paralysis ability. The matriarch can use greater scrying on the dominated victim at will (no saving throw). A matriarch can maintain one such link at a time; if she wants to use dominate monster or greater scrying on a different creature implanted with her eggs, she must end the effects on her current victim (though she can switch back later).
  - name: Matriarch Weapon Mastery (Ex)
    desc: A xill matriarch never takes penalties on attack rolls when fighting with multiple weapons, adds her full Strength modifier on damage rolls with off-hand attacks, and treats her claws as primary attacks even when also wielding weapons. She is considered to have the Two-Weapon Fighting and Double Slice feats for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites.
  - name: Swift Planewalk (Su)
    desc: A xill matriarch can shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane, and vice versa, as a move action, and can take a single willing or helpless creature with her if she chooses.

## Description
Xill matriarchs are paragons of their kind, having undergone a ritualistic metamorphosis involving the consumption of brain matter from xill egg hosts. The matriarchs possess powerful mental abilities, which they use to protect the young of their race.
