special_abilities:
  - name: Bloodbath (Su)
    desc: Pallid angels are avatars of slaughter, delighting in the bloody carnality of combat. When a pallid angel kills a creature using a manufactured melee weapon, she can splash its blood (or similar remains) on herself as a free action, even if it’s not her turn. This grants her 8 temporary hit points and a +2 profane bonus to Strength. These benefits stack with themselves, to a maximum of 40 temporary hit points and a +10 bonus to Strength, and they last until 1 minute after the pallid angel last used this ability.
  - name: Hunger for Life and Death (Su)
    desc: A pallid angel is healed by both positive and negative energy. In addition, whenever a positive energy or negative energy effect would heal or harm one or more creatures within 30 feet, the pallid angel can consume the energy as an immediate action. The pallid angel regains a number of hit points equal to the greatest amount of healing or damage a targeted creature would receive, and no other creatures are affected by the effect. A pallid angel can consume energy this way three times per day.
  - name: Profane Ward (Su)
    desc: A pallid angel’s spell resistance is increased by 5 against spells with the good descriptor and spells cast by worshippers of good-aligned deities.

## Description
Urgathoa is known best as a goddess of plague and undeath, yet the Pallid Princess has wider interests than the uninitiated might assume. Pallid angels, created by Urgathoa from the souls of her most dedicated champions and priestesses, represent these interests. Warriors and tacticians, wielders of profane magic and cruel weaponry, pallid angels are embodiments of the goddess’s appetite for wanton bloodshed and forbidden pleasures.

 The average pallid angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
