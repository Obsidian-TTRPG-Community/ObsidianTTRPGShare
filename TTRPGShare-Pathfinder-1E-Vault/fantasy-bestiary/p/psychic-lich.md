## Description
While some liches prefer to spend undeath’s eternity in seclusion, a psychic lich sustains its life force by embracing its personal accomplishments to create a powerful astral echo of itself. Even more megalomaniacal than most liches, psychic liches resemble ordinary liches for the most part, but their every moment is attended by ghostly images of past cruelties, a constantly rotating illusory display of the evil deeds that brought them their power. Most psychic liches are humans, or come from other races renowned for their psychic abilities.
