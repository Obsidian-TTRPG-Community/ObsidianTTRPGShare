  - name: Blistering Slime (Ex)
    desc: A creature that leaves a pest drake swarm’s space becomes coated in acidic slime. A creature coated in acidic slime takes 3d6 points of acid damage at the end of its turn each round. As a full-round action, an affected creature can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to clean off the slime. Dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +4 bonus on this save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Caustic Cloud (Su)
    desc: The dragons making up the pest drake swarm can coordinate their acidic breath together to create a caustic cloud as a standard action. The pest drake swarm can create a caustic cloud once every 1d4 rounds. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst, including creatures within the swarm’s squares, take 8d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Homing (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, the pest drake swarm can determine its approximate distance from its home as well as the direction it must travel to reach it. A pest drake must spend 1 week in a new location to designate the new location as its home.

## Description
Roosting on statuary and eaves, pest drakes are the bane of masons and carpenters across Golarion. By itself, a single pest drake is a tolerated nuisance, eating insects and other vermin in the city. Its distinctive song-like chirp greets passersby and thanks those who throw it scraps of food. When pest drakes gather, however, they become much more dangerous. The little wyvern-like dragons erode the stone where they nest and grow territorial in large groups, becoming deadly, acid-spitting flocks when agitated.

 Some of the smallest dragons, adult pest drakes are just under a foot in length and weigh 1-2 pounds. They live approximately 10-15 years.
