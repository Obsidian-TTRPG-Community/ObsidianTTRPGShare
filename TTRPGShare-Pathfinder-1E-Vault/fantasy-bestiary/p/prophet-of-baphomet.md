## Description
Just as minotaurs believe they’re direct descendants of Baphomet, minotaur prophets consider themselves his ideal mortal servitors. Prophets favor cunning gambits and manipulation over direct confrontation, and toy with captives and even their own cultists. Prophets also honor the Lord of the Labyrinth’s more bestial interests; worshipers and enemies alike often fall victim to a prophet’s monstrous appetite for flesh.
