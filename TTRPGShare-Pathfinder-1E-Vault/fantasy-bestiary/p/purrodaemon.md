special_abilities:
  - name: Weapon Steep (Su)
    desc: A purrodaemon can sheathe a weapon in its flesh as a swift action. This does no damage to the daemon. If a weapon remains sheathed in its body for at least 24 hours, the weapon absorbs some of its essence and gains magical enhancements. A purrodaemon can have up to a dozen weapons lodged in its body at a time, but only one can possess magical enhancements at a time. The total enhancements cannot exceed a +4 effective enhancement-most purrodaemons opt to create +2 wounding weapons in this manner. A weapon’s enhancements vanish as soon as the purrodaemon dies or releases the weapon. A purrodaemon gains Weapon Focus and Improved Critical as bonus feats as long as it wields a weapon benefiting from its weapon steep ability.

## Description
Deacons of War, purrodaemons ravage the planes as generals of massive battles. They employ creative tactics and never launch an assault without carefully looking over the plans or surveying the battlefield themselves. A purrodaemon is 12 feet tall and weighs 1,300 pounds.
