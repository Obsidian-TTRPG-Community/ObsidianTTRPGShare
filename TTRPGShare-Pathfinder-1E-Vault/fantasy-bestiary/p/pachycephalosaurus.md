    desc: When a pachycephalosaurus hits a target with its slam attack at the end of a charge, it can initiate a bull rush as a free action to move the struck target back in the same direction as the dinosaur’s charge. The pachycephalosaurus cannot move with the target of the bull rush. If a pachycephalosaurus scores a critical hit against a creature with its slam attack at the end of a charge, it also staggers the target for 1 round. If the victim succeeds at a DC 18 Fortitude save, the stagger effect is negated, but the victim still suffers the effects of the dinosaur’s bull rush attempt. The save DC is Strength-based.

## Description
A pachycephalosaurus is a normally peaceful dinosaur that grows irate and violent during mating season or when its herd is intruded upon by potential predators. The dinosaur’s skull has a distinctive dome-shaped crown surrounded by numerous bony horns-this, combined with the dinosaur’s powerful, compact neck, allows it to make battering-ram-like charges capable of inflicting great damage.

Pachycephalosauruses grow to a length of 15 feet and weigh 1,400 pounds.
