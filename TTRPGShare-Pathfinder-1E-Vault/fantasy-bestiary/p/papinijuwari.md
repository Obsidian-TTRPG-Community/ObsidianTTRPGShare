special_abilities:
  - name: Devour Disease (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a papinijuwari can suck the life force out of a diseased creature within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. An affected creature must immediately succeed at a saving throw against one disease affecting it or suffer that disease’s effect. This saving throw does not count against the number of saves required to cure the disease. If it fails the saving throw, the papinijuwari gains 30 temporary hit points.
  - name: Sense Decay (Su)
    desc: A papinijuwari is under the constant effects of deathwatch, and can detect creatures currently infected by disease as if by the scent ability.
  - name: Shooting Star (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a papinijuwari can fly at a speed of 300 feet. The papinijuwari can use this ability only outside at night, and must be at least 500 feet above the ground to do so. It must also hold a lit torch while doing so; the torch need not be magical, and while held by the papinijuwari, the torch’s flame is not subject to mundane effects that would extinguish it, such as the wind.

## Description
Racing across the skies and preying on diseased humanoids of all kinds, the merciless, cyclopean papinijuwaris are the hated cousins of cloud giants. Even evil cloud giants regard papinijuwaris with disdain, as their hunting practices offend the more “refined” giants’ delicate sensibilities.

 Papinijuwaris are agents of death and pestilence, feeding off of the suffering they help to spread. In some humanoid cultures, the sight of a shooting star heralds the arrival of the dreaded papinijuwaris, who invisibly stalk through settlements at night, hastening the progression of diseases.

 A full-grown papinijuwari stands about 20 feet tall and weighs nearly 6,000 pounds.
