  - name: Self-Petrification (Ex)
    desc: A petrifern can petrify itself as a standard action in order to defend itself from predators. When it does so, the petrifern’s natural armor bonus to AC increases by 5, it gains resistance 10 to cold and fire, and it can take 20 on Stealth checks to appear as a sprout or fallen tree branch. While petrified, the petrifern can’t move or take any actions. A petrifern can remain petrified indefinitely, and it can cease its petrification as a standard action.
  - name: Toxic Secretion (Ex)
    desc: Petriferns secrete a bitter toxin meant to make them distasteful to predators. Once per day when a creature touches a petrifern, the plant can release its toxin, causing the attacker to become sickened for 1d4 rounds if it fails a DC 11 Fortitude saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
The petrifern is an unusual plant creature that resembles a small, humanoid-shaped fern. It is able to walk about on its roots. A petrifern has the unusual ability to petrify itself at will, hardening its branches and leaves to resemble those of a plant that has been fossilized by natural means. Its chemical makeup not only allows it to petrify itself but also doubles as a toxin that the plant can emit from its foliage when it senses danger.

 Like all plants, petriferns subsist on oxygen, sunlight, and water. But unlike most flora, they can relocate themselves to ensure they always receive an abundance of nutrients. Once rooted, a petrifern typically petrifies itself until either the nearby soil is depleted of nutrients or external factors cause it to seek sustenance elsewhere.

 Petriferns reach a maximum height of 1 foot and weigh up to 3 pounds.
