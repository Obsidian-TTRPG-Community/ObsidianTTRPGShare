    desc: As a standard action, an enchanter heron can fill the membrane beneath its beak with air. The membrane then glows with blue light, and creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or be fascinated. This effect lasts as long as the enchanter heron keeps the membrane filled with air, plus 1 additional round. An enchanter heron can hold air in its throat sac for up to 1 minute; releasing the air is a free action. The fascinated effect immediately ends if the enchanter heron moves more than 60 feet away from an affected creature. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher receives a +4 bonus to its saving throw. Once a creature has been subject to this effect (whether or not its saving throw is successful), it is immune to it for the next 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting enchantment effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

## Description
Enchanter herons are large birds with bioluminescent throat sacs-the result of prolonged exposure to magical fallout. Each stands about 8 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
