special_abilities:
  - name: Deep Dweller (Ex)
    desc: Deep ones are immune to damage from water pressure; their bodies are capable of instantly adjusting to different water depths or even the surface with ease.
  - name: Devastating Strike (Ex)
    desc: An elder deep one ignores the first 10 points of hardness when it damages an object with its claws. A creature struck with a critical hit from an elder deep one's claw must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Deific
    desc: An elder deep one can grant divine spells to its worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the elder deep one's behalf. Elder deep ones grant access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and Water. Their symbols vary, but their favored weapon is the claw.
  - name: Immortal (Ex)
    desc: A deep one does not age. Barring death from violence, disease, or misadventure, a deep one can live forever. Deep ones are immune to effects that cause magical aging.
  - name: Item Use (Su)
    desc: A deep one can activate spell-trigger items like staves and wands as if it were a spellcaster of the appropriate class.
  - name: Mind Reflection (Ex)
    desc: Any mind-affecting effect that fails to affect an elder deep one is reflected back on the source, affecting the original caster as if by spell turning, treating the elder deep one as the controller and source of the spell.
  - name: Staggering Presence (Ex)
    desc: This ability functions as frightful presence, except that a creature that fails its save is also staggered as long as it remains in the area of effect, and for an additional 1d6 rounds after leaving that area. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

## Description
A few deep ones never stop growing over the eons of their endless lives. Many elder deep ones claim the names of monsters or gods for their own-Mother Hydra and Father Dagon being two of the more legendary of their kind. Elder deep ones ascend to the status of near-gods in deep one society, towering over their kin and ruling their sunken cities. Just as they are worshiped, so do the elder deep ones worship the Great Old Ones and Outer Gods themselves.
