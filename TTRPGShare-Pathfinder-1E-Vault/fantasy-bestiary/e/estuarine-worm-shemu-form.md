special_abilities:
  - name: Guiding Star (Su)
    desc: When the estuarine worm is in ahket form, its bioluminescence attracts weak-minded creatures. Any creature within 120 feet that attempts to move during its turn must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be forced to move toward the estuarine worm instead of in its intended direction. This ability is otherwise treated a gaze attack. This ability is a mind-affecting illusion (pattern) effect, though vermin are not immune to this effect. The estuarine worm can activate and deactivate this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Seasonal Transformation (Ex)
    desc: An estuarine worm has two forms: ahket (wet season) and shemu (dry season). In its shemu form, the estuarine worm is one size category smaller than when it’s in its ahket form. Further, its Strength and Dexterity decrease by 8 and it loses its damage reduction. It also loses its guiding star ability and its willful special quality. Its natural armor bonus increases by 8 and it gains DR 15/bludgeoning. In addition, all of the creature’s movement speeds are decreased by 10 feet.

An estuarine worm assumes its shemu form if it goes 24 hours without exposure to water. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a control water (lower water), greater polymorph, flesh to stone, or transmute mud to rock spell immediately shifts to its shemu form (instead of experiencing the spell’s normal effect).

An estuarine worm takes on ahket form if it is submerged in water for 24 hours. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a control water (raise water), greater polymorph, stone to flesh, or transmute rock to mud spell immediately shifts to its ahket form (instead of experiencing the spell’s normal effect).
  - name: Willful (Ex)
    desc: In ahket form, an estuarine worm gains a +4 competence bonus to Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.

When Alboras, one of the brightest navigable stars, returns to the night sky, it is a sure sign the River Sphinx will soon flood its banks and replenish the land after the harvest. The inundation also revives the rare but deadly estuarine worms. During the wet season, which is called akhet in Osiriani, the giant worms hunt the flooded plains. When the waters recede and Alboras disappears below the horizon again, the estuarine worms retreat as well. During shemu, the dry season, they enter a semi-torpid state and lie buried beneath the dry soil for protection.

A typical estuarine worm measures 25 feet long and 3 feet wide during the wet season. The worms have a bioluminescent organ atop their heads. At night, the tiny, flickering light might be mistaken for a star low on the horizon. When the dry season comes, the estuarine worm contracts to become half as long and half as wide. Its skin, once soft and spongy like wet mud, becomes as hard as stone.
