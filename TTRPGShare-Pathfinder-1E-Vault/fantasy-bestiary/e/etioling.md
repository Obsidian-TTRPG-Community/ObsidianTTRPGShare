special_abilities:
  - name: Corrupting Touch (Su)
    desc: An etioling can corrupt living flesh with her touch as a standard action. This attack inflicts a number of d6 equal to its CR in damage (10d6 for most etiolings). This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, as are undead and creatures with the mortic subtype; otherwise, the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the damage dealt. An etioling cannot turn this ability off.
  - name: Ectoplasmic Seep (Su)
    desc: An etioling’s body constantly weeps ectoplasm-a physical manifestation of the bleachling apathy her body can no longer contain. Any creature touching or being touched by an etioling, or attacking her with a melee weapon, must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or be coated in this fluid apathy, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls, caster level checks, saving throws, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls until the ectoplasm can be scraped off as a standard action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Ectoplasmic Shield (Su)
    desc: An etioling adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
  - name: Ghostly Gasp (Su)
    desc: In addition to the normal abilities all mortics gain when using their death gasp, an etioling gains a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) and can pass through walls and other solid obstructions as if under the effects of ethereal jaunt, except that the etioling cannot pass through living creatures or plants. While moving through a wall or other solid object in this way, the etioling treats the structure as difficult terrain and must use additional movement to pass through it.
  - name: Spells (Ex)
    desc: An etioling casts spells as a 10th-level bard but cannot cast spells while holding her breath.

## Description
Perhaps the most miserable of the mortics-humanoids infused with necrotic energy-etiolings are born from gnomes who have already begun to suffer from the Bleaching. The burst of negative energy into their living flesh twists the process and awakens connections to the First World and long-lost fey magic, leaving the surviving creature ethereal, manic, and overflowing with the vital essence of fey. While they resemble bleachling gnomes, veins of primal, First World energy pump beneath an etioling’s pale flesh. Occasional pulses of unchecked energy crackle across their flesh and hair.

 Their transformation is hardly one of redemption. An etioling’s touch decays living flesh to fuel the supernatural furnace that rages inside them, and their bodies shake uncontrollably as the churn of primordial magic and negative energy causes tremors and muscle spasms. Focusing for more than a few moments becomes impossible, and etiolings become creatures of instinct and impulse, acting on vague memories and emotional connections. Like ghosts, they stick for days or weeks into a routine, reliving some pivotal memory and assigning familiar identities to new people they meet. Etiolings suspend not only their living functions but also their physical connection to the living world, becoming ethereal when they hold their breath.

 An etioling stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 25 pounds.
