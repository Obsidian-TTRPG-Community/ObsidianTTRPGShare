special_abilities:
  - name: Bioelectric Shield (Ex)
    desc: At will, an ekekeh can activate an electrical field generated by its body as a swift action. While the bioelectric shield is active, any creature attacking the ekekeh with a melee or natural weapon takes 3d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half). This ability can remain active indefinitely, but most ekekehs employ it only when they feel endangered; deactivating the field is a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Telekinetic Levitation (Su)
    desc: An ekekeh has the ability to float in the air, moving itself along with pure thought. This functions as air walk, but the ekekeh can move at only a quarter of its swim speed (normally 20 feet), and can never rise more than 10 feet above the ground or a structure capable of supporting its weight. It cannot climb vertical surfaces or float over water.

## Description
Ekekehs are intelligent aquatic creatures similar to dolphins, with a row of horns that runs down their backs. Filled with organic metal deposits, these horns both sense the electrical fields of living creatures and channel the ekekehs’ own energy into devastating attacks. Contemplative and fun-loving, ekekehs hold themselves up as proof that humanoids don’t have a monopoly on civilization. While at home in the open ocean, ekekehs also build grand underwater cities, working magic and employing tools via the same limited telekinetic abilities that allow them to float over dry land, where their gills process air as well as water. The slow speed and limited maneuverability of this flight strikes most ekekehs as terribly boring, if not downright embarrassing, yet it is still common for residents of coastal cities to see ekekehs floating slowly through the marketplace, their belongings stuffed into specially fitted packs or dangling from broad leather utility belts. 

An average ekekeh is 10 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds.
