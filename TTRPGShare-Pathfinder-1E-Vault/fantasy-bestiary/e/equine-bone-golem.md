The save DC is Strength-based.DescriptionAlthough bone golems are usually constructed in a humanoid shape, they can be fashioned into other forms. Among cultures that revere horses, equine bone golems are often a prized variant. Equine bone golems are constructed from the skeleton of a large horse, reinforced with bones from smaller creatures and sealed with sinew and resin. The hooves are weighted with stone or metal to deliver devastating stomp attacks.

## Description
 Equine bone golems are typically created to guard tombs or cairns of horselords or other people of high station in equestrian societies. A wealthy knight might pay to have the bones of a fallen steed fashioned into a golem to protect her crypt.particularly if the knight prefers guardians created by non.necromantic magic.or a decadent noble might choose to have his favorite racing horse entombed with him.

 Construction of an equine bone golem is the same as normal for a bone golem, except that at least one large horse skeleton must be included.
