  - name: Disturbing Vocalizations (Su)
    desc: A genghryl can emit different sounds from its lure tentacles, allowing it to mimic the barks, howls, shrieks, yips, and other noises common among burrowing mammals. Additionally, once per round as a free action, it can also use one of its tentacles to target a creature with one of two sounds, imposing either the frightened or stunned condition for 1d6 rounds unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same genghryl’s disturbing vocalizations for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lure Tentacles (Ex)
    desc: A genghryl has a number of specialized tentacles equal to half its Hit Dice. It uses these tentacles to animate and manipulate the corpses of Small or smaller creatures and to emit its disturbing vocalizations. A genghryl typically uses these tentacles to maintain the illusion that a colony of burrowing animals is alive and well, drawing in larger, predatory animals. When it uses animals’ corpses in this way, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks (in addition to its normal racial bonus). Although the genghryl can animate Small humanoids in this manner, it does not gain the additional bonus on Disguise checks when doing so. Severing a lure tentacle requires a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting the tentacle. A lure tentacle is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the genghryl’s Hit Dice (typically 16 hp). To sever a tentacle, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the tentacle’s hit points to 0 or fewer. Severing a tentacle deals an amount of damage to the genghryl’s body equal to its Hit Dice. A genghryl with no remaining lure tentacles can’t use its disturbing vocalizations.
  - name: Sinkhole (Ex)
    desc: A genghryl can cause an adjacent area of the ground above it (up to a 10-foot-by-10-foot square) to collapse, dropping any creatures in the affected squares into a 10-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save, as though they had been subjected to the effects of a pit trap. The genghryl waits adjacent to the bottom of the pit and can immediately make a single melee attack against the flat-footed AC of one creature that fell in. A creature that fails the Reflex save by 5 or more also falls prone. The save DC is Strength-based.

desc_short: A mix of burly and slender tentacles extend from the body of this large, wormlike creature. Rows of frightful fangs line the maw beneath its sharp beak.

## Description
Genghryls are subterranean, wormlike creatures that use specialized tentacles to lure and weaken their prey. Genghryls are to verdant lands what seaweed sirens are to shipping lanes or wolves-in-sheep’s-clothing are to plentiful woodlands-a menace.

A genghryl’s mottled, pinkish-brown body is about 3 feet wide at the front and tapers down to its tail, resembling a hideous segmented worm. Its head consists of a tooth-lined opening behind a sharp beak, which is surrounded by four powerful tentacles and three black eyes spaced evenly around it. A number of longer, thinner tentacles sprout from the segment just behind the genghryl’s head. The older and larger the genghryl, the more tentacles it has.

An adult genghryl weighs approximately 300 pounds.
