## Description
Unlike its smaller cousins, the giant jellyfish is an active predator that seeks out prey. Capable of slithering through narrow cracks, a giant jellyfish is a horrifying beast to encounter lurking in the hold of a flooded or sunken ship. Other species of these vermin exist, as summarized on the following table-these variants often have different types of poison or other abilities like translucency or constriction.
