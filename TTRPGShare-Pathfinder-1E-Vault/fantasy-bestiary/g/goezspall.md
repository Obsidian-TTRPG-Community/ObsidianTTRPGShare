special_abilities:
  - name: Hibernate (Ex)
    desc: Although it can live in extreme conditions, a goezspall still requires food and water. To survive when sustenance is not available, a goezspall can enter a state of hibernation at will; doing so takes 1 minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. A goezspall can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes-while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for the creature. If a goezspall is jostled or damaged while hibernating, it can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 24 hours to awaken from hibernation. A goezspall can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, a goezspall needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary.
  - name: Immune to Pressure Damage (Ex)
    desc: A goezspall can survive in extreme conditions. A goezspall is immune to damage caused by high-pressure environments such as deep underwater and low-pressure environments such as the void of space.
  - name: Scalding Spray (Su)
    desc: As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a goezspall can spray a 60-foot line of scalding water at its enemies that deals 12d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 25 half). This stream acts as a bull rush against creatures of any size. When using this ability, a goezspall attempts a combat maneuver check and applies its results to each creature within the area. This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Though rare, goezspalls have been observed living in extremely varied locations. From the frozen north to the depths of the deepest caverns, these bizarre, segmented creatures thrive in any environment, including the depths of the sea, boiling hot springs, and even, some claim, the void of space. Though not typically hostile, these omnivores hunt aggressively when hungry, especially after months or years in hibernation. A goezspall is 14 feet long and weighs 3,500 pounds, though some lore describes smaller and larger specimens.
