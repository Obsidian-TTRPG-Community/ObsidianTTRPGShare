special_abilities:
  - name: Death Touch (Su)
    desc: Creatures hit by either a grim reaper’s touch attack or by a weapon wielded by a grim reaper must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or gain 2d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based. A grim reaper can channel this ability through any weapon it wields. A humanoid slain by a reaper’s death touch is consumed in unholy fire and has its remains destroyed as the destruction spell. This is a death effect.
  - name: Summon Minor Reapers (Sp)
    desc: Three times per day, a reaper can summon 1d4 minor reapers as a standard action. Each of these minor reapers is assigned a single creature to attack, and the targeted creature must battle the minor reaper by itself. The target that the grim reaper assigns to its minor reapers need not be in sight, but it must be on the same plane on which the minor reaper was summoned. A grim reaper may only assign one minor reaper to any creature at a given time, even if it uses this ability multiple times.

## Description
Known by many names throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personifications of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state. They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life. These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves.

While grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone. The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal servitors that enact their master’s dreadful will and meet out death’s unrelenting touch. A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment. Minor reapers stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds.
