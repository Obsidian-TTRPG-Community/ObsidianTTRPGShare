## Description
Though she sees after the pack, a bouda is an unknowable and cryptic being even to gnolls who grew up with her, for arcane magic remains largely a mystery to gnolls, and most avoid it. Because a bouda’s expertise seems so alien and odd, a witch must prove her toughness before she is accepted as a revered bouda.
