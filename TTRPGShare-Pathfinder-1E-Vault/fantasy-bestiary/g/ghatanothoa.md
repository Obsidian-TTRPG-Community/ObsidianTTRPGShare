special_abilities:
  - name: Apocalyptic Dreams (Su)
    desc: Ghatanothoa can affect a creature with apocalyptic dreams if it has been subjected to his unspeakable presence (even if the creature successfully saved against that effect), has been harmed by a natural disaster created by a magical effect (such as an earthquake, storm of vengeance, or tsunami spell), or has ever offered a prayer to Ghatanothoa. When Ghatanothoa uses his nightmare spell-like ability on such a target, the victim has a vivid dream of experiencing the end of the world in a fiery, destructive apocalypse-be it from asteroid impact, devastating floods, volcanic eruption, or anything else at the GM’s whim. Upon waking, the conviction that such an apocalypse is only days, if not hours, away haunts the victim. In addition to suffering the normal effects of the nightmare, the victim must succeed at a DC 37 Will saving throw or be staggered with hopelessness for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Mummified Creature (Su)
    desc: Any creature slain by Ghatanothoa’s swallow whole attack is immediately transformed into a mummified creature (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 196) under Ghatanothoa’s control. As a free action, Ghatanothoa can disgorge any number of swallowed mummified creatures into adjacent squares. As a swift action, Ghatanothoa may make a touch attack against a creature that has mummified fully as a result of his unspeakable presence to transform that creature into a mummified creature under his control (no save).
  - name: Great Old One Traits
    desc: Full rules for Ghatanothoa’s immortality, insanity, his mythic abilities, and otherworldly insight, as well as the base rules for his unspeakable presence, can be found on page 306 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4.
  - name: Immortality (Ex)
    desc: If Ghatanothoa is killed, his form and all perfect images of his likeness lose their unspeakable presence ability (see page 85). Ghatanothoa’s body shrivels and compresses in on itself, growing hard and leathery as it mummifies and contracts in size to a Huge object with AC 24, hardness 30, and 200 hit points. These remains are immune to cold damage, take half damage from fire and electricity, and take 150% damage from acid. An earthquake manifests (as per the spell at CL 29th) each round thereafter, centered on the location where Ghatanothoa was slain (his remains never take damage from the effects of these earthquakes). If Ghatanothoa’s remains are not destroyed within 1 minute of his death, the remains explode in a blast of negative energy with a 600-foot radius that deals 20d6 points of negative energy damage to all creatures within that area (Reflex DC 43 half). A creature killed by this damage is immediately transformed into a mummified creature (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 196). If the remains are destroyed before this occurs, they crumble to dust without exploding. In either case, as soon as the remains are destroyed or explode, the earthquake effect in the region ends. Once this occurs, Ghatanothoa is reborn from one of the hidden cysts deep within his island lair. If his remains were destroyed before they could explode, he stays dormant in his lair until outside influences awake him once again (this could be a complex ritual performed by cultists, an astronomical event, or any natural disaster that strikes the region). If his remains were allowed to explode, Ghatanothoa wakes immediately and his unspeakable presence ability once again functions as detailed below. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Overwhelming Devastation (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, Ghatanothoa can assault a structure, dealing 10d6+31 points of damage to the structure in that round. This damage bypasses all hardness the structure has.
  - name: Unspeakable Presence (Su)
    desc: Any creature failing a DC 39 Will save against Ghatanothoa’s unspeakable presence becomes afflicted with a horrific curse. Ghatanothoa’s unspeakable presence is so potent that even perfect images of the Great Old One can have this effect-a “perfect image” can either be a projected image created by Ghatanothoa, a perfectly rendered statue or painting (this requires an expenditure of 100,000 gp in resources, a successful DC 50 Craft [painting or sculpture] check, and a wish by someone who has suffered from Ghatanothoa’s unspeakable presence), or any other representation at the GM’s whim. Fortunately, the saving throw to resist this effect from a “perfect image” is only DC 20 (DC = 10 + Ghatanothoa’s Charisma modifier).

 If a creature fails to resist this curse, it immediately takes 1d10 points of Dexterity drain per round as its body begins to swiftly mummify. If the creature averts its gaze from Ghatanothoa, this drain is reduced to 1 point per round. As soon as a creature’s Dexterity score is drained to 0, it transforms into a perfectly preserved and completely immobile mummy, yet the victim does not die. A creature mummified in this way no longer needs to eat, drink, or breathe, and no longer ages. It is essentially immortal, and can observe the world around it (and may even take purely mental actions, including the use of psychic magic), but can take no other actions. No magical effect can end this condition (even if the victim’s Dexterity drain is healed) save for an effect that removes the curse. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Ghatanothoa is a horrific monstrosity who, fortunately, is imprisoned on an island on a distant world. Yet even an image of this Great Old One has the potential to wreak havoc and destroy lives. Ghatanothoa’s form is singularly repulsive-a tangle of arms, legs, eyes, mouths, and other body parts capable of shifting its composition at a whim, yet always retaining a definite and abhorrent shape.
