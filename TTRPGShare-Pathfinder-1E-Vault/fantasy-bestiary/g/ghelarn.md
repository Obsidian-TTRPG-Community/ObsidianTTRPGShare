special_abilities:
  - name: Carapace (Ex)
    desc: A ghelarn typically shelters within a hardened, rocklike shell that houses all of its vital organs. By withdrawing its tentacles and sensory stalks into its shell, the ghelarn gains total cover until the beginning of its next turn. The shell doesn’t provide cover against targeted spells, and the ghelarn’s movement is limited to downward burrowing during this time. The benefits of the shell can be lost if sundered (hardness 5, 8 hit points, regenerates in 2d6 days), and a ghelarn caught without its carapace loses its natural armor bonus.
  - name: Entrap (Ex)
    desc: A ghelarn secretes a quagmire of sticky fluid a few feet below the sand where it lives. This fluid extends in a 10-foot radius around the creature and acts to trap victims, making it easier for the ghelarn to attack prey with its tentacles or feed upon it with its leeching tendrils. This otherwise acts as the entrap universal monster rule.
  - name: Hibernate (Ex)
    desc: When food is scarce, a ghelarn can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time. When it enters hibernation, the ghelarn nestles itself in the sand and fills in its porous carapace with sticky excretions that quickly harden to seal the creature from the elements. When hibernating, the ghelarn doesn’t have to eat or drink. A ghelarn remains in a state of hibernation until it senses another living creature within 10 feet, at which point it dissolves the seals on its carapace over the course of 1d4 minutes.
  - name: Leeching Tendrils (Ex)
    desc: A living creature that spends more than a single round ensnared within a ghelarn’s entrapping fluid becomes targeted by invasive tendrils from the ghelarn’s lower body. These feeding stalks deal 1 point of bleed damage each round, and continue to do so for as long as a victim remains within the area of the ghelarn’s entrapping fluid.

## Description
Born on the desert plain of an alien world, the softbodied ghelarn is a non-aquatic arthropod living within a shell-like exoskeleton manufactured from its own hardened secretions. This outer carapace contains many perforations, similar to dry coral or air-blasted stone, providing ample room from which the ghelarn can extend its outer extremities and explore the world. Chief among these appendages are two main tentacles that it uses to pull itself through the upper layers of sand within its native home, burrowing just below the surface while its hardened carapace remains above ground. As a result, ghelarns give the impression of ambulatory stone formations when traveling, but they can also abandon their shells entirely and delve deeper into the sand to avoid predators.

Patient, quiet creatures, ghelarns prefer to ambush prey, waiting until suitable meals wander within reach of their tentacles or into the sticky quagmires they create just below the surface around their nesting grounds. Helpless victims soon find themselves pulled into the sand as the ghelarn extends invasive tendrils from its lower body. These lesser tentacles slowly bleed away moisture from anyone trapped in the ooze, leaving behind little more than dried husks and bones for scavengers to find, along with whatever equipment such victims may have carried.
