special_abilities:
  - name: Baleful Gust (Su)
    desc: Three times per day as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunities, a gale spirit can whip the wind around it into a terrible, howling gust. This baleful gust lasts for 1 round, and creatures and objects within a 15-foot radius of the gale spirit are affected as if by a gust of wind. Additionally, when the gust begins, the howling winds deal 4d6 points of sonic damage to creatures in the area. A successful DC 18 Fortitude save negates the gust of wind effect and reduces the sonic damage by half. The gale spirit is immune to this ability’s effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    desc: A humanoid slain by a gale spirit becomes a gale spirit in 1d4 rounds. These spawn are less powerful than typical gale spirits, and take a -2 penalty on d20 rolls and checks, have 2 fewer hit points per Hit Die, and only deal 1d6 points of negative energy damage. Spawn are under the command of the gale spirit that created them until its destruction, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become freewilled gale spirits. They do not have any of the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    desc: A gale spirit notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    desc: Animals don’t willingly approach within 30 feet of a gale spirit, unless their master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.

## Description
Gale spirits are the remnants of wicked individuals who have fallen a great distance through the air-usually from bridges or mountainsides-and died alone, broken on the ground, while cursing the world for leaving them to their terrible demise. These malicious creatures haunt the places of their deaths, hungrily seeking victims with whom they can share their fate. Although they are not typically friendly with any creatures, even others of their kind, gale spirits do occasionally work with each other in combat; the result is often a terrible, haunted place of howling winds and spooky terrain that is as unnerving as it is deadly.

Gale spirits resemble 2-foot-tall, disembodied heads with twisted features that are eerily similar to those the creatures had in life.
