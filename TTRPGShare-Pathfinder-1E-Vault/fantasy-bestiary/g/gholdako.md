## Description
A gholdako is a dreadful undead cyclops created by the foul priests and necromancers of a fallen cyclops empire thousands of years ago. A gholdako’s single eyeball is sunken and milky, and its body and limbs are wrapped tightly in ragged strips of soiled and moldering linens, much like those of a mummy, but with disturbing and incomprehensible glyphs scribbled on the ancient cloth, written in what appears to be dried blood. Layers of skin continually flake off the hideous monster’s parched flesh wherever it is exposed, falling in papery strips of sickly pale yellow. The average gholdako stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.

Gholdakos are nearly always guardians of some special relic or tomb, having been ordered to protect the object or location in life and remaining faithful to their duties even after dying. While they strive to keep their wards safe from depredations, gholdakos are nonetheless short-tempered and easy to lure away from their posts-though being caught by one of these undead giants almost always spells a gruesome and untimely end for most would-be .

Dread Gholdako (+1 CR): Some gholdakos were created to guard the tombs of royalty. Such dread gholdakos possess a bluish-white halo of smoke around their perpetually peeling scalps. A dread gholdako generally possesses additional Hit Dice, and can inflict paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 10 + 1/2 the dread gholdako’s racial Hit Dice + the dread gholdako’s Constitution modifier) on its foes with its bite attack.
