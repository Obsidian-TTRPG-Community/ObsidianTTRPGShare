## Description
Though great horned owls seem large, most of their apparent bulk comes from their particularly fluffy feathers and rather large heads. Great horned owls have wingspans of up to 5 feet and weigh up to 4 pounds.

Great horned owls primarily hunt at night, locating prey through their excellent hearing. Their diet consists of rodents supplemented by smaller birds and rabbits.
