## Description
In the border areas between the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire, volcanoes and continent-sized lava flows are commonplace. Elementals in this area tend to have aspects of both planes, and the typical sort is the magma elemental, an earth elemental with a core of liquid fire. Magma elementals generally have a somewhat feral or bestial appearance.
