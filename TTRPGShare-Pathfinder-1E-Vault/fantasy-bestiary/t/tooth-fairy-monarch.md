special_abilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    desc: When a tooth fairy monarch is slain, it explodes into a cloud of chattering, biting motes that deals 3d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst and imparts the dazzled condition to them for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 14 Fortitude save takes half this damage and is dazzled for 1 round. A tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed by this explosion, but its other gear is unaffected. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Scepter (Su)
    desc: Each tooth fairy monarch owns a heavy scepter of wood, scrap metal, and twine. In the hands of a tooth fairy monarch, the scepter functions as a +1 morningstar. Any loose tooth the tooth fairy monarch touches to the scepter remains firmly adhered to it, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check to remove, although a tooth fairy monarch can pluck a tooth from its scepter automatically with its tooth eater ability. The scepter has hardness 10 and 15 hit points. If a tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed, all attached teeth fall free and the tooth fairy monarch is staggered until it can create another one, which requires 1 hour of work and a small amount of junk. Although a scepter can hold dozens of teeth, a tooth fairy monarch usually has only 1d6 teeth attached to its scepter when encountered.
  - name: Tooth Eater (Su)
    desc: Using its sinuous tongue, a tooth fairy monarch can grab and consume an unattached tooth within 5 feet as a move action, so long as the tooth is unattended or in its possession (such as attached to its scepter). The tooth fairy monarch regains a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice (5 hit points for most tooth fairy monarchs), gains nourishment as though it had eaten a full meal, and recovers the use of one of its expended daily spell-like abilities of its choice (if any).

desc_short: Resembling a gaunt humanoid from the waist up and a fleshy insect from the waist down, this child-sized creature has enormous black eyes and a large jaw with a lolling tongue. It wears a crown made of humanoid teeth and clutches a tooth-studded scepter.

## Description
The rare and reclusive leaders of clans of tooth fairies, tooth fairy monarchs rule their smaller, lesser kin with imperious commands and domineering bluster. These monarchs collect the teeth pulled by the lesser tooth fairies as tribute, affixing the teeth to their magical scepters or forming them into simple jewelry such as crowns, bracelets, or necklaces. A monarch can consume these teeth to gain a burst of supernatural nourishment. They find teeth of large, powerful creatures to be tastier than those of children or smaller creatures (such as other tooth fairies), but they will command their tooth fairy minions to offer up their own teeth for consumption as punishment for failure, or simply to remind onlookers of their authority.

 In combat, a tooth fairy monarch prefers to hold back behind a screen of tooth fairies, exhorting their minions to attack. Monarchs use their spell-like abilities to distract and debilitate foes while directing their minions to pull their enemies' teeth. Tooth fairies bring these teeth to the monarch, even in the middle of a fight, so the monarch can consume them on the spot or stick them to their scepters for later consumption. Fundamentally cowardly, a tooth fairy monarch encountered on its own usually attempts to flee using lies or magical trickery.

 A tooth fairy monarch stands 3 feet high and weighs about 30 pounds.
