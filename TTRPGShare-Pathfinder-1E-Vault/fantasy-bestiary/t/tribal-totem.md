special_abilities:
  - name: Ceremonial Activation (Su)
    desc: A tribal totem stands inert unless empowered each day by spiritual energy. This activation requires that at least 10 participants perform an hour-long ceremony of chanting and adoration. For each hour this ritual lasts, the totem remains alert and functional for 1 day. The worshipers need not include the creator or possess any special divine powers.
  - name: Effigy (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action once per day, a tribal totem can mimic the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid within its line of sight, reforming itself into a wooden depiction of that creature. Upon doing so, the target can be affected by the effigy ability. While in this shape, the tribal totem knows the location of its target as if persistently using the spell locate creature. A warp wood or wood shape spell immediately forces the tribal totem to revert to its normal form. Although the tribal totem may only use this ability once per day, it can retain a shape indefinitely.
  - name: Mouthpiece (Sp)
    desc: Although a tribal totem cannot speak on its own, every day it can store a single message for its creator and repeat that message upon a prescribed condition. This ability functions as the magic mouth spell, and its creator may change or reset the conditions of the message each day.
  - name: Spirit Link (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a tribal totem may attempt to join its animating energies with a creature within its line of sight that also shares its likeness (as per the effigy ability). The target can resist this effect with a DC 16 Will save. If this save fails, the target is affected as if it had cast the spell shield other, taking half the damage inflicted upon the tribal totem. In addition, any spell with a range of “creature touched” cast upon the tribal totem affects the linked creature rather than the construct. If the spell allows a saving throw, the linked creature can make a saving throw as normal to resist the effect. Spirit link lasts for 4 hours and ends immediately if the tribal totem no longer possesses the target’s shape. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    desc: 86
desc_short: With the splintering sound of dry, cracking wood, a human-sized graven image lurches to life. Its features shift and reform with every step, cycling through a variety of faces both strange and oddly familiar. Bits of feather, leaves, and decorative stone embellish its surface, and the strong smell of lacquer and resin assaults the senses as it draws near with a menacing, ponderous gait.

## Description
Tribal totems represent a significant cultural achievement for their adopted tribe. Imbued with a spark of life from the continued worship of those they protect, they stand as lifelong guardians of their villages, defending them against enemies and predators alike. To aid them in this function, they also possess the unusual ability to reshape themselves into the likeness of other creatures, targeting them with eerie pains and ailments. This ability enables their tribe to more actively hunt down such enemies while their quarry is hindered and tracked by the totem.

As mindless automatons, tribal totems remain ever dependent on their creators to direct them. Some serve only a defensive role, strategically placed within villages to aid against attacks. Others carry stored messages on their tribe’s behalf or vocalize their creator’s words. Rarer still are the tribal totems purposed for war, which emerge from the jungle as a potent force capable of spearheading invasions and targeting enemy champions.

While most tribal totems are made of wood and combine exaggerated features of folkloric monsters with simple decorations and images of strength (like streaks of blood, the claws of defeated beasts, or enemy skulls), few look exactly alike, as each embodies the deities, fears, or legends of its creator’s people. Tribal totems tend to stand 7 feet tall and weigh over 300 pounds.
