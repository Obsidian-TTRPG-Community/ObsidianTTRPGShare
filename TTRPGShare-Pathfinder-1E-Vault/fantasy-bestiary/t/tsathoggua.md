    desc: triple
special_abilities:
  - name: Adaptive Spellcasting (Su)
    desc: Tsathoggua has mastered all forms of magic, be they arcane, divine, or psychic. He casts spells spontaneously, as per a sorcerer, but he can cast spells from any spell list. He can know up to two spells per spell level from 1st to 9th at any one time (and up to six 0-level spells at any one time), taken from any spell list. When he uses his consume spellcaster ability, he can swap out up to two spells currently known for any two spells known (and currently prepared in the case of prepared spellcasters) by his consumed victim. The only spells Tsathoggua can never know are those with the good or lawful descriptors. The spells listed above are those he favors, but GMs are free to alter that list as they wish for encounters with Tsathoggua.
  - name: Consume Spellcaster (Su)
    desc: When Tsathoggua kills a spellcaster while using his feed ability, the spellcaster’s body shrivels into what appears to be a long-dead mummified corpse. Tsathoggua can learn any two spells known by the spellcaster (see adaptive spellcasting above) when he kills a spellcaster in this way, and he regains a number of hit points equal to the total number of spell levels still uncast by the consumed victim.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    desc: Once every hour as a standard action, Tsathoggua can emit 1d4 formless spawn from his body. These newly created formless spawn have free will and are fully grown, but they follow Tsathoggua’s commands for 1d4 days after creation. Tsathoggua sometimes gifts newly created spawn to visitors he favors. Sometimes he just eats them. Those spawn that escape servitude or digestion slither off into the world on their own.
  - name: Feed (Su)
    desc: Whenever Tsathoggua deals bite damage to a creature, he drinks away vital essence, sanity, and bodily fluids alike. This causes 1d4 points of ability drain to all six ability scores. A successful DC 44 Fortitude saving throw reduces the 1d4 points of ability drain to only one ability score, chosen by Tsathoggua. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Great Old One Traits
    desc: Rules for Tsathoggua’s Great Old One traits such as immortality, insanity, his mythic abilities, otherworldly insight, and unspeakable presence can be found on page 306 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4.
  - name: Immortality (Su)
    desc: If Tsathoggua is slain, his body tears open and creates a burst of vile ooze that deals 20d8 points of acid damage to all creatures within a 60-foot spread. A total of 2d6 formless spawn immediately form in random spots throughout this area of effect, while the remainder of the gore seeps into the ground, reforming into Tsathoggua in a deep cavern on another world after 1d100 months have passed. All portals in Tsathoggua’s domain that connect to the world on which he was slain deactivate and must be manually repaired by the Great Old One, a process that can take years or even decades but does not bar his return to that world via other means.
  - name: Item Creation (Su)
    desc: Tsathoggua is treated as having all item creation feats for the purposes of crafting magic items.
  - name: Outcast’s Dreams (Su)
    desc: Tsathoggua can affect any creature with outcast’s dreams that has succumbed to the Great Old One’s unspeakable presence or that has ever offered him prayer or physically touched an altar dedicated to him within the walls of a still-standing temple of Tsathoggua. When Tsathoggua uses nightmare on such a target, the victim must also succeed at a DC 38 Will saving throw or feel cast out of society and spurned by friends and loved ones. The victim cannot benefit from the aid another action or provide aid to others, it must always attempt saving throws against beneficial spell effects if saving throws are allowed, and it takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks when any other creature of its type is within 30 feet of it. This is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    desc: Tsathoggua’s bite and claw attacks always apply 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier to damage.
  - name: Unspeakable Presence (Su)
    desc: Failing a DC 38 Will saving throw against Tsathoggua’s unspeakable presence causes the victim to perceive Tsathoggua as its only ally; it treats all other creatures as enemies and does what it can to defend Tsathoggua and obey the Great Old One’s commands, as if under the effects of dominate monster. This effect persists for as long as the victim remains within 300 feet of Tsathoggua. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Known variously to his worshipers as the Father of Night, Saint Toad, the Sleeper in the Deep, and other appellations, Tsathoggua is among the more enigmatic of the Great Old Ones. Not only does he often interact with mortal life, but he has at times done so in a friendly or even charitable manner. Yet these moods are mercurial, and the Great Old One tires of company and attempts to eat those he had been aiding only a moment before. Those who worship him generally do not display this level of magnanimity; they are typically fanatic and violent in their methods of preserving the secrets of their sect.

Tsathoggua appears as a bloated toadlike creature, covered with fur and wearing a strange, sleepy expression on his bat-like face.
