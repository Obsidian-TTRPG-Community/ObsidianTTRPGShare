special_abilities:
  - name: Blind
    desc: A tikoloshe has no eyes and is blind. All creatures beyond the range of its hearing-based blindsense and blindsight abilities have total concealment against it.
  - name: Trickster’s Torment (Su)
    desc: Once per day, a tikoloshe can curse another living creature. As a standard action, the tikoloshe makes a melee touch attack and unless the target makes a DC 15 Will save, the target is treated as if under the effect of bestow curse, except that the curse’s duration is only 24 hours. A creature can only suffer from one tikoloshe’s curse at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Water Diffusion (Ex)
    desc: When in water at least 2 feet deep, a tikoloshe’s body seems to diffuse into and become part of the water, granting it concealment (20% miss chance) as if under the effect of blur. This effect ends immediately upon entering shallower water or setting foot on land.
  - name: Waverider (Ex)
    desc: Up to 3 times per day, a tikoloshe can swim up to 30 feet as a swift action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity for this movement.

desc_short: The water churns and splashes as a small, stocky humanoid surges forth, gnashing rows of needle-like teeth, its eye sockets merely deep gouges. As if it were one with the water itself, it darts quickly forward, shouting curses and swinging its fists.

## Description
Cruel and spiteful, tikoloshe (singular and plural) are small undead that haunt tropical waterways and jungles, preying on travelers and villagers alike with their magical abilities and appetite for harm. Tikoloshe stand no higher than a gnome or a human child, but their bodies are dense and muscular; many have large potbellies and arms long enough for their knuckles to score the dirt as they walk. Their creation leaves them with blackened, eyeless sockets, but tikoloshe can “see” using their giant, bat-like ears. Their skin is smooth and shines whether wet or dry. Tikoloshe are genderless; they stand about 4 feet tall and weigh almost 150 pounds.
