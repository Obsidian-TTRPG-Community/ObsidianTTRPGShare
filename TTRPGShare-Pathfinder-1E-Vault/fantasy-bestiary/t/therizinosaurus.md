## Description
At first glance, this dinosaur’s massive claws may well convince observers that it is a predator, but the therizinosaurus is in fact an omnivore. Nonetheless, the therizinosaurus has a foul temper and is both easily angered and difficult to spook. With its deep-cutting claws, the therizinosaurus is more than a match for even the mightiest of predatory dinosaurs. A therizinosaurus is 35 feet long and weighs 13,000 pounds.
