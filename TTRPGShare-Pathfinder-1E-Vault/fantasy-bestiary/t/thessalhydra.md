special_abilities:
  - name: Acid Spit (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a thessalhydra can spit acid from its eight snake mouths, making eight ranged touch attacks at any number of targets within a range of 120 feet. On a hit, an acid spit deals 2d6 points of acid damage. A creature hit by multiple acid spits from a single thessalhydra in 1 round takes the damage as if from one source for the purposes of applying acid resistance. For example, a creature hit by eight acid spits would take 16d6 points of acid damage, not 2d6 points of acid damage eight times. A creature critically hit by acid spit must succeed at a DC 31 Reflex save to avoid being blinded for 1 round by the acid. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Snake Bite (Ex)
    desc: A thessalhydra’s serpent heads strike as secondary attacks that deal piercing and slashing damage plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage.

desc_short: This four-legged reptile has eight serpentine heads arrayed around a central maw. Its long, thrashing tail ends in a crab-like pincer.

## Description
The dreaded thessalhydra is a fearsome predator that has an unexpected agility. Despite its lumbering shape and looming size, the monster’s nimbleness makes it almost beautiful as it attacks. Thessalhydras are relatively rare, though their notorious speed and savagery have featured in countless legends. They are often whispered of in fear and awe by willful children in rural areas, whose exasperated parents have warned them to “be good, or the thessalhydra will pluck you out of your bed through the window when you sleep!” 

A thessalhydra is 40 feet long, with its pincer-tipped tail adding another 30 feet to its overall length.
