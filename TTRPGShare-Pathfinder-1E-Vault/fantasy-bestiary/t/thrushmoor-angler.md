special_abilities:
  - name: Projected Victim (Su)
    desc: A Thrushmoor angler can project an illusory image of the last humanoid victim it consumed in order to lure additional prey into its jaws. This ability functions as project image using the Thrushmoor angler’s Hit Die as its caster level, differing in that the Thrushmoor angler can produce only an image of its last consumed victim with that victim’s voice, it does not require line of effect, and it can project the image a maximum of 200 feet from itself. Creatures interacting with the projected victim can recognize the illusion with a successful DC 20 Will saving throw. Should the Thrushmoor angler then consume another victim, any subsequent use of its projected victim ability replicates the appearance of this most recent victim. The Thrushmoor angler can communicate through its projected victim with its own language or those known by the represented victim. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    desc: A Thrushmoor angler can unhinge its jaws and partially distend its barbed esophagus, allowing it to swallow creatures of up to Medium size.
  - name: Tantalizing Lure (Su)
    desc: A Thrushmoor angler can lure prey toward it with powerful compulsions. All humanoids within 60 feet and with line of sight to the Thrushmoor angler must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or be fascinated and compelled to take no other action than to approach the Thrushmoor angler each round until attacked. A target that succeeds at its saving throw or breaks free of the fascination effect cannot be subject to the same Thrushmoor angler’s tantalizing lure for 24 hours. A Thrushmoor angler can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
The Thrushmoor angler, named for the Ustalavic town of Thrushmoor around which it can be commonly found, is a bizarre and voracious semiaquatic predator. Preferring to feed on intelligent humanoids, it lurks at the edges of swamps and by marshy riverbanks, using an illusory lure that assumes the form and even the voice of past meals to draw hapless victims into its massive jaws.

At home in deep water and only partially adapted for land, the angler resembles a great, human-sized deep-ocean fish with mottled, slimy skin. The creature’s flesh exudes a thick coating of slime, allowing its awkward, bulky body to slide with relative speed through underbrush and along drier surfaces, propelling itself forward by the combined action of multiple powerful but misshapen limbs.

A female Thrushmoor angler is typically 5 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. Males of the species generally grow no larger than 1 foot in length and weigh less than 30 pounds.
