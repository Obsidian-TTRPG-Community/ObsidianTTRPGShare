special_abilities:
  - name: Alluring Scent (Ex)
    desc: The Menotherian’s subtle aroma causes creatures in her vicinity to become placid and react favorably toward her. Any creature that fails a DC 25 Fortitude save against the aura improves its attitude toward the Menotherian one step closer to friendly. Creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on this saving throw. Creatures in the aura must attempt a saving throw each minute. This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    desc: Once per day, the Menotherian can implant eggs in a creature using its sting. The creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist implantation. The target is nauseated for the next 2d4 rounds while the eggs gestate. When the eggs hatch, they form a chaotic neutral hellwasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 146), kill the host in 1 round, and inhabit the corpse. The eggs can be surgically removed with a successful DC 30 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of success) or by remove disease or similar spells. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Mind Control (Ex)
    desc: The menotherian can inject its scent into the brain of a helpless or willing target, controlling it for the next 24 hours (as the spell dominate person, Fortitude DC 25 negates), although the Menotherian must verbally give the target instructions. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Sting-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

## Description
The Menotherian is a personification of lust and vengeance. Bereft of morals, she seduces, tricks, or murders any creature necessary to complete whatever mission Calistria sends her to upon. The herald stands 14 feet tall, has a wingspan nearing 30 feet, and weighs 1,400 pounds.
