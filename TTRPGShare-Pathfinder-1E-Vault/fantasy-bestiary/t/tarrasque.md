## Description
The Tarrasque, referred to in ancient texts as the “Armageddon Engine,” is the greatest of Rovagug’s spawn. Its previously recorded devastation of Ninshabur and Avistan occurred in -632 AR, and culminated in the destruction of the flying Shory city of Kho. It was sealed away in a cavern somewhere in the Inner Sea region. Although the location of this cavern has been lost, rumors of possible locations include nearly every mountainous region, the Mwangi Expanse, and even under the Isle of Kortos itself.

The statistics presented here for the Tarrasque differ slightly from those in the Bestiary-this version more accurately represents the Tarrasque as the mightiest of Rovagug’s spawn.
