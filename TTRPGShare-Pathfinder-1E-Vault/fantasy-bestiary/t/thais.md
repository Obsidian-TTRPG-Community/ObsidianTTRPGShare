## Description
Cayden Cailean’s herald Thais is a personification of freedom and courage. She typically appears as a 15-foot-tall, angelic woman, but can change her size to be anywhere from 4 feet to 32 feet tall. She is always portrayed carrying her signature weapon, a crystalline halberd called Tyranny’s Foil borrowed from Milani’s armory. Three times per day as a standard action, she can use the weapon to open all nonmagical doors and break all nonmagical chains within 30 feet.
