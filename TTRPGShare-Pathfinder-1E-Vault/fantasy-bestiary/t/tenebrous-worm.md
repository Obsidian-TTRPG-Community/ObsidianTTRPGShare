special_abilities:
  - name: Acid (Su)
    desc: The acid of a tenebrous worm’s bite affects only organic matter-as it dissolves creatures, it converts their flesh to shadow that swiftly fades away, leaving raw, jagged wounds behind. In dim light, acid damage dealt by a tenebrous worm’s bite increases to 8d6 points of damage, while in darkness or bright light, the acid damage is reduced to 4d6.
  - name: Bristles (Su)
    desc: Long bristles of shadowstuff extend from between the tenebrous worm’s armor plates. These bristles react swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature that attempts to harm the worm. Each time a creature attacks a tenebrous worm, it must make a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid being punctured by several bristles. Each time a creature is punctured by these bristles, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the tenebrous worm’s poison. A creature that grapples a tenebrous worm is automatically hurt by these bristles. The save DC to avoid the bristles is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Poison (Su)
    desc: Bristles-injury; save Fort DC 20, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect paralysis for 1d4 rounds plus 1d2 Con (the duration of the paralysis is cumulative with each failed save), cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
The caterpillar-like tenebrous worm is a voracious predator that hungers for mortal flesh. The tenebrous worm is the larval stage of the gloomwing (see page 133)-but in a strange reversal, these younger creatures are more dangerous than the adults they grow into. A native of the Plane of Shadow, a tenebrous worm hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has been implanted with an egg by a gloomwing. The tenebrous worm is fully grown upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to consume.

Although the tenebrous worm tends to be relatively pale-colored, its internal organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming strange bristle-like filaments of semisolid shadowstuff not only capable of piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a deadly paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the worm’s mandibles-when it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows that the creature can then consume. When a tenebrous worm feeds on enough of this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area (typically just within a cave entrance or in a ruined building) and spins a shadowy cocoon around itself. A tenebrous worm’s cocoon exudes the effects of a darkness spell (CL 8th), muting the surrounding light. After a period of several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown gloomwing emerges, ready to seek a host for its eggs.
