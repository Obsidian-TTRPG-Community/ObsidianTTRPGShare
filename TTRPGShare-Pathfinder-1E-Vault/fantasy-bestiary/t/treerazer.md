special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Corruption (Su)
    desc: Treerazer exudes an aura of corruption to a radius of 120 feet. This aura causes plants to grow hideous, sprouting thorns, twisting, and becoming fungoid in nature. Creatures with woodland stride or freedom of movement can move through this fungal bloom with ease. Living creatures within Treerazer’s aura of corruption must make a DC 39 Fortitude save each round or their flesh grows pasty and clammy as tendrils of diseased plant matter and fungal growth sprout from it. This condition persists as long as the creature remains within Treerazer’s aura of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter. While suffering the effects of this aura, the living creature is treated as a plant for the purposes of spells and effects that harm or otherwise inconvenience plant creatures more than other creatures. The victim would thus be subject to antiplant shell, blight, and additional damage from horrid wilting or a plant bane weapon, and could be affected by control plants. The corruption does not otherwise impart plant traits to creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Defoliation (Su)
    desc: As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Treerazer can exude a pulse of defoliating energy in a 30-foot-radius spread. This pulse appears as a wave of sickly green energy, and causes all plants and plant creatures in the area to blacken and wither. Such creatures take 20d10 points of damage and 1d8 points of Strength drain, or half with a successful DC 39 Fortitude save. A plant that isn’t a creature (such as a tree or a shrub) doesn’t receive a save and immediately withers and dies. Treerazer can choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this effect, and generally does so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants and fungus. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Nascent Demon Lord Traits
    desc: A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. Treerazer’s current exile to the Material Plane prevents him from achieving full demon lord status. Yet he still possesses the typical nascent demon lord traits, which are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent, as summarized here.Immunity to death effects, electricity, charm and compulsion effects, and poison.Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.Summon (Sp) Once per day, nascent demon lords can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.Telepathy 300 ft.A nascent demon lord’s natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction.Nascent demon lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the nascent demon lord’s behalf. All nascent demon lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil-in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to the nascent demon lord’s themes and interests.

## Description
Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, was once the favored minion and lieutenant (some even say child) of Cyth-V’sug, Demon Lord of Fungus and Parasites. After a failed attempt to wrest that crown away from Cyth-V’sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V’sug was unable (or perhaps only unwilling) to pursue, but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, transforming Treerazer into a native outsider and severing his bond to the Abyss-if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform. Death, to Treerazer, is a permanent thing.

Treerazer arrived on Golarion near the end of the Age of Darkness, and found the savaged planet much to his liking-so much so that the sting of exile was somewhat ameliorated. He spent many centuries wandering the remote corners of Golarion before finally coming upon the abandoned elven nation of Kyonin in 2497 ar. In the Sovyrian Stone, he found an artifact that he believed he could use to reinstate his Abyssal link and, perhaps, even uproot the entire nation and refocus the portal from Sovyrian to the Abyss, thereby reclaiming his position there and taking one more step toward revenge against Cyth-V’sug. Yet the elves sensed his tamperings and returned to confront the demon. A terrific battle resulted, and while the elves were able to drive Treerazer out of Iadara and into southern Kyonin, they were unable to slay him or force him out completely-they merely concentrated his power in a smaller region. Instead, the elves “walled off ” this region, a perverted realm known today as the Tanglebriar. Treerazer lurks at the Tanglebriar’s heart to this day, the greatest bogeyman in elven mythology and a very real and constant threat to the nation’s security.

Treerazer begins most combats by casting time stop and raising an antiplant shell to prevent plant creatures (including creatures under the effect of his aura of corruption) from approaching. If he has time, he also creates walls of thorns and summons demons (usually four nalfeshnees and 12 hezrous). In melee, Treerazer gleefully takes up Blackaxe and makes full attacks against the closest foe, or Greater Vital Strikes if he’s forced to move or charge. During the first 3 rounds of combat, he targets obvious spell effects with quickened greater dispel magic. If Treerazer is reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he teleports back to his fortress, Witchbole, to recover and plan his revenge.
