special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Insolence (Su)
    desc: Any creature adjacent to a thoxel demon must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become insolent and uncooperative with its allies. Creatures affected by this aura stop functioning as allies to other creatures. An affected creature can’t provide flanking, can’t serve as an ally for teamwork feats or aid another actions, and doesn’t allow its allies to move through its space. Any spell or effect that requires a willing target fails if it is used on an affected creature, and even harmless effects require an attack roll (if applicable) and require the insolent creature to attempt a saving throw against them. An affected creature remains insolent as long as it is adjacent to a thoxel demon and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same thoxel’s aura for 24 hours. Thoxel demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Betrayer’s Blade (Su)
    desc: If a thoxel demon hits a creature with both ends of its two-bladed sword in the same round, the target is compelled to attack its leader. The target can negate this effect with a successful DC 15 Will save. A creature affected by this effect turns on its leader or commander and attacks as if it were dominated for 1d6 rounds. An animal companion, cohort, or familiar must attack its master, and a called, charmed, dominated, or summoned creature must attack the creature controlling it. If a creature has no leader, it instead attacks a random ally. This is a mindaffecting compulsion effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Disrupt Coordination (Su)
    desc: Whenever a creature threatened by a thoxel demon uses the aid another action, the thoxel can, as an immediate action, attempt to interrupt and negate that action. The thoxel demon must make an attack roll. The attack roll of the creature performing the aid another action must equal or exceed the thoxel demon’s attack roll; otherwise, the aid another action is negated.

## Description
Able to take the shape of rank-and-file soldiers and infect military ranks like a cancer, thoxels-also known as insubordination demons-spend every drop of their malice to break down the cooperative spirit of those who fight together. Among mortal soldiers, thoxels whisper disparaging words about commanders, talk in hushed tones about the danger of upcoming battles, or belittle other soldiers’ accomplishments. Many great battles are said to have been lost because of the presence of these subtle but murderous demons within an army’s ranks. They represent a passion to kill as they please without caring about order, control, or their allies. Despite their skill at martial exploits, thoxels are lazy and untrustworthy creatures. Thoxel demons are 6 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.
