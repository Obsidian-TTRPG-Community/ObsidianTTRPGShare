special_abilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    desc: An Ardoc moilant explodes when it is destroyed, unless its master is within 30 feet at the moment of its destruction. When it explodes, creatures within 30 feet of it take 13d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 16 half). Half of this damage is fire and half is piercing. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Loyal Servant (Su)
    desc: The Spellcraft DC to wrest or maintain control of an Ardoc moilant using control construct or similar magic is increased by 10 for anyone other than the moilant’s master. Whenever an attempt to wrest control of the moilant fails, the moilant gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour, to a maximum of 30 temporary hit points.
  - name: Resounding Burst (Su)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, an Ardoc moilant can snap its vise-pincers closed with enough force to produce a shock wave of sound and disruptive magic in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. The moilant attempts a single bull rush combat maneuver check and applies the result to each creature in the affected area. A creature pushed by the shock wave takes 2d6 points of sonic damage for every 5 feet it is pushed. In addition, the wave dispels magic in the area as per greater dispel magic (CL 13th). An Ardoc moilant cannot use this ability if it is grappling a creature with its vise-pincers.
  - name: Shovelhead (Ex)
    desc: The serrated edge of an Ardoc moilant’s shovel-like head is viciously sharp. It applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its gore attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. As a full-round action, an Ardoc moilant can use its head to excavate and move earth, dust, or sand up to the size of a 5-foot cube (as per the spell expeditious excavation).
  - name: Stable Footing (Ex)
    desc: The weight and sturdiness of its form grants an Ardoc moilant a +2 racial bonus to its CMD versus bull rush and reposition combat maneuver checks.
  - name: Thaumaturgical Field (Su)
    desc: An Ardoc moilant’s spell resistance is powerful but fragile. If a spell of at least 3rd level fails to penetrate the moilant’s spell resistance, it loses its spell resistance for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Vise-Pincers (Ex)
    desc: An Ardoc moilant’s vise-pincers are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and piercing damage. Attacks that the moilant makes with its vise-pincers ignore the hardness of objects with a hardness of 15 or less. When an Ardoc moilant successfully establishes or maintains a pin, it applies its constrict damage to both the target and the target’s armor or shield (Ardoc moilant’s choice).

    desc: 84
desc_short: This massive metallic biped stands on thick legs. A wide, serrated shovel serves as the brute’s head, and iron pincers at the ends of its powerful arms snap open and shut.

## Description
Ardoc moilants are hulking thaumaturgical workhorses created to move earth or perform other heavy labor. Efficient and powerful in their movements, Ardoc moilants carry out instructions with determination and a keen awareness that betrays a higher intelligence. The Ardoc family of Kaer Maga has achieved great success by mass-producing these constructs, which sell quickly due to their adaptability, durability, and ability to work for long periods with little need for oversight.

 Ardoc moilants are roughly humanoid in shape, with strong arms that end in massive gripping pincers. Moilants have large, shovel-shaped heads that they can lower to push aside dirt and stone. Of course, these tools that make the moilants so suited for heavy labor can also be used to make devastating attacks against those who interfere with their tasks.

 An Ardoc moilant is 25 feet tall and weighs 10 tons.
