  - name: Barbed Tentacles (Ex)
    desc: An abhominal attacks with all of its barbed tentacles at once, grappling and raking its target. This attack is a primary attack that deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage.
  - name: Grip (Ex)
    desc: The hands and feet of an abhominal adhere to surfaces so well that its 40-foot climb speed applies even to perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no chance of the abhominal falling off unless it is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a grapple.
  - name: Hive Hunt (Su)
    desc: When an abhominal pinpoints the location of a creature, that knowledge is instantly shared with other abhominals within 100 feet.
  - name: Tear (Ex)
    desc: When an abhominal attacks a creature that is already grappled by another abhominal, it can attempt to tear the creature between them with a successful pull combat maneuver check. The creature is not moved by the pull, but it takes an additional 3d6+6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage instead.
  - name: Telepathy (Su)
    desc: An abhominal can communicate telepathically with other abhominals and alghollthus that are within 100 feet.

## Description
Abhominals are a result of a failed experiment in which an aboleth employed ancient Azlanti technology to alter sentient humanoids. Though the test subjects died during their transformation, the strange energies involved animated them as undead horrors bound to serve their aboleth creator. These abominations share a hive mind, chattering telepathically with each other to determine a common purpose. All of them can be called into action instantly if their aboleth master issues a telepathic command, the dominating words reverberating from one connected mind to another. Abhominals hunger for the life energy of living beings, but their masters can keep their hunger in check in order to make them hunt new subjects to use in further experiments (who might end up sharing the fate of their captors).

 The midsection of an abhominal rises to a height of about 2-1/2 feet, though its barbed tentacles go much higher than that. They weigh over 250 pounds.
