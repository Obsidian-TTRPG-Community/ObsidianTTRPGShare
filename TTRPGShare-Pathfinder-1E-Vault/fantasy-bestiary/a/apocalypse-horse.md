special_abilities:
  - name: Apocalyptic Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: Each apocalypse horse has a breath weapon it can use once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. The breath weapon always fills a 90-foot cone, and can be resisted with a successful DC 38 Reflex save, but the exact effects of the breath weapon depend on the horse (see page 13). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Crushing Hooves (Ex)
    desc: An apocalypse horse’s hoof attacks are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage, and add 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    desc: An apocalypse horse inflicts 1 negative level whenever it hits with a bite or a hoof attack. When it tramples a creature, it inflicts 1 negative level unless the creature trampled fails a DC 32 Fortitude save, in which case the creature takes 1d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Favor of the Four (Su)
    desc: Each apocalypse horse has several unique, thematic spell-like abilities and a unique breath weapon based on which of the four Horsemen it serves. See page 13 for more details on each specific horse’s favor of the four special ability.
  - name: Unyielding to Oblivion (Su)
    desc: Intrinsically linked to their riders, apocalypse horses cannot die in the presence of their Horsemen. When being ridden or within 300 feet of its associated Horseman, rather than falling unconscious when below 0 hit points, an apocalypse horse instead gains the staggered condition, with additional damage simply increasing its number of negative hit points but carrying no other penalties. An apocalypse horse that is slain by a spell that causes instantaneous death rises as per true resurrection 1 round later, reconstituted in a manner consistent with its rider’s theme. Whenever an apocalypse horse fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting, petrification, polymorph, or immobilizing effect (including binding, imprisonment, and temporal stasis), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect as long as its associated Horseman remains within 300 feet of where the effect originally targeted the apocalypse horse. Attempting this new saving throw requires no action. An apocalypse horse can attempt a new save to end the effect once per round. An apocalypse horse more than 300 feet from its associated Horseman loses all benefits of the Unyielding to Oblivion ability

## Description
The apocalypse horse is less a particularly puissant nightmare or powerful equine daemon than a living extension of one of the Four Horsemen. There only four at any time: the white horse of Pestilence, the pale horse of Death, the red horse of War, and the black horse of Famine. While for the most part the Horsemen use their mounts themselves, they have been known to lend these mounts to favored daemonic or mortal servitors. The four apocalypse horses have also been known to travel the Material Plane or other planes on their own or in a group, often as a precursor to more direct attention to a world from the Horsemen. While each of the four apocalypse horses have similar statistics overall, they have unique abilities and personalities suited to their specific theme. 

An apocalypse horse is similar in size to a large horse, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 1,500 pounds despite its nearly skeletal frame.
