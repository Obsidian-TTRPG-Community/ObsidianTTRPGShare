  - name: Preserve (Ex)
    desc: An ambergrim can preserve a creature paralyzed by its swallow whole ability by spending 1 hour motionless to harden the soft resin shell into a gemlike case. A creature can attempt a DC 21 Fortitude saving throw at the end of the hour-long process to avoid being preserved; if successful, it remains entangled, but the ambergrim must start the process anew to preserve the creature. Dead and nonliving materials are preserved as if under the effects of an unguent of timelessness. Living creatures are held in stasis, unable to move and no longer needing to eat, drink, or breathe. A living creature can survive in this state for 1 day for each point of Constitution it has, after which it suffocates but remains preserved indefinitely as if by a gentle repose spell. Each day, a preserved creature can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim’s Constitution modifier) to break free of the amber shell. The shell has hardness 8 and 20 hit points; submerging it in strong alcohol for 1 hour can also dissolve the shell.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    desc: An ambergrim can use its swallow whole ability to swallow a creature of its own size category (usually Medium) or smaller. A swallowed creature is entangled, but instead of the Dexterity penalty normally imposed by the entangled condition, it takes a cumulative -1d6 penalty to its Dexterity score each round as the ambergrim coats it in thick resin. If this penalty exceeds the creature’s Dexterity score, it is paralyzed until the resin is removed.

 An ambergrim normally spits out paralyzed prey so it can target a new creature. A paralyzed creature outside the ambergrim that is not affected by its preserve ability can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim’s Constitution modifier) each round to free itself, but the entangled condition remains as long as any Dexterity penalty persists. The Dexterity penalty decreases by 1 every hour as the resin becomes brittle, or vanishes completely in 1d4 rounds if the resin is doused in strong alcohol.

## Description
Creeping masses of honey-colored slime, ambergrims are scavengers and collectors of the forest, rolling up unwanted bits of undergrowth and unsuspecting animals to preserve for later in timeless stockpiles hidden throughout their domains. Little more than aggressive, human-sized globs of sap and resin, they hunt by the twin graces of surprise and their incredibly sticky bodies, which naturally adhere to other creatures and draw them deeper into the ambergrims’ bulk. The oozes’ name describes both their rich, warm coloration as well as their ability to immobilize their prey within soft, amber-like capsules, which they can harden into tough cocoons to preserve food for later. Anything from rabbits to unwary human travelers is fit fodder for these oozes’ endless hunger.

 Ambergrims vary immensely in size and coloration depending on their environment and parentage, but the most common are roughly 4 feet across and weigh around 200 pounds.
