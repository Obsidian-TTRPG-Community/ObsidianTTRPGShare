special_abilities:
  - name: Beckoning Dance (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a veela can compel a target that it can see to join it in dancing. The target must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or find herself forced to dance with the veela for up to 1 minute. At the end of each of the target’s turns, she must attempt a Perform (dance) check opposed by the veela’s Perform (dance) check. If the target doesn’t meet or exceed the veela’s result, she takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued. For every point of Constitution damage a veela deals in this way, it heals 5 hit points. Hit points healed in excess of its maximum become temporary hit points that last up to 1 hour before dissipating. While engaged in a beckoning dance, both a veela and its target are protected from being attacked as if by a sanctuary spell (DC 18). Any target of a veela’s beckoning dance that exceeds the veela’s result on the opposed Perform check ends the beckoning dance and gains the benefits of the veela’s cure serious wounds spell-like ability (if any uses of that ability remain), which consumes one of the veela’s daily uses. Targets that save against a veela’s beckoning dance can’t be affected by that veela’s beckoning dance again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Elemental Veil (Su)
    desc: A veela’s link to a particular element manifests as an overflow of energy that infuses its natural attacks and any melee weapons it holds, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful melee attack. This is electricity damage for an air veela, bludgeoning damage for an earth veela, fire damage for a fire veela, and cold damage for a water veela. In addition, as a standard action a veela can wreathe itself in a luminescent halo of energy. This duplicates the effect of the spell fire shield (caster level 9th) but deals damage of the same damage type as the extra melee damage. Ending or resuming this effect is a standard action.
