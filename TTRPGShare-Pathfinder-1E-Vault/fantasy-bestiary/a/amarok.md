special_abilities:
  - name: Soul Bite (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, an amarok can bite directly into the soul of any creature it can see. A shadowy image of the bitten creature appears next to the amarok, and the amarok makes its bite attack as if the creature were within reach. A soul bite deals the same amount of damage as a normal bite attack, and ignores hardness and damage reduction. If its bite attack hits, the amarok can attempt to trip and grab the target. When the amarok grabs a creature in this way, the creature doesn’t move, but the amarok visibly wrestles with the shadowy image and the creature appears to be grappling with thin air. This ability doesn’t work against creatures that don’t have souls (like most constructs) or that don’t have a separate body and soul (like outsiders).

## Description
These powerful, wolflike creatures live in northern forests and on the vast, open tundra. Amarok are typically 12 feet long with midnight-black fur. Their eyes and sharp teeth glow with the color of moonlight, and their tails are longer and much more flexible than those of wolves. Unlike wolves, amaroks hunt alone, coming together only to breed and raise cubs. Amaroks are great hunters, and legends say nothing remains concealed from their gazes. When fighting, they rush forth and use their jaws to rip out the throats of their prey or attack their enemies’ souls.

Amaroks don’t hunt people for food, but they relish the thrill and strategy of the chase, and enjoy teaching lessons to those who foolishly hunt alone at night. The amaroks stalk hunters, then attack suddenly from the shadows. They bring their prey to the edge of unconsciousness, then depart back into the woods. Those who seek to improve their hunting techniques after these harrowing encounters earn the amaroks’ approval, and amaroks are excellent, if harsh, instructors of stalking, tracking, and wrestling techniques. They are also implacable foes of those who commit the one act they cannot forgive-a foolish person who slays an amarok’s pups faces a swift and brutal death at the amarok’s jaws.

An amarok is 29 feet from nose to the tip of its tail, stands 9 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 9 tons.
