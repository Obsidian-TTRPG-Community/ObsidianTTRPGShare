special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Truth (Sp)
    desc: An apocrisiarius kyton exudes an aura of truth, making it difficult for anyone within 30 feet to utter a lie. This effect functions as per zone of truth, save that it emanates from the kyton (not a fixed point in space) and thus moves along with the kyton. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lancet Mastery (Su)
    desc: An apocrisiarius kyton wields two lancets in combat. In the kyton’s hands, these weapons function as +1 keen punching daggers. The apocrisiarius kyton adds its Intelligence modifier as a bonus on all damage rolls for the lancets (this modifier is in addition to any other damage modifiers, such as that granted by Strength, and is included in the statistics above). When not wielded by the kyton, these weapons revert to nonmagical daggers. A kyton who loses a lancet can withdraw a lancet from its flesh and transform the blade into a new punching dagger as a move action.
  - name: Truthspeaker (Ex)
    desc: An apocrisiarius kyton is incapable of lying; it can withhold the truth by refusing to answer a question, but can’t utter or telepathically communicate a falsehood. Any attempts to do so (including attempts to obey commands to do so while the kyton is mind controlled) simply fail, as if the kyton had chosen not to communicate.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Su)
    desc: The gaze of an apocrisiarius kyton causes an opponent to become overwhelmed with a painfully acute awareness of all the times that lies (be they his own or those of others) have hurt or complicated his life. Those who fail to save against this effect are staggered for 1 round.

desc_short: This slender humanoid is clad in a severe black leather harness and long skirt decorated with curling twists of wire. Her eyes are colorless orbs, and tears of blood course down her cheeks. Slender surgical lancets pierce her body in numerous locations, yet these wounds do not bleed.

## Description
The term “sadistic” is synonymous with kytons, who are known for their innate cruelty and capacity to gain pleasure from the suffering of others. However, an apocrisiarius kyton considers inflicting pain and suffering nothing more than a tool to reach what truly intrigues it-the purest form of a single truth. An apocrisiarius typically appears as a human whose eyes are blank, white orbs. Tears of blood weep from its eyes-physical evidence of the sorrow it has tasted over the ages from dreadful truths torn from the flesh and mind of its countless victims. The dozens of surgical lancets that pierce an apocrisiarius’s body do the creature no harm, and the holes these instruments leave are as bloodless as they are deep. The kyton operates on those it captures with these lancets; these fiends prefer to use torture and vivisection to carve away both physically and metaphorically at their victims until all that remains is the one nugget of information they desire-a pure truth, unadulterated by extraneous life.
