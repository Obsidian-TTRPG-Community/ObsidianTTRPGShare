special_abilities:
  - name: Mimic Form (Su)
    desc: An azuretzi can mimic forms by spending a full-round action to study a creature. It can use change shape to assume a studied target’s form as a swift action, or revert to true form as a free action. It can maintain a number of studied targets equal to its Intelligence modifier, after which it must discard one to study a new creature.
  - name: Mocking Touch (Su)
    desc: An azuretzi can borrow a creature’s talents with a touch attack, suppressing the target’s ability to use a single spell or spell-like ability (up to 4th level) of the protean’s choice for 1d4 rounds. If the azuretzi suppresses the use of a spell, the target can’t cast that spell. The azuretzi can cast it once, using its own caster level and Charisma modifier to determine the spell’s effects and save DC. If the azuretzi suppresses a spelllike ability, it can use that ability up to three times, or as many times per day as its target could, whichever is fewer. Unwilling targets can resist the azuretzi’s mocking touch with a successful DC 16 Will save. An azuretzi can’t use mocking touch if it currently has access to a spell or ability from prior uses of this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spell Pilfer (Su)
    desc: Two azuretzis can work together as a standard action to redirect an ongoing spell effect from one creature within 30 feet to another. They can move a spell’s effect to themselves, sharing its effects as if they were one creature, or shift it to a single valid target of the original spell within 30 feet. The spell’s effects, caster level, and duration are unaffected, and continue as if the new target were the caster’s original target. With a successful DC 16 Will save, a creature can resist having a spell effect taken from it or applied to it. The save DC is Charisma-based.
