special_abilities:
  - name: Booster Jets (Ex)
    desc: As a swift action up to 10 times per hour, an annihilator can gain a fly speed of 60 feet (poor maneuverability) for a duration of 1 minute.
  - name: Chain Guns (Ex)
    desc: These advanced firearms have a range increment of 200 feet, automatically reload, and never misfire. An annihilator’s core can process scrap metal into new ammunition, effectively giving the annihilator infinite ammunition with these weapons.
  - name: Plasma Lance (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action once every 3 rounds, an annihilator can fire a 120-foot-long line of plasma from its tail. All creatures in this area take 20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half). Half of this damage is fire and half is electricity. The save DC is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Suppressing Fire (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, an annihilator can use its chain guns to fire in a 100-foot cone. When it does so, it makes a single chain gun attack against every target in this area.

## Description
The enormous and formidable annihilator robots roam old ruins and wastelands, ridding them of all life and civilization. They smash structures, slaughter creatures both sentient and bestial, and scorch plant life to ashes. When rampaging, an annihilator indiscriminately destroys rather than following the meticulous approach many other robots take with their work. Despite the destruction they wreak, annihilators often gather up those who survive their assaults, collecting the dying and unconscious from battlefields and bringing them to a set location. Their purpose for keeping these battered but still-living prisoners is unknown.
