  - name: Touch of Madness (Su)
    desc: The touch of an aoandon causes maddening fear. As a standard action it can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals 10d6 damage. Any living creature damaged by an aoandon’s touch attack must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw can’t be confused again by this aoandon’s touch of madness for 10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
An aoandon is an incorporeal outsider formed from the spirit of a woman who died pursuing some ill-fated relationship. An aoandon waits for her chance to seek revenge on those who wronged her in her mortal life. If that person is dead, she finds a surrogate-someone who reminds her of the wrongdoer-and acts out her delusions with unrelenting vindictiveness. These spirits can also appear as a result of mishaps with calling spells, but such instances are rare.
