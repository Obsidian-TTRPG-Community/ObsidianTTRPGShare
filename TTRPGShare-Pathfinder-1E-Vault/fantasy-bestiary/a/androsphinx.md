special_abilities:
  - name: Roar (Su)
    desc: An androsphinx can roar up to three times per day as a standard action. Each progressive roar has a different effect, depending upon whether it is the first, second, or third of the androsphinx’s roars for that day. All of these roars are sonic effects that fill a 60-foot-radius burst, centered on the androsphinx; the save DCs are Charisma-based. Sphinxes are immune to all of the effects of an androsphinx’s roars.

First Roar: Affected creatures become frightened for 2d6 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.

Second Roar: Affected creatures are paralyzed with fear and deafened for 1d4 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.

Third Roar: Affected creatures take a 2d4 penalty to Strength for 2d4 rounds and take 2d8 points of sonic damage. Creatures smaller than the androsphinx are knocked prone. A DC 19 Fortitude save negates the Strength penalty and being knocked prone.

## Description
The mightiest of the common sphinxes, androsphinxes see themselves as all that is worthy and noble in the species and carry themselves as though the weight of the world rests upon their good example. They view criosphinxes with paternalistic condescension, hieracosphinxes with poorly veiled disgust, and gynosphinxes as the only other sphinxes worthy of their time.

Androsphinxes put on a gruff and cantankerous front to outsiders. They make no effort to hide annoyance when displeased. Androsphinxes tend to be territorial, though less so than other sphinxes. They almost invariably warn and bluster before attacking, and nearly always heed a call to parley. Androsphinxes barter information and conversation for safe passage, not treasure.

Androsphinxes are 12 feet tall and weigh 1,000 pounds.
