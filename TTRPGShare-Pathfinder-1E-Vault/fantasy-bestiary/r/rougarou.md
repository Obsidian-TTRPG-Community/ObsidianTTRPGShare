## Description
Rougarous are wolf-headed humanoids who can transform into wolves. While this sometimes confuses others into mistaking a rougarou for a werewolf, these humanoids are not lycanthropes. In fact, most detest werewolves and hunt them mercilessly. 

The race isn’t numerous or widespread, and rougarous tend to live in secluded communities. They are very protective of their families and friends, and the communities they form tend to be strict and lawful. In their homeland, rougarous are most plentiful in southern swamps and marshes, where it is believed they originated, but have since spread throughout the rest of the world. While most of rougarou society is upstanding and trustworthy, as with any group there are some violent and aggressive members. These evil, loner rougarous occasionally form into packs that raid the countryside and prey upon the just and kind. Thankfully, rougarous are generally civilized and loyal, and most are quick to hunt down and punish their feral kin for their foul deeds. 

Rougarous age like humans, but they tend to be slightly taller and heavier than typical humans.
