special_abilities:
  - name: Jet (Ex)
    desc: While underwater, a ravenous urchin swarm can jet as a full-round action at a speed of 70 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: The venom of ravenous urchin swarms stiffens muscles and locks joints into painful configurations. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex and reduce movement speed by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet); cure 1 save.
  - name: Underfoot (Ex)
    desc: Each time a creature moves through a space occupied by a ravenous urchin swarm or starts its movement in such a space, it runs the risk of a ravenous urchin moving underfoot. The creature must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or take 1 point of damage plus poison. Additionally, the affected creature’s movement speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a ravenous urchin. Any creature moving at half its speed or slower can pick its way through a tidal pool of ravenous urchins (but not a ravenous urchin swarm) with no trouble. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Unlike most urchins, the creatures that make up the infamous urchin swarms are capable of propelling themselves beneath the waves at furious speeds, creating a dangerous threat to pearl divers and other aquatic creatures-often one that’s dismissed as a myth until it’s far too late.

Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via ocean currents or, more commonly, tides.
  - name: Hunter Urchins
    desc: : These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like tongues that can whip out and pull food to them.
  - name: Spear Urchins
    desc: : These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over to feed.
  - name: Glass Urchins
    desc: : So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to the potent hallucinatory effects of this urchin’s venom.

    desc: 89
desc_short: A wave of swift-moving spines rushes forward-a roiling tide of dangerously fast sea urchins.
