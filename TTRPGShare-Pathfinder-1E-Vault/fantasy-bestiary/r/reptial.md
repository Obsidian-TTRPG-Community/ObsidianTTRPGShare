special_abilities:
  - name: Imposing Presence (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a reptial can expand the frills on its robes and body dramatically, making it appear larger until the beginning of its next turn. All creatures within 30 feet who witness this transformation must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds. A creature who succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this reptial’s imposing presence for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Relic Collector (Ex)
    desc: Reptials are fond of collecting items with even tangential connections to significant celestial events. A reptial has a mental focus pool which it can choose to store in a relic. The pool contains a number of points equal to 5 + the reptial’s Intelligence modifier (9 points for a typical reptial). Each day, it can choose one school of magic that is tied to one of its relics. It gains the resonant power for that school of magic as if it were a 5th-level occultist storing all its points of mental focus in that relic. A reptial can only store focus in one relic at a time. As a free action, a reptial can expend 1 point of mental focus from the relic to add 1d6 to the result of a skill or ability check. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. A reptial can only use 1 point of mental focus per check. A reptial can use this ability to add a bonus on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill check without expending a point of mental focus.

## Description
Reptials are curious and benevolent scholars of Nirvana. They spend their time collecting holy relics, no matter how minor, and can store some of their knowledge within a chosen relic. They keep most of these relics for themselves, but individual reptials have been known to distribute particularly useful pieces to good-aligned individuals and temples that are enduring difficult trials. Such relics often appear mysteriously within a temple or home, placed carefully among other objects. Reptials prefer to avoid combat if possible, using their abilities to escape instead and find heroes or more warlike agathions to combat evil directly. A reptial stands 3 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds, not counting the weight of its many relics.
