special_abilities:
  - name: Distracted by Beauty (Ex)
    desc: With a successful Perform check, a character can attempt to fascinate a red reaver within 60 feet who is able to observe the performance (via sight or hearing, whichever is appropriate). The red reaver can resist the fascination effect with a successful Will save (DC = 1/2 the result of the Perform check), but once it becomes fascinated, it remains so until the performance stops, it takes damage, or it observes anyone damaging or stealing any of its treasures.
  - name: Flight (Su)
    desc: A red reaver’s ability to fly is supernatural.
  - name: Roar (Su)
    desc: A red reaver can unleash a terrifying roar once every 1d4 rounds. All creatures except other red reavers within 120 feet must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be shaken. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves become panicked. A creature who successfully saves can’t be further affected by the same red reaver’s roar for 24 hours. The shaken or panicked effect lasts for 4 rounds, but a character can end the effect early by succeeding at a DC 19 Will save at the end of any turn during which it was affected by the roar. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Territorial (Ex)
    desc: Whenever a red reaver finds a region it regards as particularly beautiful or compelling, it can create a unique bond with that territory. This effect is automatic after the red reaver spends 1d4 days within the area, which cannot be larger than 1 square mile. Once a red reaver bonds to a territory, it gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception checks and Survival checks in that area. In addition, while in its territory, a red reaver doesn’t fall unconscious when reduced to negative hit points and automatically stabilizes whenever it is at negative hit points.

## Description
Slow-witted but having a dangerous temper, red reavers are violent forces of nature. While red reavers don’t seek out fights and they are rarely aggressive when not provoked, their territorial nature and tendency to misinterpret others’ actions make approaching one an exceedingly dangerous proposition.
