## Description
Sometimes a samsaran perishes under especially dramatic emotional circumstances, causing its soul to wander the Ethereal Plane before finally reincarnating. This spirit journey frays the samsaran’s connection to his past lives but strengthens his ability to read others’ pasts and present.
