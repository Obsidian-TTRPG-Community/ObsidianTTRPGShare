  - name: Wind-Borne (Ex)
    desc: While in an area of moderate wind (11-20 mph), a ravenous tumbleweed’s speed increases by 10 feet when it moves in the direction of the wind. In an area of at least strong wind (21+ mph), its speed instead increases by 20 feet when it moves in the direction of the wind, and it gains a +2 dodge bonus to its AC against attacks of opportunity on any round in which it moves in that direction.

## Description
Unlike its harmless counterpart, a ravenous tumbleweed uproots itself when nutrients are scarce in order to hunt down live prey. These seasonally carnivorous plants gather into imposing drifts that wait for periods of high winds before overwhelming birds, rabbits, and even deer.
