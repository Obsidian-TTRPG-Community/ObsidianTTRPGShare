special_abilities:
  - name: Fatal Accident (Su)
    desc: Once per day as a standard action, a relictner can focus its deteriorating curse to wreak havoc around them. When using this ability, a relictner chooses a structure or manufactured object within 60 feet no larger than 15 feet by 15 feet, such as a statue, treasure chest, or support pillar. The chosen object falls, crumbles, or is otherwise compromised in such a way that it damages any creature adjacent to it, dealing 12d6 points of damage to each creature, or half as much damage to each creature that succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. Alternatively, the relictner can deal only 6d6 points of damage and also attempt a ranged bull rush, trip, or sunder maneuver check as a free action with a +4 racial bonus against each target that fails its Reflex save (sundering in this way deals 6d6 points of damage). This attack may deal more or less damage depending on the object chosen and the GM’s discretion, and it typically creates difficult terrain in the area around it. The DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ruin Bond (Su
    desc: ) A relictner forms a bond with the structure it calls home. Single relictners form bonds with huts or houses, families of relictners bond with castles or temples, and clans can bond with entire ruined cities. All structures in a relictner’s bonded ruin lose 1 hit point per day and can be reduced to a minimum of 10 hit points. Within its bonded ruin, a relictner gains a +10 bonus to AC and on saving throws against environmental effects and any traps. A relictner can have only one bonded ruin at a time but can create a new one by living in a suitable structure for at least 1 week. A relictner who spends more than 24 hours away from its bonded ruin becomes fatigued and shaken until it returns to the ruin.
  - name: Ruin Sense (Su)
    desc: A relictner is instantly aware of any creature that dies within its bonded ruin, as well as the direction and approximate distance of the dead creature.
  - name: Weathering Aura (Su)
    desc: A relictner radiates an entropic aura of decay and disrepair. All objects within 30 feet of a relictner, including held and worn nonmagical objects, have their hardness reduced by 5, to a minimum of 0, as long as they are within the area of the weathering aura and for 1 round after leaving the area. This is a curse effect.

## Description
A relictner mortic is two entities in one: a vicious, grasping curse and its half-undead dwarven host. The hosts resemble gaunt, prematurely aged dwarves, their hair gray and ragged, their faces nothing but masses of wrinkles. The curse, however, is a strong and subtle thing, rotting and weathering everything the relictner sees or touches until only ruins are left. Outcast and eternally bitter, most relictners remove themselves to abandoned halls and forgotten ruins that they remake into shrines of mortal despair, filling their new homes with traps and pitfalls to snare the unwary.

 A typical relictner stands about 4 feet tall and weighs 125 pounds.
