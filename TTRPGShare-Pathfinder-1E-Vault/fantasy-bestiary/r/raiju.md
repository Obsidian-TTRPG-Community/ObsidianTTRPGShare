special_abilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    desc: On the Material Plane, a raiju typically assumes the form of a badger, cat, giant rat, monkey, weasel, or wolf (as per beast shape II) to blend in with native wildlife. Even in these forms, however, it typically has pale coloration and lightninglike patterns.
  - name: Electric Body (Su)
    desc: As an immediate action, a raiju can transform itself into a ball of living lightning. While in this form, the raiju gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal quality. It only takes half damage from corporeal sources if they are magical (it takes no damage from nonmagical weapons and objects). Additionally, it sparks with electricity while it is in this form. Any creature that touches the raiju with a natural or unarmed attack or whose square the raiju passes through during its movement must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based. In normal weather, a raiju can remain incorporeal for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice, though it can remain incorporeal for as long as it pleases during a thunderstorm.
  - name: Shocking Burst (Su)
    desc: Besides dealing normal slashing damage, the claw and tail of a raiju are considered to have the shocking burst weapon special quality. They deal 1d6 extra points of electrical damage on a normal hit and an additional 1d10 points on a critical hit.

desc_short: The air around this strange, pale animal sparks with erratic flashes of static electricity, its body constantly twitching as if filled to capacity with the energy. It suddenly perks up, alert and seemingly ready to bolt.

## Description
Raijus are beings of living electricity that cross the border between the mundane world and their native plane, a region of the Plane of Air alive with endless thunderstorms. Raijus can be involuntarily hurled across the dimensions by a powerful lightning bolt originating in the Plane of Air, or might be called by magic users to do their bidding. When the weather is calm, raijus are quiet, and assume the forms of Tiny or Small animals such as cats, raccoon dogs, monkeys, or weasels. As weather gets worse, however, so do their tempers. In their real form, raijus appear as lean, foxlike creatures with long, sharp claws and luminous eyes, shrouded by crackling electricity. These swift, even panicky, creatures are charged with the electricity of their native realm, and those who touch them risk receiving a deadly shock. In times of great distress, they transform entirely into living electricity, a force that few barriers can contain and even fewer creatures can survive the passage of.

In their natural forms, raijus measure about 3-1/2 feet long and weigh 40 pounds, but they often take the form of small mammals when not on the Plane of Air. They can be still recognized as raijus in this form, however, as they bear markings suggestive of jagged lightning.
