## Description
This abnormally aggressive flock of ravens forgoes scavenging in favor of more active hunting for food. Multiple swarms of ravens make uncanny use of strategy, with one swarm flushing out prey and driving it directly into the onslaught of an allied swarm. The statistics for a raven swarm can also be used to represent any large, aggressive flock of flying birds.
