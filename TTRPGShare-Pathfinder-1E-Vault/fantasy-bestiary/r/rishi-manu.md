special_abilities:
  - name: Cosmic Fire (Su)
    desc: As a standard action a rishi manu can project a ray of cosmic fire with a range of 100 feet. Firing this ray does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ray deals 10d6 points of fire damage and 10d6 points of positive energy damage. This positive energy does not harm creatures not normally damaged by positive energy nor does it heal them.
  - name: Planetary Bond (Ex)
    desc: Each rishi manu is bonded to a particular planet on the Material Plane. While on its bonded world, a rishi manu doesn’t count as extraplanar. When traveling to its bonded world from an extraplanar location using plane shift, a rishi manu always arrives at the exact location of its choice.
  - name: Rishi Scepter (Su)
    desc: Rishi manus possess a scepter forged from thought and will. In the hands of a rishi manu, it functions as a +4 speed club that deals damage as if it were two size categories larger and penetrates damage reduction as if it were both lawful-aligned and good-aligned. A rishi manu can touch a living creature of lawful good alignment with its scepter, granting it the benefits of moment of prescience (CL 14th). Once a creature has benefited from the touch of a rishi scepter, it can’t benefit from it again for 24 hours.
