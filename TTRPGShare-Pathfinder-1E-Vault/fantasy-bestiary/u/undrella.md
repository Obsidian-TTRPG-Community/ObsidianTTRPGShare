  - name: Captivating Song (Su)
    desc: A harpy’s song has the power to infect the minds of those that hear it, calling them to the harpy’s side. When a harpy sings, all creatures aside from other harpies within a 300-foot spread must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same harpy’s song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most direct means available. If the path leads it into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the victim receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy’s attacks. This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Undrella is something of an anomaly: a harpy who grew so used to living alongside the other monsters in the ruined town of Kelmarane that she remained when a group of heroes from the civilized races moved in and resettled the area. When the region was later plagued by a powerful efreeti named Jhavhul, she found herself thrust from her adopted home and community, and swore bloody vengeance with a fury that only a harpy can muster. Though those events are now in the past, she still wears the scars of the conf lict-both physically and emotionally-and is now nearly as alien to her own kind as she is to all others.

A crack shot with her longbow-enhanced with the powers of frost during her quest for vengeance against the efreeti-Undrella is a terror on the wing, both for her well-placed missiles and her dangerously enchanting song. When confronted in person, Undrella quickly displays the narcissism that defines her personality, and is tolerant of others only so long as they flatter her, while at the same time turning every phrase into a sexual innuendo. As far as she’s concerned, she’s irresistible to creatures of all species, and though she may not kill all of the creatures she mates with, any who dare refuse her are quick to learn that the only thing more dangerous than a harpy’s affection is her wrath.
