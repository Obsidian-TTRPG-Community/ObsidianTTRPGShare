  - name: Treasure
    desc: standard
special_abilities:
  - name: Boulder Barrage (Ex)
    desc: An ulkreth can hurl up to four rocks as a full-round action or two rocks as a standard action. If rocks are available (as when the ulkreth uses its ground pounder ability to create rubble) it can pick up a single rock as a swift action, two rocks as a move action, or four rocks as a full-round action. If an ulkreth has a rock in each hand, it cannot use its rock catching ability.
  - name: Ground Pounder (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, an ulkreth can strike the ground with its powerful fists, turning the area within a 10-foot radius into dense rubble (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 412). Any creatures in this area at the time must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or fall prone. An ulkreth’s movement is not slowed by the rubble it creates.
  - name: Punch Through (Ex)
    desc: An ulkreth can use a full-attack action to make its gore and slam attacks against the same opponent. The ulkreth then totals the damage from all hits before applying any damage reduction or hardness.
  - name: Wrecker (Su)
    desc: An ulkreth’s rend special attack deals double damage to objects.

## Description
Ulkreths are among the mightiest servants of the demon lord Xoveron, the Horned Prince of gargoyles and lord of ruination. They exist solely to destroy, carrying out his will of devastation to cities and civilization throughout the planes, tearing down monuments and buildings in the name of their unholy patron. Ulkreths are 25 feet tall and weigh 10 tons.
