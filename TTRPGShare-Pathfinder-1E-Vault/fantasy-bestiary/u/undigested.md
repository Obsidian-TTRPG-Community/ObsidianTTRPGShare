## Description
Undigested are the animate slurry of the indigestible parts of a humanoid creature. They come into being when a giant beast that swallowed its prey alive is slain by unspeakable necromantic arts. A primal shard of the beast’s sentience is ripped from it during the agonizing moments of its death, animating the gelatinous humanoid remains within its stomach into an ooze-like undead creature which hungers to inf lict its digestive fate upon others. If the beast was digesting multiple creatures, this phenomenon results in undigested swarms instead. Undigested-implacable ambush predators-slop, ooze, and undulate through the dark places of the world in search of sustenance.
