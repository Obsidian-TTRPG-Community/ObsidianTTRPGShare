special_abilities:
  - name: Compelling Whisper (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, an umdhlebi can entice any humanoid creature within 30 feet to approach and lie down at the base of its trunk. This acts as a suggestion spell, but the umdhlebi can only compel this one action. A creature that makes a DC 20 Will save is unaffected, and is immune to the same umdhlebi’s compelling whisper for 24 hours. An umdhlebi can also use this ability on creatures it is grappling, increasing the DC to 25. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Treacherous Ground (Ex)
    desc: The mass of gnashing roots and stems at the base of an umdhlebi’s trunk are constantly in motion. As a result, all squares within 5 feet of the umdhlebi’s space are treated as difficult terrain for the purposes of movement through the area.
  - name: Writhing Tendrils (Ex)
    desc: All umdhlebis have eight tendrils, but the creature can only make 2 slam attacks in a single round. However, an umdhlebi can continue to make 2 slam attacks even while its other tendrils are grappling or constricting. An umdhlebi can use this ability as long as it has two or more tendrils free to attack.

    desc: 88
desc_short: What appeared at first glance to be the decaying husk of an enormous tree erupts into motion, as thick tendrils reach outward hungrily from all sides. Amid the jumble of motion, a subconscious whisper promises sleep and sweet rest to any that lie down at the thing’s base.

## Description
Umdhlebis are massive, intelligent, and carnivorous plants that take root in jungles. Their outer shell is brown and resembles the thick bark of a dead tree, while concealing the softer layer of green cellulose beneath. When they f lower, umdhlebis grow broad, fragile-looking crimson leaves with sharp, grasping edges. Umdhlebis draw their prey close with mind-affecting suggestions, enticing would-be victims to rest at the plant’s base, and then strike with their vine-like tendrils, each as thick as a man’s forearm.

Umdhlebis grow to almost 20 feet in height, but can be shorter or taller depending on the surrounding vegetation. An umdhlebi’s trunk ranges from 3 to 5 feet in diameter, and the plant as a whole weighs over 10,000 pounds.

Umdhlebis can live for up to 50 years.
