  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    desc: A quintessence golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A plane shift spell allows the golem’s DR to be bypassed by an aligned weapon (evil, chaos, good, or law; determined randomly) for 2d4 rounds, with no save. • A resurrection or true resurrection spell negates a quintessence golem’s energy drain and soul siphon abilities for 2d4 rounds. When cast in this way, resurrection and true resurrection do not require expensive material components.
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    desc: A quintessence golem adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage rolls for its slam attacks.
  - name: Soul Infused (Ex)
    desc: A quintessence golem’s animating spark is provided by the flow of souls through it into the Outer Planes and by the potential for life inherent in all quintessence, rather than an imprisoned elemental spirit. As a result, a quintessence golem, while not technically alive, does modify its hit points with its Charisma modifier. These hit points are already calculated into its statistics.
  - name: Soul Siphon (Su)
    desc: If any creature within 100 feet of a quintessence golem is reduced to negative hit points, it is immediately slain as its spirit is sent on to the afterlife due to the golem’s proximity. Whenever a creature is slain in this way, the quintessence golem regains 100 hit points and gains the effects of haste for 1 round.

## Description
Quintessence is the raw material that makes up all matter and life found on the Outer Planes. With its infinite potential for shape and state, it should come as no surprise that raw quintessence makes an outstanding material (in terms of both quality and price) for the construction of golems. A quintessence golem is among the greatest creations a mortal spellcaster can craft-while not technically alive, the quintessence golem is made of material that aches to live, trapped in a metaphysical state between mortal and immortal life. The quintessence that makes up these golems actually acts as a siphon of sorts that encourages souls to shed their mortal frame and slip into the soulstream to seek their judgment in the afterlife. This fact makes these golems particularly dangerous and quite well suited for the guardianship of powerful temples or graveyards.
