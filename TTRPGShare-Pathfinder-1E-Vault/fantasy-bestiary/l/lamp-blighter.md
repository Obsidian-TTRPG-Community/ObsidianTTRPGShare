special_abilities:
  - name: Bite (Ex)
    desc: A lamp blighter’s sharp-toothed bite is a primary natural attack that deals 1d8 points of damage.
  - name: Blighted Arrows (Su)
    desc: When a lamp blighter fires an arrow from any bow, it can augment the arrow’s properties by sprinkling it with dust from its wings as a free action. It can choose any one of the following effects when dusting an arrow. The lamp blighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its Charisma score (15 for a typical lamp blighter). The save DCs are Charisma-based. 

Bleeding Wound: The target must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, or it takes 1d4 points of bleed damage. 

Blinding Terror: The target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become blind and panicked for 1d4+2 rounds. If the target succeeds at its Will save, it is instead shaken for 1 round. 

Sleep: The target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or fall asleep for 5 minutes.
  - name: Claws (Ex)
    desc: A lamp blighter’s pointed claws are primary natural attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage and threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
  - name: Eye Pluck (Ex)
    desc: Once per round, when a lamp blighter confirms a critical hit with a claw attack, or when it hits a helpless creature with a claw attack, it can pluck out its target’s eye as a free action unless the affected creature succeeds at a DC 13 Fortitude save. A creature that loses an eye this way takes a -4 penalty on all sight-based Perception checks until the damage is repaired (such as with a restoration spell). The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Invisibility (Su)
    desc: A lamp blighter remains invisible when it attacks. This ability is constant, but the lamp blighter can suppress or resume it as a free action.

## Description
Twisted in mind and form, lamp blighters have been corrupted by their own hatred for civilization and its encroachment upon lands that were once wild. Named for their practice of darkening lamps to draw victims close and also their love of ripping out eyes with their vicious claws, they take out this hatred upon inhabitants of border villages and towns, amplifying fear of the dark in the places they bedevil.

 Lamp blighters stand 2 feet tall fully when upright, though they are usually hunched over and flying at eye level of their victims, and they weigh about 20 pounds.
