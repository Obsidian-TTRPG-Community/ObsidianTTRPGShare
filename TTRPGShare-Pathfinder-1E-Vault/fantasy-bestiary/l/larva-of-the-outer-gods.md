special_abilities:
  - name: Liberated Flesh (Su)
    desc: A larva of the Outer Gods can use its song to free creatures from their static forms. As a standard action that does not interrupt its performance, a larva can attempt to liberate the flesh of each creature currently affected by its maddening song. Each target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into a chaos beast (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 54) under the larva’s control. A break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell can return the creature to its original form, though the chaos beast does not willingly submit to such efforts. This is a sonic polymorph effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Maddening Song (Su)
    desc: A larva of the Outer Gods can play a song on its pipes that inspires madness in those who hear it. Each creature within 30 feet of the larva is compelled to dance, as per irresistible dance, for as long as the larva continues to play. A creature can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist the effect, becoming immune to the larva’s song for 24 hours. Creatures that fail their saving throws can act normally if removed from the maddening song’s area of effect, but they must attempt a new saving throw upon re-entering the song’s radius. Beginning a maddening song is a standard action, but a larva can continue the performance on subsequent rounds as a free action. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Tentacles-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex drain and 1d4 Wis drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Starflight (Su)
    desc: A larva of the Outer Gods can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM’s discretion)-provided the larva knows the way to its destination.
  - name: Void Singer (Su)
    desc: The songs of a larva of the Outer Gods travel through the fabric of reality itself. Sonic spells and effects produced by the larva, including its maddening song and liberated flesh abilities, function even in the void of space, in areas of magical silence, and against deaf creatures.

## Description
At the heart of the Dark Tapestry lies Azathoth, a shapeless entity the size of a star, imbued with immense chaotic and destructive power. The members of Azathoth’s court orbit it like planets, exalting in the babbling nonsense the blind idiot god issues into the void and singing songs of exquisite madness to their lord. The least of this celestial choir are the larvae of the Outer Gods, shed from Azathoth as a body sheds skin cells. They conjure instruments from the ether, such as pipes and flutes, with which to serenade their progenitor as they mature into gods of the void.

Larvae of the Outer Gods are constantly shifting in form, but average 10 feet in diameter and weigh 1,600 pounds.
