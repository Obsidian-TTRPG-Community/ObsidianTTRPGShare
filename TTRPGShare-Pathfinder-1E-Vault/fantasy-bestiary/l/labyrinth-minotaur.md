special_abilities:
  - name: Bronze Mask (Su)
    desc: A labyrinth minotaur draws agility and ferocity from its bronze mask. When it makes a full-attack action, a labyrinth minotaur wearing its bronze mask can give up its regular attacks and instead make one gore attack or bull rush against each opponent within reach. It must make a separate attack roll against each opponent, and it can’t choose to move with targets that are pushed back. A labyrinth minotaur’s bronze mask has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. If a labyrinth minotaur’s bronze mask is stolen or destroyed, it can create a replacement with 1 week of work.
  - name: Natural Cunning (Ex)
    desc: Like a normal minotaur, a labyrinth minotaur possesses innate cunning and logical ability, granting it immunity to maze spells and preventing it from ever becoming lost. Further, a labyrinth minotaur is never caught flat-footed.
  - name: Steel-Shod Hooves (Ex)
    desc: A labyrinth minotaur’s steel-shod hooves are particularly devastating when used to trample an opponent. A creature that takes full damage from a labyrinth minotaur’s trample ability (because the creature either failed its Reflex save or chose to take an attack of opportunity instead of attempting a Reflex save) is knocked prone and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the labyrinth minotaur’s trample ability) reduces the duration of the staggered condition to 1 round.

desc_short: This hulking minotaur’s hooves are clad in imposing steel. The massive beast wears a heavy bronze mask that covers most of its face.

## Description
Labyrinth minotaurs are the elite guards and favored servitors of Baphomet. They are thicker and taller than mortal minotaurs, and possess skill in metalcraft that they use to forge armor, weapons, and their personalized and iconic bronze masks. Labyrinth minotaurs eagerly charge intruders, trampling smaller opponents and knocking back larger foes. As they are perceptive, tireless, and incapable of becoming lost, labyrinth minotaurs make excellent guardians of Baphomet’s bewildering maze of a domain, the Ivory Labyrinth. Labyrinth minotaurs stand about 11 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.
