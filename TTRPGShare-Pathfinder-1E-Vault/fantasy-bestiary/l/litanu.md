  - name: Seclusion Empowerment (Su)
    desc: Litanus draw strength from other creatures’ feelings of isolation and loneliness. A litanu gains a +1 profane bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls for each non-litanu creature within 60 feet that does not have line of sight to an ally, including any creature affected by the litanu’s sequestering paralysis. These profane bonuses stack, up to a maximum equal to the litanu’s Charisma modifier (maximum +5 for a normal litanu).
  - name: Sequestering Paralysis (Su)
    desc: Creatures affected by a litanu’s paralysis cannot breathe and begin to suffocate, and they are blinded and deafened. Although effects such as remove blindness/deafness can remove the blinded or deafened condition from a creature paralyzed by a litanu, this does not remove the paralysis. This ability is a necromancy and paralysis effect.

## Description
Litanus are undead abominations created by vile necromantic rituals and psychological torment. All litanus were once merfolk, but were tortured to death and animated as undead creatures. Litanus are sneaky, spiteful creatures who seek prey suffering from loneliness and fear.

 Resembling merfolk that have hyperdeveloped musculature, litanus have wide mouths with narrow, sharklike teeth. Four tentacles sprout from a litanu’s back, each a few inches wide and 4 feet long. These tentacles end in toothy maws and excrete a paralyzing toxin so powerful that victims are rendered insensible and unable to perform most autonomic functions, including breathing, until the toxin wears off.

 A litanu is about 7 feet long from head to tail and weighs around 300 pounds.
