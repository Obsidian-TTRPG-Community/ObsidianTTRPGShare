special_abilities:
  - name: Genius Loci (Su)
    desc: As a free action, a lar can possess any inanimate object with which it comes into contact, thereby animating it under its control. The object and lar merge, taking on the statistics of an animated object of the same size (see animated objects in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A lar may possess any object of Tiny to Large size. If the animated object is destroyed or targeted by dispel good, the lar is expelled and takes 1d6 points of damage per size category of the possessed object-1d6 for a Tiny object, 2d6 for a Small object, and so on. The lar is then free to possess another object, if one is available. If a lar is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it is banished to its statua for 24 hours, after which it is fully healed. If the lar does not have a statua, or the statua is destroyed while it is at 0 or fewer hit points, the lar is killed.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    desc: This ability is constant, allowing a lar to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the invisibility purge spell.
  - name: Statua (Su)
    desc: All lares rely on a small stone figure, known as a statua, for survival. This figurine serves as a lar’s home, resting place, and tie to the Material Plane. Lares typically rest within their statua, finding it a comfortable place from which to oversee their surroundings. For every round a lar spends doing nothing besides resting within its statua, it regenerates 1 point of damage. However, being separated from the statua for extended periods of time weakens the lar. For every 5 hours a lar remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Only returning to the statua can heal this damage. If a lar falls to 0 hit points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the Upper Planes. While a lar’s statua exists, the connected lar is treated as a native outsider. Any attempt to banish the lar-through dismissal or a similar spell-merely transports the creature back to its statua. If the statua is destroyed, a lar can be dismissed from the Material Plane as normal.
  - name: Suggestion (Sp)
    desc: A lar can influence creatures as per the spell suggestion, with some variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a lar must occupy the same square as its target. The lar is considered to be able to speak any language and communicate with any creature-even animals and vermin (which are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)-for the purposes of this effect. The target may attempt to resist a lar’s suggestion by making a DC 17 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

## Description
Sometimes referred to as “watchsouls,” lares are subtle, benevolent spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons.

Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable.
