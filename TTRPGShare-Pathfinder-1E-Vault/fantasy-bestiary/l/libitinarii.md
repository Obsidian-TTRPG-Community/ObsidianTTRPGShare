special_abilities:
  - name: Icicles (Ex)
    desc: A libitinarii can use the icicles embedded into its flesh as thrown ranged weapons, with a range increment of 20 feet. It can retrieve up to four of these icicles per round as a free action. These icicles deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus the libitinarii’s Strength modifier (usually +6) plus 2d6 points of cold damage; they deal triple damage on a critical hit (although the cold damage is not increased). The icicles aren’t considered magic weapons, but they are supernaturally hardened and count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once the libitinarii has retrieved icicles from its flesh, new icicles immediately form as a free action. If the libitinarii’s regeneration is suppressed, it also can’t form new icicles. A libitinarii typically has 24 icicles embedded in its flesh at any time.
  - name: Icy Fiend (Ex)
    desc: A libitinarii’s body is made from an unholy union of soulstuff and the icy essence of the coldest reaches of the Shadow Plane. As such, the libitinarii is immune to cold, and it can treat any difficult terrain that results from magical or mundane ice as normal terrain, such as the icy terrain of the Frozen Tears, realm of the kyton demagogue Inkariax.
  - name: Perfect Freeze (Su)
    desc: A libitinarii can harness the power of absolute zero and impose it upon the body of a living creature with a touch. The libitinarii can use this ability three times per day as a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. If the libitinarii’s touch attack is successful, the target takes 2d6 points of cold damage and 2d6 points of evil-aligned magic damage. A successful DC 23 Fortitude saving throw halves each type of damage. Additionally, creatures that fail this saving throw must immediately attempt a DC 23 Will saving throw. Failing this second saving throw means that a creature has been frozen solid and has become a supernaturally frozen, mindless, inert statue and is considered petrified, per flesh to stone (if the creature is not made of flesh, this secondary ability has no effect). The creature can’t be turned back to flesh by casting stone to flesh spell, but it can be restored via casting break enchantment. If the creature isn’t returned to flesh after a number of hours equal to the creature’s Hit Dice, the creature dies and remains a frozen statue. It can be returned to life normally by casting raise dead or similar spells. This is a cold effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Ex)
    desc: A creature that succumbs to a libitinarii’s unnerving gaze becomes staggered for 1 round as it feels itself slowly freezing from the inside out.

## Description
Libitinariis form from the souls of cold-obsessed spellcasters, wicked taxidermists, torturers partial to using frostbite to torment their victims, and other evil beings obsessed with inflicting pain through the perfect preservation of cold. They roam the Shadow Planes’ frozen reaches seeking to further their craft. Most serve Inkariax, the kyton demagogue known as the White Death, who seeks to preserve the fleetingness of perfection with his icy-fingered grasp. Indeed, the demagogue’s favored servants almost entirely consist of libitinariis.

 Other libitinariis serve Doloras, the demigoddess of dispassion, detachment, and pain, who many kytons believe was the infernal patroness that released their kind from Hell eons ago. In some cases, libitinariis pay homage to both unholy deities, for the two churches share more in common than not. Certainly Inkariax and his worshippers pay homage to the fell queen, and so many libitinariis consider deference to her a matter of course.

 Libitinariis’ bodies seem humanoid, though their skin ranges in color from powder to navy blue. Their lips, ears, fingers, and toes are deep black, as if horribly frostbitten. Libitinariis often wear robes of draping chains, though most prominent on their persons are the horrific icicles that pierce their flesh. Although they are as adept at wielding traditional weapons as any humanoid, they typically favor using these icicles as thrown weapons.

 Libitinariis are roughly 5 feet tall and typically weight from 90 to 140 pounds.
