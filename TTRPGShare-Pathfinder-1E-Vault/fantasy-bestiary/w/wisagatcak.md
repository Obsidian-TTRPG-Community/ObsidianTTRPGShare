special_abilities:
  - name: Insidious Whispers (Su)
    desc: The wisagatcak relentlessly assaults intelligent creatures within 60 feet with an onslaught of telepathic whispering consisting of dark temptations and horrifying promises that can drive victims mad. If a creature begins its turn within the area of a wisagatcak’s insidious whispers, it must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or take 1 point of Wisdom damage. Once a creature takes 4 points of Wisdom damage from insidious whispers (from one or multiple overlapping auras), it becomes afflicted with paranoia (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures 185). A character suffering from paranoia is immune to further Wisdom damage from insidious whispers. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ravage Flesh (Su)
    desc: If a wisagatcak hits a target with at least three of its attacks, it can attempt to rake the foe. Once a wisagatcak has raked a foe, it can automatically attempt to rake that foe in the following round and gains a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls with its rake attacks. If a wisagatcak successfully damages the same foe with its rake attack in 2 successive rounds, it gains the effects of haste in the following round.
  - name: Weakness (Su)
    desc: A creature bitten by a wisagatcak must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength drain. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Though wisagatcaks do not have a true hive mind, waves of these creatures are intimidatingly coordinated when hunting prey. Although they are outsiders and do not need to feed to survive, wisagatcaks enjoy the taste of warm flesh. A single wisagatcak can reduce a human body to its skeleton with unsettling speed.

 A wisagatcak has a leg span of 5 feet and weighs 60 pounds.
