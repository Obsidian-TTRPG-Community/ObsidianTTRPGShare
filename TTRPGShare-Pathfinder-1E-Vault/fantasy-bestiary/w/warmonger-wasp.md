    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds as part of a move action that’s taken to fly at least 10 feet, a warmonger wasp’s wings can discharge a bolt of electricity to a range of up to 60 feet. The bolt explodes upon reaching its target, creating a 20-foot-radius burst that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Like the more powerful retriever, the warmonger wasp is a construct built from the protoplasmic flesh and chaotic fecundity of the Abyss itself. Partially organic and partially metallic, warmonger wasps serve demonic armies as air support in large battles. Their electricity-based explosions work well on battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as electrical attacks have no effect on demons. Warmonger wasps are grown rather than constructed, and while the procedure of crafting these constructs is beyond the ken of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure them to do their bidding. Warmonger wasps are only intelligent enough to understand simple commands, and even then they generally understand only commands universally associated with battlefield conditions.

 A warmonger wasp is about 10 feet long, has a 20-foot wingspan, and weighs 1,200 pounds.
