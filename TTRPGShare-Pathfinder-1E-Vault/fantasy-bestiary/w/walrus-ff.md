## Description
Young walruses start out with gray hides, but their flesh becomes almost pinkish when they reach old age (20-30 years for most walruses). Their hide is up to 4 inches thick, with another 6 inches of blubber hidden underneath that, accounting for their incredible toughness-and for their usefulness to arctic cultures as a source of meat and fuel.
