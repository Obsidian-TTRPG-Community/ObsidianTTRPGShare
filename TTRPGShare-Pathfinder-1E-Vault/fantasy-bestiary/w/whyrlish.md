special_abilities:
  - name: Cnidocytes (Ex)
    desc: A whyrlish’s tentacles are laced with supernatural microscopic cnidocytes that lodge themselves into targets upon a successful tentacle attack. These barbs cause intense pain, but also dampen the victim’s resistance to electricity damage. When a creature is stung by a whyrlish, it must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw to avoid becoming staggered by pain for 1 round. After this round, the pain reduces to a dull ache, causing the creature stung to be sickened for 1 minute. As long as a creature is staggered or sickened by the cnidocytes, it loses its resistance and immunity to electricity damage, if any. A target that succeeds at its saving throw negates this effect entirely. This is a pain effect and the save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Electrical Discharge (Su)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds, a whyrlish can emit a powerful discharge of electricity from its bell as a standard action, creating a 120-foot-long line of electricity. Each creature caught in this area takes 15d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 26 half). In the round immediately following an electrical discharge, the whyrlish’s natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage on a hit (this damage does not increase its constrict damage). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Tentacles (Ex)
    desc: A whyrlish’s tentacles are a primary natural attack.

## Description
The whyrlish is a fascinating sight to behold; a jellyfish-like giant often found floating tranquilly alongside the River of Souls in the Astral Plane. These creatures gain nourishment from the metaphysical energies of the River of Souls-a process that does not harm the souls passing through the river but that often puts the whyrlish in direct confrontation with predators who seek to harvest souls for their own nefarious purposes. Whyrlishes fight ferociously against such predators, more out of a reflexive defense than from any real form of altruism or desire to protect the souls.

 A typical whyrlish is 30 feet long (including tentacles), and weighs about 2,500 pounds.
