  - name: Acidic (Su)
    desc: Any creature that touches a warpglass ooze or strikes it with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d4 points of acid damage unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save. A creature that strikes a warpglass ooze with a melee weapon must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save, or that weapon takes 1d4 points of acid damage. Ammunition that strikes a warpglass ooze is automatically destroyed after it inflicts its damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Buoyant (Ex)
    desc: A warpglass ooze can move on the surface of water-based liquids as if using water walk.
  - name: Compelling Reflection (Su)
    desc: A warpglass ooze displays supernaturally captivating images of nearby creatures. A creature within 30 feet of a warpglass ooze must succeed at a DC 13 Will save at the beginning of its turn or be compelled to move toward the ooze and take no other actions for 1 round, avoiding any other dangers along its path (including any movement that would provoke attacks of opportunity). A creature can avoid the need to make the saving throw by not looking at the warpglass ooze, as with a gaze attack. If an affected creature ends its turn adjacent to the ooze, it touches the ooze and takes a -1 penalty on all Wisdom- and Charisma-based checks from the harrowing images it sees. This penalty stacks, up to a total of -4. The penalty is a curse effect that slowly fades with time, reducing the penalty by 1 every 24 hours until it reaches 0. A creature that successfully saves against this effect can’t be affected again by the same warpglass ooze’s compelling reflection for 24 hours. Sightless creatures can’t be affected by this ability, nor can creatures that cast no reflection (such as vampires). This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
A menace featured in Varisian folk tales, warpglass oozes lurk in marshes and forests, masquerading as a simple puddle or stretching across the surface of a larger body of water. Tales say that a traveler can indeed see her future in the reflections of a warpglass ooze... if she can survive the creature’s enchanting magic and acidic caress. In fact, creatures that look upon these ambush predators do see a warped reflection of themselves-possibly dressed as a regal knight, weeping over an open grave, or holding aloft a valuable bauble-though there is no evidence the images are founded in reality.

 Warpglass oozes aren’t particularly intelligent, but they are patient, favoring subtlety over brute combat. The oozes enthrall their prey with fanciful images, compelling their victims to touch its acidic surface so the ooze can break down and digest the victim’s flesh. A warpglass ooze’s images might be whimsical or terrifying, but they always feature the viewing creature reflected in the ooze’s surface. Creatures that shake off the ooze’s compulsion find their minds lingering on the distorted reflections as they attempt to meet-or avoid-the fate they witnessed. If attacked, warpglass oozes extrude knots of protoplasm to bludgeon foes, but they often retreat in the face of powerful opposition. Warpglass oozes typically don’t pursue escaping prey as long as other food sources remain available, but if hungry enough, an ooze may follow a solitary creature.

 A typical warpglass ooze is about 4 feet in diameter and a few inches thick, and it weighs about 250 pounds.
