special_abilities:
  - name: Javelin Barrage (Ex)
    desc: As a move action, a Warmaze Disciples troop can hurl a barrage of javelins. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop’s space. All creatures in one of these lines take 4d6 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 19 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Natural Cunning (Ex)
    desc: A Warmaze Disciples troop can never be caught flat-footed.
  - name: Powerful Charge (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a Warmaze Disciples troop can move in a straight line up to its speed. If the troop moved at least 10 feet and did not cross any difficult terrain, its troop damage increases to 8d6+8 until the end of the round.
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    desc: Once per day as a free action, a Warmaze Disciples troop can whip itself into a frenzy, increasing all damage it deals by 1d6, gaining a +2 bonus on Fortitude and Will saving throws, and gaining 32 temporary hit points. While raging, the troop takes a -2 penalty to AC and can’t use any ability that requires patience or concentration, or any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills other than Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride. These effects last for 16 rounds or until the troop dismisses them.

## Description
Kosseruk’s philosophy of war as a labyrinth has earned her many followers among the Ironfang Legion’s minotaurs. The most dedicated of these are the Warmaze Disciples. While most Warmaze Disciples have training as barbarians, they eschew the mindless violence associated with that role and focus on honing their rage to a deadly point.
