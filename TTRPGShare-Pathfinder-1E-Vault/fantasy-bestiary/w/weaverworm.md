special_abilities:
  - name: Drag (Ex)
    desc: A weaverworm that successfully entangles a victim with its web attack can retract the web, dragging the victim into its clutches. Each round, the entangled victim can attempt a CMD check to escape. Upon a failed check, the weaverworm forcibly drags its victim 20 feet toward it.
  - name: Paralytic Nails (Ex)
    desc: A weaverworm’s nails secrete a potent paralytic agent. Any creature damaged by its claw attacks must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round. In addition, the weaverworm’s nails break off in the bodies of those it paralyzes. A paralyzed creature must make another save to avoid being paralyzed again at the beginning of its round, doing so every round until the nail is removed as a full-round action. A weaverworm’s nail can be removed with either a DC 12 Strength check, which removes the nail and deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim, or a DC 14 Heal check, which deals no damage. A weaverworm’s paralytic nails don’t affect any creature that is immune to poison. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Weaver’s Song (Su)
    desc: A weaverworm can play its webs like a grotesque musical instrument. When doing so, all nonweaverworms within 300 feet must make DC 18 Will saves. Those who make their saves are unaffected. Those who fail are fascinated, and on their turn, move toward the weaverworm by the most direct means available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim within 5 feet of the weaverworm simply stands and listens. This effect continues for as long as the weaverworm performs and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the victim is immune to the same weaverworm’s song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    desc: 86
desc_short: The bloated white segments of a maggot’s body erupt in a torso of mixed feminine and insectile features. Pale humanoid skin and carapace meld together beneath a face with segmented eyes and mandibles chittering a song of discordant alien clicks and hisses, as overlong carapace claws weave cords of thick webbing between them.

## Description
Foul servants of the goddess of disease and gluttony, weaverworms-or simply “weavers,” as they are often called-are terrifying abominations, combining the features of predatory insects, monstrously huge larvae, and deathly pale humanoids. Creations of Urgathoa forgotten by their cruel mistress long ago, these horrors seek out the dark places of the world, sowing murder and fear from the darkness, and all the while raising unnatural songs in praise of the goddess of gluttony.

Weaverworms typically measure 18 feet long, though the most bloated weigh upward of a ton.
