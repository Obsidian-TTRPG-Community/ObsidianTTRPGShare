## Description
The dimorphodon’s jaws contain two separate rows teeth: several large fangs near the front (used to grip prey and inject poison) and numerous smaller, sharp teeth along the rest of the jaw.

Dimorphodons are known for being easy to train. Handle Animal checks to train dimorphodons are attempted with a +4 bonus, and a dimorphodon can know one bonus trick chosen by its trainer once the creature has been fully domesticated.

A dimorphodon’s wingspan is between 4 and 5 feet long.
