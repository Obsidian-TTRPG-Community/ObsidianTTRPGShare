## Description
Most common in warm or temperate waters, the death’s head jellyfish is an aggressive predator. The creature derives its name from the pattern on its 4-foot-wide bell and from the poison it delivers with its tentacles. Those unfortunate enough to be subjected to this toxin develop rigor of the facial muscles that results in a wide-eyed grimace if left untreated.
