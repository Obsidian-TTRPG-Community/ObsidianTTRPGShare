    desc: A dweomer cap naturally emits dim light in a 10-foot radius. When in contact with a creature or object that has a faint or stronger magical aura, a dweomer cap’s light shimmers perceptibly, changing its hue and pattern. A dweomer cap can suppress or resume its luminescence as a standard action, though it has reason to do so only when serving as a familiar and ordered by its master to do so.

## Description
A dweomer cap is a black mushroom covered in wavy purple and orange patterns. It is typically found in regions of residual magical activity, such as abandoned arcane laboratories and sites of magical disasters. Although a dweomer cap can subsist on decaying organic material, it thrives and releases spores only when it can absorb trace magical energies. This makes these fungi an indicator that magical traps or treasures might be nearby. Spellcasters sometimes adopt dweomer caps as familiars, learning to read the fungi’s scintillations to help identify nearby magical effects.

 A typical dweomer cap is about 1 foot wide and weighs around 2 pounds.
