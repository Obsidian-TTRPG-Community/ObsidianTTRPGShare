  - name: Fling (Ex)
    desc: If a deadly mantis begins its turn with a Large or smaller creature grabbed in its claws, it can, as a standard action, fling that creature up to 30 feet away. Creatures thrown in this way take 3d6 points of damage as if they had fallen from the same distance.
  - name: Rending Mandibles (Ex)
    desc: If a deadly mantis hits with both claws and successfully grabs a foe, it can make an immediate bite attack against that foe as a secondary attack. This bite attack has a +12 attack bonus and deals 4d6+6 points of damage. In addition to dealing damage, the mantis can tear away the victim’s armor as a free action by making a combat maneuver check. If the mantis is successful, the target’s armor is ripped from its body. If the target fails a DC 31 Reflex save, the armor subjected to this attack loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. The save DC is Strength-based.

## Description
The legendary deadly mantis stalks the deepest jungles of Mediogalti Island and the Mwangi Expanse. Tales about this lethal predator preying upon such mammoth creatures as drakes and giants frighten even the bravest hunters. Deadly mantises are sacred to the followers of Achaekek, the Mantis God, who keep the massive beasts well fed, and bring them sacrificial victims and livestock. Followers of Achaekek have also been known to serve as protectors of the dens of deadly mantises. Though creatures of this size and power obviously need no guardians, the devout followers guard their lairs and prevent adventurers from slaying the mighty insects. The typical deadly mantis stands 40 feet tall, 60 feet long, and weighs several tons.
