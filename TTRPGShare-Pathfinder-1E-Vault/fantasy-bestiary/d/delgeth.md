  - name: Fight with Fire (Su)
    desc: A delgeth can strike at the ground with its flaming hooves as a swift action, causing blazing sparks to appear in any square within 30 feet. A creature in that square must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or catch fire. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Flight of Flames (Su)
    desc: A delgeth can use its smoldering hooves to ignite the ground and brush when it runs or withdraws, creating a blazing trail of fire behind it. The fire fills every square the delgeth moves through during its Run or withdraw action. When the fire appears and on each of the delgeth’s turns, the flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage to each creature in one of the fire-filled squares and 2d4 points of fire damage to each creature within 5 feet of such a square but not inside one. The flames burn out after 3 rounds, but can be extinguished before then by any means that would extinguish normal nonmagical fires of their size. The flames can ignite flammable debris in the squares the delgeth moved through, but in normal forest conditions they rarely spread far beyond there.

## Description
Delgeths are a unique breed of ungulate native to magical forests and places where the line between the natural and the supernatural is blurred. A delgeth’s soaring core body temperature manifests in the elk-like creature’s flaming hooves and smoldering antlers, both of which the beast uses to defend itself. A delgeth also employs its flames to mark its territory during mating season, stamping out boundaries of scorched grass in intricate patterns to indicate its location to others of its kind.

Delgeths are unpredictable creatures, and are equally as likely to Run from predators as they are to stand their ground and face off against aggressors. Either way, a delgeth is sure to leave a fiery reminder of its passing, as the beast’s flaming hooves blaze a telltale trail through the brush.

Tribal cultures and scholars of the supernatural alike hold the majestic delgeth in awe. Though delgeths have innate connections to flame, they live in balance with the natural world in the wooded territories where they roam. They refrain from allowing their flames to run uncontrolled in the environment, instead allowing natural fires to periodically purge the forest of excess deadwood.

A typical delgeth stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 200 pounds.
