  - name: Blood Feast (Su)
    desc: When a creature within 30 feet of a feeder in the depths takes bleed damage (including ongoing damage), the feeder heals an equal amount of damage.
  - name: Deadly Bleeding (Su)
    desc: A feeder in the depth’s bite causes bleeding wounds that resist healing. The first bite that damages a creature deals 1d4 points of bleed damage, and each subsequent bite increases the amount of bleed by 1d4. Stopping the bleeding requires a successful DC 20 Heal check or the application of any magical healing. However, anyone attempting to cast a healing spell on a creature suffering from deadly bleeding must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell doesn’t affect the bleeding creature. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Keen Scent (Ex)
    desc: A feeder in the depths can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater, and can detect blood in the water at a distance of up to 1 mile.
  - name: Swift Bite (Ex)
    desc: When making a full attack, a feeder in the depths can make a second bite attack at a -5 penalty.

## Description
Feeders in the depths closely resemble ordinary sharks, but they are faster, stronger, and far more intelligent and malevolent. Feeders in the depths begin life as ordinary sharks, raised under the care of sahuagin priestesses. A would-be feeder feasts on the flesh of merfolk, sea elves, and other aquatic humanoids. As it dines on these sacrifices, the priestess chants blasphemous rituals, infusing the shark with malign power and the stolen intelligence of its victims. Over the course of 13 feedings over 13 midwinters, a new feeder in the depths arises.

Feeders in the depths view themselves as equals to sahuagin, not as servants. They have no special affection for sharks, and can’t communicate with them. Feeders act as loyal companions as long as they’re respected and given the freedom to hunt. If not treated well, they rip their wouldbe masters apart and descend into the lightless depths of the ocean. Although able to breed, feeders in the depths give birth only to monstrosities or normal sharks, never to other feeders. A typical feeder in the depths is 24 feet long and weighs 5,500 pounds.
