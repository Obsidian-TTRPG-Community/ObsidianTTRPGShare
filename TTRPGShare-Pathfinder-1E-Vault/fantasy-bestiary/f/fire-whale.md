special_abilities:
  - name: Elemental Heart (Su)
    desc: A fire whale is empowered by a heart of pure elemental fire, granting it several elemental-like traits. A fire whale does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and it is immune to paralysis, poison, and sleep effects.
  - name: Flaming Body (Su)
    desc: A fire whale’s molten-hot flesh generates incredible heat. Anyone striking a fire whale with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a fire whale or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists.
  - name: Magma Spray (Ex)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a fire whale can spew a burst of magma and scalding ash from its blowhole in either a 90-foot cone or a 30-foot radius around the fire whale. This blast of magma and ash deals 9d6 points of fire damage and 9d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 27 half). Rubble and debris from this blast transform the terrain in the affected area into difficult terrain for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Fire whales are titanic beasts native to the Elemental Plane of Fire, but their natural ability to traverse the planes means they are seen across all the Elemental Planes and Material Plane. They travel in great pods, singing and feeding off whatever bits of metal and mineral catch their eyes, which their inner foundries refine into a glorious array of gems. The vast bounty of wealth their bellies contain has enticed the efreet to hunt fire whales for untold ages, and the enormous creatures return that antagonism by aggressively attacking genies of all types on sight. 

Though most at home in the searing heat of their native plane, fire whales can survive and even flourish on other planes. On the Material Plane, fire whales splash in the molten hearts of volcanoes, skim through the clouds, or cavort through deep ocean trenches as the whim strikes them. Their inner fires boil water, protecting them from the freezing cold of the ocean depths. The heat of their bodies even melts stone, allowing them to burrow through rock after a fashion.
