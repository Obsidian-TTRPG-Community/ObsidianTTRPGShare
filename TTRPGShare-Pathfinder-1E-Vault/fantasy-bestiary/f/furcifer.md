special_abilities:
  - name: Deleriant Aura (Ex)
    desc: A furcifer’s pollen induces euphoria and confusion, imposing a -2 penalty on Will saving throws on any creatures within 50 feet of the furcifer. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect.
  - name: Displacement (Su)
    desc: A furcifer’s illusory pollen constantly distorts its presence. It gains a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals its true location and negates the miss chance, and creatures immune to illusions or poison are immune to this effect.
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    desc: A furcifer can grab a foe with its tongue and draw the victim to its mouth. This tongue attack has a reach of 25 feet. The attack deals no damage but allows the furcifer to grab its target. A furcifer does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.
  - name: Utopia (Sp)
    desc: A furcifer is blessed with strange powers of illusion and can warp the world around it at will to seem idyllic and safe. This functions as a mirage arcana spell, though the furcifer’s simplistic intellect means it may create unusual or surreal illusions based on what its victims find appealing. Creatures in the affected area may recognize the landscape as unnatural with a successful DC 20 Will saving throw; otherwise, the furcifer’s powers lull them into accepting the impossible. Affected creatures cannot recognize any natural hazards in the area, and the furcifer itself appears as something harmless within the affected area, such as a flower-covered hill, quaint home, or friendly animal, making it effectively invisible; if the furcifer attacks, it immediately breaks the invisibility effect but does not end the mirage arcana effect. Creatures immune to illusions and mind-affecting effects are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Standing as tall as a house and draped in intoxicating blossoms, the furcifer is a bizarre synthesis of reptile and plant born from enormous surges of positive energy. Despite their inviting, vibrant hides, furcifers are ravenous predators, capable of warping the world around them into almost any placid scene and concealing themselves from ordinary senses. These abilities make them extraordinary ambush predators, and parties of human-sized travelers are easily picked off one by one from above thanks to the clever reptilian hunters’ long, prehensile tongues.

 Lazy and patient, these large reptiles sometimes lull whole caravans into complacency, letting them linger in false wonderlands for days or weeks as the furcifer picks off its prey one at a time. Furcifers are cantankerous and stubborn, and dispense with all subtlety to pursue prey relentlessly if it escapes their illusory paradise.

 Furcifers on average stand over 15 feet tall and 35 feet long thanks to their long, curled tails. Furcifers weigh up to 6-1/2 tons.
