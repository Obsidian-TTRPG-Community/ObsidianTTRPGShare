special_abilities:
  - name: Crush (Ex)
    desc: Ulunat uses its immense size as a formidable weapon. As a standard action, Ulunat can move over enemies or objects, using its whole body to crush them, dealing 20d6+30 points of damage. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents that are Huge or smaller. This attack affects as many creatures as fit in Ulunat’s space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless Ulunat moves off them. If Ulunat chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don’t escape. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Devour Magic (Ex)
    desc: Ulunat has the ability to absorb magic directed at it and create arcane feedback that has the potential to shred a spellcaster’s mind. Whenever Ulunat is targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by phantasmal killer. If Ulunat is in the area of effect of a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by insanity. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Hibernation (Ex)
    desc: Ulunat can sleep for centuries and doesn’t need to eat during these periods of dormancy, though it eats ravenously and almost constantly once it has been awakened. If Ulunat is forced into an inhospitable environment, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken. While in hibernation, Ulunat’s damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.
  - name: Massive (Ex)
    desc: Because of Ulunat’s size, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to its movement, though forests or settlements are considered difficult terrain. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square Ulunat occupies, and vice versa. Ulunat can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Ulunat gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It’s possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Ulunat with a successful DC 30 Climb check, however unlike the normal rules regarding Ulunat and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on Ulunat provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    desc: Like all Spawn of Rovagug, Ulunat is a nearly indestructible force. No form of attack can suppress Ulunat’s regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If Ulunat fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region from devastation, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug like Ulunat has yet to be discovered.
  - name: Terrible Claws (Ex)
    desc: Ulunat’s natural weapons ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.
  - name: Tremor Step (Ex)
    desc: Ulunat’s thunderous steps shake the ground as it moves. While moving along the ground, any creatures within 100 feet of Ulunat that are also in contact with the ground must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be knocked prone as the beast thunders along. The save DC is Strength-based.

## Description
Ulunat’s carapace towers above Sothis, creating what is now known as the Black Dome. The most exclusive part of the city, the Black Dome shields its district from the sun’s blazing heat and the desert’s blistering sandstorms. Beneath the Black Dome sit palaces and monuments, the most important of which is the seat of Sothis’s government and the home of the Ruby Prince.

 The stories from the beginning of the First Age of Osirion claim that Azghaad killed Ulunat-some even say that he achieved this feat with the divine help of Nethys-but the truth is that the Spawn of Rovagug are unkillable. After a lengthy and dangerous battle, Azghaad banished Ulunat to a pocket realm beneath the place where its bloated shell still stands. In this realm, under the oldest and largest settlement in Osirion, Ulunat sleeps.

 Before this ancient conflict, the great beast emerged from the Pit of Gormuz and thundered across Golarion. As Ulunat neared what is now Sothis, cultists of Rovagug channeling the power of raw chaos in a massive ritual- chanting cacophonous praises to the Rough Beast- opened a direct link between Ulunat and Rovagug. Empowered by this divine connection, Ulunat grew to an immense size and charged across the land, trampling everything in its path.

 Now, thousands of years later, the Unholy First has begun to stir in its prison. Numerous past attempts to free the Unholy First have failed, and most of these were hidden from the public and Osirion’s official history in hopes that the proper method for freeing Ulunat would remain unknown. However, this doesn’t stop cultists and doomsayers from trying to bring back the terrible beast.
