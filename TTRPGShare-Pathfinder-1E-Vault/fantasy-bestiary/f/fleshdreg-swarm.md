## Description
Fleshdreg swarms form from scraps and leftovers of malformed fleshdregs and incomplete sinspawn. These foul, misshapen creatures pour out of runewells by the hundreds, seeking sinful flesh to destroy. Little more than pests, these swarms attack indiscriminately. Some malfunctioning runewells and other fleshvats produce nothing more these days than swarm upon swarm of these pests.
