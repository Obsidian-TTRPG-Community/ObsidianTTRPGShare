special_abilities:
  - name: Shadowy Pelt (Su)
    desc: A fen mauler can swathe itself in shadows, allowing it to become nearly invisible while standing motionless. A fen mauler gains partial concealment on any round it does not move from its current space.
  - name: Swamp Stride (Ex)
    desc: A fen mauler can move through any sort of undergrowth and difficult terrain (such as briars, deep mud, and similar terrain) in swamps at normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
  - name: Trophy Hunter (Su)
    desc: As part of a 10-minute ritual, a fen mauler can harvest bones, teeth, flesh, or hide from an animal, humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid it has slain, creating a trophy. This trophy is a permanent magic item that functions only for the fen mauler that created it, granting some measure of the slain creature’s power to the fen mauler while carried or worn on its body. The fen mauler chooses which of the following powers the trophy grants: blindsense 30 feet, climb 30 feet, evasion, ferocity, grab, pounce, uncanny dodge, or a single energy immunity. Alternatively, a trophy can grant a +4 competence bonus to a single skill. The skill or ability modified must be one the trophy creature had in life, and a trophy imparting a skill bonus allows the fen mauler to attempt checks with that skill untrained. A fen mauler can maintain a number of trophies equal to its Wisdom modifier (3 for the standard fen mauler). The fen mauler presented here has not assigned any of its trophies.

## Description
Long ago, in the wake of terrible calamity, some populations of sasquatches embraced terrible rites and dark bargains to protect their homes, becoming fen maulers. While sasquatches only resort to violence when threatened, fen maulers revel in bloodshed and vindictive belligerence. All but invisible within their shadowy domains, fen maulers stalk victims for hours or days at a time, until they corner their lost and panicked prey and force a final, deadly confrontation.
