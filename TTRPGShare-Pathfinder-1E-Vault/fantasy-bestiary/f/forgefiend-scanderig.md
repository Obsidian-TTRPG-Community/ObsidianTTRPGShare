special_abilities:
  - name: Adamantine Bite (Ex)
    desc: A forgefiend’s bite attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Rend Armor (Ex)
    desc: When a forgefiend hits with a bite attack, it chews any armor worn by the target-this grants the forgefiend a free sunder attempt against armor worn by the target if the victim fails a DC 22 Reflex save. A forgefiend also gains Greater Sunder and Improved Sunder as bonus feats. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Searing Spew (Su)
    desc: A forgefiend can belch forth a searing pile of slag from its body maw as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This blob of molten metal affects any 10-foot-square area adjacent to the forgefiend. Any creature in this area takes 14d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 22 halves). The slag quickly cools, forming a rugged pile of worthless scrap and misshapen metal that is treated as difficult terrain-this stuff crumbles to powder in 1 hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Scanderigs, more commonly known as “forgefiends,” look like large, heavily armored, barrel-shaped giants, with enormous mouths in their bellies in addition to the normal-sized ones in their heads. They are native to the Plane of Earth, but sometimes make their way through subterranean portals onto the Material Plane, where they gorge themselves on rich and relatively uncontested mineral veins. A forgefiend might live quite happily inside a mountain’s heart for centuries, only causing trouble when the ore runs out or interlopers attempt to mine its territory. 

Forgefiends are particularly feared in many dwarven societies. In addition to their penchant for destroying deep forges, they are often portrayed as boogeymanlike figures for frightening dwarven children and instilling good smithing habits-for it is said, “For every scrap of slag you waste, a scanderig is making haste. Those who use excessive ore find forgefiends scratching at their door!”
