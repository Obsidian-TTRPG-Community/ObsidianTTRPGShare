    desc: A frost fir’s bark constantly exudes a sticky resin that aids its combat maneuvers and natural attacks. The resin grants a frost fir a +2 circumstance bonus on all disarm, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers, as well as on saving throws against effects that cause it to drop something it is holding. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir’s slam attack, deals damage to a frost fir with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise touches a frost fir (including with a grapple maneuver), must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir’s sticky resin. A creature affected by this resin takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and concentration checks (penalties from multiple contacts do not stack). Any enemy grappled by a frost fir takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape using the Escape Artist skill. Strong alcohol, universal solvent, or any amount of fire damage dealt to a creature coated in resin removes the resin. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Little known outside the colder climes and higher elevations of the world, the malevolent tree creatures known as frost firs keep to themselves and disdain any who intrude upon their forested realms. Prevailing theories among scholars suggest the species descended from treants long ago, a derivative offshoot with an exclusive affinity for evergreen trees. But despite sharing a common language, frost firs actually disdain treants, citing philosophical differences. This revelation has caused others to posit that frost firs originated as an entirely separate species, born of the enigmatic First World where plants walk and speak as freely as other creatures.

The grim-minded frost firs are as cold and impassive as the windswept ice and rocks they call home. They care little for other creatures or societies, keeping their distance at all times and actively driving away any who dare to approach their groves during a reproductive cycle. Frost firs also have an especial hatred for those who create or rely upon open flames for warmth. Northern travelers often tell tales of frost fir attacks on their caravans, usually initiated with a smothering, snowy assault on any campfires. These attacks always come at night, and the frost firs never relent until such interlopers completely withdraw from their lands.

Frost firs make staunch combatants, specializing in stealthy forms of guerrilla warfare. They often utilize pit traps to capture the unwary, or draw their victims into ambushes facilitated by their ability to appear as normal trees. After grappling and pinning opponents, frost firs often take them prisoner and escort them back to a frost fir grove to be butchered and used to fertilize the soil for frost fir young. Frost firs craft any remaining bones into crude trophies and gruesome signposts marking their territory and warning away others. As a result, few species treat with frost firs, and any act of Diplomacy with them automatically faces a starting attitude of unfriendly.
