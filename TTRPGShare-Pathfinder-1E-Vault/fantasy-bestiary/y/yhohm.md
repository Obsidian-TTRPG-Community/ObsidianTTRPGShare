special_abilities:
  - name: Holy Fire (Su)
    desc: Like a flame strike, half the fire damage from a yhohm’s fire attacks is fire damage; the other half is divine power and is not subject to fire immunity or resistance.
  - name: Self-Resurrection (Su)
    desc: A slain yhohm remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate. Otherwise, a fully healed yhohm emerges from the remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via resurrection. The yhohm gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs. A yhohm can self-resurrect only once per year. If a yhohm dies a second time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A yhohm that dies within the area of a desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the desecrate effect ends, at which point the yhohm immediately resurrects. A yhohm brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.
  - name: Shroud of Flame (Su)
    desc: A yhohm can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are burning, it deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within 5 feet must attempt a DC 14 Reflex save each round or take 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the yhohm with a natural or non-reach melee weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
A yhohm is a spirit of holy fire that serves the Dawnflower. According to the faithful, each time a phoenix is reborn, a portion of its soul incarnates in Nirvana as a yhohm. Eternally young and obsessed with life, a yhohm is a creature of healing, joyful song, and cleansing fire. While far less intimidating and wise than true phoenixes, yhohms prove far more carefree, as though a great weight has been lifted from their souls. Despite that, many yhohms also harbor a deep sadness, as though they have left some great work undone.

A yhohm looks like a white dove, but is as large as an eagle, with eyes like burning coals that shine with the light of the sun. The presence of evil fills it with righteous indignation. It does not need to eat, but enjoys the taste of roasted berries and nuts. A yhohm measures just under 2 feet long and weighs about 4 pounds.
