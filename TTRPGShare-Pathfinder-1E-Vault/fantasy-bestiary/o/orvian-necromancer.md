## Description
In their philosophy on life’s futility, urdefhans see being raised as an undead as a suitable punishment for enemies since it wrenches their souls from the sweet oblivion that awaits them beyond and forces their continued suffering on the Material Plane. Necromancers flourish among urdefhans, serving as jailers, mercenaries, and labor contractors.
