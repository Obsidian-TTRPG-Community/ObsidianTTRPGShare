He knows and can prepare any wizard spell from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook that doesn’t have the evil descriptor, any spell from pages 28 and 29 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths & Philosophies (casting these as though they were wizard spells of the highest level listed in their descriptions), and possibly others as well, including unique ones he’s researched.

    desc: Through the use of permanency, Jatembe is constantly under the effects of the following spells: arcane sight, darkvision, see invisibility, and telepathic bond (once with each of his Ten Magic Warriors).

## Description
No character looms larger in the myths of the Mwangi tribes than Old-Mage Jatembe. Jatembe rose to prominence in the Age of Anguish, a time when mankind was just beginning to recover from the devastation caused by Earthfall and the destruction of Azlant. Jatembe was the first among humanity to rediscover the art of wizardry and written magic, and did much to redeem these arts in the eyes of a superstitious people. Jatmebe worked tirelessly to stem the tide of barbarism left in the wake of the Age of Darkness, and preserve the learning and culture of his people. He is remembered as a folk hero among the Mwangi, and as a beacon of hope in a darkest of times.

Little is known about Jatembe’s origins. Even in the earliest of myths, he’s described as an old man. Some scholars point out parallels between Jatembe’s ageless nature and the immortal masters of the lost city of Ird, suggesting that fabled city as his birthplace, though the decadent and cruel lords of Ird have little else in common with him. Later accounts claim Jatembe and his disciples destroyed the city of Ird to punish it for its wickedness, casting doubt on this theory. Other myths connect Jatembe with the druids of the Mwangi Expanse, some even claiming he was an ex-druid himself. True or not, Jatembe did have an affinity for druidic magic, and the magical school he founded-the Magaambya-continues to teach druid spells to this day.

The details of Jatembe’s ascension are similarly occluded by millennia of myth and legend. One popular tale holds that Jatembe learned the deepest mysteries of magic from the severed head of Ydersius before sewing the serpent-god’s lips shut. Others claim he gained mythic knowledge from sources among the planes, for many tales tell of his dealings with angels, demons, and other outsiders while in search of ways to protect his people. Still more stories say that Jatembe found some potent artifact amid the ruins of the Mwangi that awakened his mythic potential, and that he departed Golarion once the strength of this artifact had faded.

Prior to his mysterious departure, Jatembe performed many astonishing deeds. The first of these was the gathering of his disciples, the Ten Magic Warriors. These men and women were known only by the golden animal masks they wore, having forsaken their identities in service to Jatembe and his quest. With their help, Jatembe explored the ancient ruins that dot the Mwangi Expanse, uncovering ancient magical secrets and treasures. He founded the city of Nantambu and the Magaambya arcane academy to preserve and share knowledge and wealth with future generations, and to protect the Expanse from further devastation such as that wrought by the Earthfall. In later days, Jatembe fought and defeated the twisted sorcerer known as the King of Biting Ants, who claimed to possess a weapon that would allow him to eat the sun and cast the world into darkness.

For reasons unknown, Jatembe departed Golarion; if anyone knows where he left to, they’re silent on the matter. Some believe he left to fulfill obligations to the beings who granted him mythic power, and others think a magnificent spell took him. He left his Ten Magic Warriors behind to rule in his place, and forged the Ring of Nine Facets (Artifacts and Legends 40) to aid them in his absence. He has created and used other artifacts in his travels, but gave them all away to allies, keeping only the beacon of true faith that one of his patrons gave him.
