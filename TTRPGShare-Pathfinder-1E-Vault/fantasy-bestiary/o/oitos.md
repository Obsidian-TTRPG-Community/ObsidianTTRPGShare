special_abilities:
  - name: Dark Traveler (Ex)
    desc: When an oitos uses plane shift to travel to the Shadow Plane or an evil-aligned plane, it arrives at its intended destination with complete accuracy. When an oitos uses shadow walk, it moves at a rate of 100 miles per hour.
  - name: Golden Bones (Su)
    desc: On a critical hit, an oitos attempts to bless the damaged creature with inner beauty. If the target fails at a DC 21 Fortitude save, the oitos turns the creature’s bones into magical, radiant gold. The target is immediately and permanently affected as per the spell faerie fire, and its Constitution is reduced by 4.

 At the start of every round this effect persists, the victim must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or its eyes are burned out from the inside, resulting in permanent blindness. This is a curse effect; the effects do not stack. The cleaned bones of a Medium creature affected by this ability are worth 1,000 gp. This value doubles for each size category an affected creature is larger than Medium, and it is halved for each size category a creature is smaller than Medium. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lash (Su)
    desc: An oitos can lash at foes with razor-sharp, animated strips of leather and silk. This is a primary natural attack that deals slashing damage.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Ex)
    desc: A creature that succumbs to an oitos’s unnerving gaze becomes nauseated for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
What is perfection without splendor? Oitos kytons know there is much more to seduction than audacities of the flesh. Oitoses tempt souls to drift willingly into their clutches. They have more discerning tastes than many of their brethren, though, seeking specific targets, whether those with a certain “flavor” of mortal experience or outsiders of particular magnificence. Tearing away their victims’ tawdry flesh, they exalt in the clean grandeur of bone gilded with precious metals. They present themselves as living treasures-beings capable of fulfilling the promise of any reward and embodiments of glories to come.
