  - name: Obscuring Fog (Sp)
    desc: An oneirogen is constantly surrounded by strangely colored fog that moves with it. Treat this as obscuring mist that fills the area within 10 feet of an oneirogen. A creature 5 feet away in the mist has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). An oneirogen cannot suppress this effect, and its vision is impeded the same as that of any other creature. If the fog is blown or burned away, it reforms in 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Planar Split (Ex)
    desc: An oneirogen is trapped between two planes, effectively harboring an active portal within its failing body. Having connections to multiple planes at once, an oneirogen is always affected by spells like dismissal and banishment, which force it to the plane to which its portal connects. Additionally, effects like dimensional anchor cut off an oneirogen’s connection to another plane. Such effects suppress the oneirogen’s obscuring fog and veil of mists abilities and make the oneirogen staggered.
  - name: Veil of Mists (Su)
    desc: Within the obscuring fog that cloaks an oneirogen lie denser eddies of planar potentiality. This fog is charged with extraplanar energies that manifest in a variety of ways depending on the plane to which the oneirogen is linked. While an oneirogen is immune to the effects of these vapors, any creature that enters the mists within 5 feet of the oneirogen is affected (see below). These fumes don’t impede vision any more than the oneirogen’s obscuring fog ability already does. They can also be blown or burnt away (and recover) in the same manner.

 Many oneirogens are linked to the Dimension of Dreams-they spew a sour, yellow fog. Creatures that enter this fog must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or fall asleep. Additionally, they do not receive natural healing from resting for the next 24 hours. The creature can attempt another Will save every round to wake up and can be woken up as if it had been affected by the spell sleep. Creatures that succeed at the save to resist this effect are immune to that oneirogen’s veil of mists for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Oneirogens were once normal mortals who suffered a rare but terrible curse. Within them lies a sliver-sized tear between planes, a crack hardly larger than a pinprick that destroys everything they once were in an endless deluge of planar power. Created by magical mistakes and otherworldly conjunctions, oneirogens wander in a haze as living husks whose grip on any reality has been erased. What little remains of their minds is bent on self-preservation, even as they are locked at the center of storms of strange powers endlessly streaming from their mouths and nostrils. The death of their personalities might be a mercy, but what lingers on are primal beings, slaves of uncontrolled planar might.

While the portal trapped within an oneirogen might connect to any plane of existence, it most commonly provides a path to the Dimension of Dreams. As mortal minds already drift toward that realm, breaches between the waking and unconscious worlds might occur when potent magics attempt to tamper with the boundaries of dream. The notorious tome, The Chain of Nights, is just one grimoire known to plumb the depths of thought and nightmare. Those who attempt to use such magic without full mastery, though, risk transforming themselves or those they would aid into drifters trapped between planes.

Some rare, unsettling reports tell of groups of oneirogens collecting in a single place, flooding the surrounding area with planar energies. The effects of such energies on the world surrounding them are unpredictable and usually deadly to native inhabitants.

Oneirogens might arise from any humanoid race, but always appear as mysterious figures cloaked in a strange haze or fog. These creatures rarely live for long, as their bodies swiftly wither from exposure to planar energies, and most lack enough sense of self to bother with eating or other basic needs. Only if protected and tended will an oneirogen live for more than a week.
