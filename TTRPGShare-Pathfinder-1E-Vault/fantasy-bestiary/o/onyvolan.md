  - name: Cowardly (Ex)
    desc: Though onyvolans love scaring others, they are quick to cower in the face of real resistance. Creatures gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks against an onyvolan.
  - name: Creepy Cackle (Ex)
    desc: As a free action, an onyvolan can let out a chilling laugh. Any non-onyvolan creature within 30 feet who can hear it must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be shaken for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to that onyvolan’s creepy cackle for 24 hours. Each subsequent failed saving throw against this effect increases the duration of the shaken condition but does not cause the creature to become frightened. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect.
  - name: Easily Hampered (Ex)
    desc: For an onyvolan, each square of difficult terrain counts as 4 squares of movement (rather than 2), and each diagonal move into a square of difficult terrain counts as 6 squares (rather than 3).
  - name: Nimble Charger (Ex)
    desc: An onyvolan receives a +2 racial bonus on bull rush and overrun combat maneuver checks and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when attempting such maneuvers.

## Description
Mischievous menaces of the streets, onyvolans are gangly, humanlike creatures with grotesquely long limbs that end in peculiar keratinous wheels, which the creatures use to roll along at high speeds. Onyvolans enjoy creating mayhem by roaming around in gangs and terrorizing a city’s residents, especially in older, rundown districts. Pure troublemakers at heart, onyvolans prefer mischief to actual violence, and they show their cowardly side whenever their quarry stands up to them. They trawl dump sites and trash piles in search of food and clothing, which is their primary means of obtaining both; however, they occasionally attack victims who seem to be carrying-or wearing-items of particular interest. Onyvolans love garish clothing that most people wouldn’t wear, and they especially adore ostentatious hats.

 Onyvolans’ arms are roughly the same length as their legs, allowing the creatures to reach the ground easily with their front wheels and roll on all fours, which is their natural stance. Onyvolans are eerily pale-skinned, and their mouths are nearly always twisted into a disturbing grin that reveals their pointed teeth; they find that their frightful countenances aid in putting their targets on edge.

 A typical onyvolan is about 7 feet tall from head to back wheel when upright and weighs about 170 pounds.
