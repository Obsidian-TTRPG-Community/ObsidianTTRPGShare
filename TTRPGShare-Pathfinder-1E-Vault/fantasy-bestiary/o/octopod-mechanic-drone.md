  - name: Crew Boss (Ex)
    desc: When working with other robots, an octopod mechanic drone can coordinate the group’s efforts to maximize efficiency. All other robots with 30 feet of an octopod mechanic drone gain a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and skill checks.
  - name: Integrated Laser Pistols (Ex)
    desc: An octopod mechanic drone has two integrated laser pistols with a range increment of 50 feet.
  - name: Mass Repair (Ex)
    desc: An octopod mechanic drone can use its tentacles to repair multiple robots at one time. As a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, an octopod mechanic drone can restore 3d10 hit points to itself and each allied robot within 10 feet of it.
  - name: Mechanical Expertise (Ex)
    desc: An octopod mechanic drone is programmed with deep knowledge of machinery. The octopod mechanic drone is considered trained in all skills used against a technology-based subject.
  - name: Reboot System (Ex)
    desc: An octopod mechanic drone can reboot a robot’s system, whether its own or an ally’s. As a standard action, an octopod mechanic drone can remove all of the following conditions from either itself or a robot within 10 feet of it: blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, shaken, sickened, and staggered.
  - name: Repair Station (Ex)
    desc: As a full-round action, an octopod mechanic drone can anchor its body to the ground, freeing its robotic tentacles to focus on attacking and repairing rather than supporting itself. While it is anchored, it loses its Dexterity bonus and dodge bonus to AC, it cannot move, and it gains a +8 enhancement bonus to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers. An anchored octopod mechanic drone doubles the number of hit points it restores using its mass repair ability, and it gains a +2 enhancement bonus on damage rolls with its slam attacks. Unanchoring itself from the ground is a full-round action.

## Description
Octopod mechanic drones are the ultimate in repair-robot technology. These multilimbed robots can manipulate each of their metal tentacles with extreme precision, allowing them to perform delicate fixes and repair many machines at once. Octopod mechanic drones also have the ability to anchor themselves to the ground, allowing them to commit their tentacles entirely to repair rather than having to use them for support. Owners of octopod mechanic drones often rely on the robots to manage the rest of their mechanical workers; the robots communicate more loudly and directly than others of their kind, making them natural leaders, and they have a distinct ability to coordinate the group for maximum efficiency.

 An octopod mechanic drone is about 6 feet tall, with tentacles roughly 10 feet long, and weighs approximately 750 pounds.
