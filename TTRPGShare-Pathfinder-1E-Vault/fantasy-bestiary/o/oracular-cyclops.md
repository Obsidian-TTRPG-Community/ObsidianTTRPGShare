## Description
A cyclops oracle retains more of the powers of foresight than most of its kin. In addition to a cyclops’s typical f lash of insight ability, an oracular cyclops can share its gift with others, granting them a boon on a future challenge. While often smaller than others of its kind, an oracular cyclops gains the ability to foresee danger coming its way. The statistics above depict a cyclops who is served by a cult of worshippers, and is therefore in good health. Other oracular cyclopes are sometimes kept as chained prisoners, at the mercy of their captors.
