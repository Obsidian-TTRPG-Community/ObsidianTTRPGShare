special_abilities:

    desc: Hell gigas charge any rocks they throw with explosive energy. Wherever a rock thrown by a Hell gigas lands, it explodes in a 30-foot burst of flame that deals 1d6 points of fire damage for every three Hit Dice the gigas possesses (Reflex DC 27 for half ). This is in addition to any damage caused by the thrown rock. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Planar Empowerment (Su)
    desc: While on the plane of Hell, a Hell gigas gains access to earthquake (DC 25), firestorm (DC 25), and unholy aura as spell-like abilities, each usable once per day. If the gigas ventures onto another plane, it cannot make use of these abilities (though its other spell-like abilities remain available). The save DC for the spell-like abilities is Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial bonus.

desc_short: A giant like a mountain of corpses thunders into view. Armor crafted from the twisted bones of a hundred gigantic victims girds a twisted humanoid body covered in angry red burns and the jagged scars of crippling battles. Despite its wounds, the surviving figure exerts a terrible strength, hefting its grisly armor with ease.

## Description
The giants of the Pit, Hell gigas roam the hinterlands of Hell, stalking forth from ruined, millennia-old fortresses to enslave those who slip through the grasp of devilkind. Called “phyriphlegeians” by titans and some of the other elder races of the multiverse, these arrogant and most ancient of giants care only for their own tyrannies, petty schemes made abominable by their masters’ scale, strength, and disregard for the survival of all other beings. More than capable of personally ruining most of their own foes physically, Hell gigas prefer campaigns of fear and pain, expending legions of slaves before bringing their own monstrous might to bear upon thoroughly defeated foes-though their rage often provokes them to forgo more satisfying climaxes in favor of immediate destruction.

The typical Hell gigas stands well over 50 feet tall and weighs upward of 20 tons, in addition to the weight of its armor of bone and metal.
