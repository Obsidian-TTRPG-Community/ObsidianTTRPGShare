## Description
On the border between Xa Hoi and Nagajor, near the caldera of Mount Kumijinja, a cave system leads deep into the Darklands. The locals call it the Clicking Caverns, for scouts report seeing strange clockwork warriors creeping out of the caves at night in search of living creatures. Deep beneath those caves is the clockwork necropolis of Pan Majang, a constantly transforming edifice that houses the sadistic, flesh-eating spirits of a forgotten race. These spirits now possess and haunt the constructs they once used as slaves.

 A haunted construct is formed when a soul does not continue to Pharasma’s Spire and is instead drawn to an existing construct in a desperate attempt to continue living. Often malevolent and cruel, these souls seek to inflict harm on the living and invite them to join in their tortured existence.

 The sample haunted construct above uses a scarecrow as the base creature. See that entry for full descriptions of its base abilities.
