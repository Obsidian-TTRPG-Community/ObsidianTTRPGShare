special_abilities:
  - name: Channel Negative Energy (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a hollow serpent can channel negative energy in a 30-foot burst just like a 16th-level cleric of an evil deity. This ability requires no divine focus. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Desiccation Aura (Su)
    desc: A cloud of negatively charged dust fills the air in a 30-foot radius around the body of a hollow serpent, causing living creatures within the area to make a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Charisma damage. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected again by the same hollow serpent’s desiccation aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Life-Draining Coils (Su)
    desc: A hollow serpent seethes with negative energy capable of draining the life force of creatures trapped within its coils. While holding such victims, the hollow serpent’s constrict ability bestows one negative level per round. The hollow serpent also gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it bestows.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    desc: A hollow serpent notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.

desc_short: An unseen breeze stirs the desiccated scales of this immense snakeskin, causing the shedding’s frayed, dried edges to flutter with a semblance of life. Pinpoints of unholy green light flare behind the intact eye lenses as the head starts to rise. The same glow behind those long-dead eyes illuminates a gaping mouth and bony fangs. Then a terrifying, painful hiss assaults your mind as the serpent slithers forward with a silent, unearthly grace.

## Description
Among the many manifestations of serpentfolk faith, the hollow serpent represents one of the most horrific harbingers of doom. Serpentfolk legend suggests Ydersius created the first hollow serpents as protectors and guardians for their underground enclaves. But serpentfolk priests soon learned how to make more, worshiping and cultivating the skin sheddings of monstrously giant snakes with rituals to turn them into engines of destruction. Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk, proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years of the serpentfolk’s age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually, however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the serpentfolk elite.

A typical hollow serpent measures a little over 15 feet long and weighs 500 pounds. A lesser hollow serpent is 7 feet long and weighs just 90 pounds.
