tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The honored of Kaoling depends on his mount to track down foes. If a fight seems likely, he casts bull’s strength and magic weapon.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The honored of Kaoling moves to be adjacent to the most powerful foe as soon as possible, preferring to fight in melee without his mount. If this isn’t a realistic option, he remains mounted and uses his longbow. If badly injured, the honored of Kaoling seeks to fall back long enough for his regeneration to heal him.
