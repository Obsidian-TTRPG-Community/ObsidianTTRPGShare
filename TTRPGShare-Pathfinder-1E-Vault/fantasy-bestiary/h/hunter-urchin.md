## Description
Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via ocean currents or, more commonly, tides.

Hunter Urchins: These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like tongues that can whip out and pull food to them.

Spear Urchins: These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over to feed.

Glass Urchins: So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to the potent hallucinatory effects of this urchin’s venom.
