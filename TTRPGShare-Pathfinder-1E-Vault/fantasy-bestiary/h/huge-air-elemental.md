## Description
Air elementals are fast, flying creatures made of living air. Primitive and territorial, they resent being summoned or doing the bidding of mortals, and much prefer to spend their time on the Plane of Air, swooping and racing through the endless skies.

Although all air elementals of a similar size have identical statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary wildly between individuals. One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings.

An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground. An air elemental can move underwater, and although it is an elemental and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in Swim and loses much of its speed and mobility when underwater.
