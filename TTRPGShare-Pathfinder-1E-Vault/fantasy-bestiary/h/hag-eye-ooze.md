  - name: Spell Channel (Su)
    desc: A hag creator of a hag eye ooze can see through the embedded hag eye as if she were looking from the ooze directly. This ability requires that the hag creator and the hag eye ooze be on the same plane in order to function. If the hag that created the hag eye ooze is part of a coven, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through a hag eye ooze: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, message, read magic, and tongues. A non-hag that controls a hag eye ooze can’t cast spells through the ooze, nor can it see through the creature, but it can target the hag eye ooze with a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and view through it in that manner.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    desc: A hag eye ooze can create a powerful suction against any surface it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. It can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a hag eye ooze gains a +10 bonus to its CMD to resist bull rush attacks, awesome blow attacks, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    desc: A hag eye ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A successful DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a hag eye ooze. Any creature that fails to notice it and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the hag eye ooze’s slam attack.

desc_short: A single eye stares unblinking from an amorphous blob. A transparent pseudopod extends from the mass, ready to strike.

## Description
Some hags create hag eye oozes to serve as scouts and spies, favoring them over humanoid servants due to the ease of control. With their ability to blend in with their surroundings and climb nearly any surface, these creatures patrol the hag’s lair and surrounding territory. Hag eye oozes seem to be imbued with a sliver of the cautious side of their creator’s personality, watching intruders from a distance and avoiding combat unless directed to attack. Once given a command, these creatures pursue their goal mindlessly until a countermand is given. 

Hag eye oozes have gelatinous, transparent bodies that can sometimes grow larger than 5 cubic feet, though most are smaller, taking up roughly half that space. To date, no specimens have been found weighing more than 500 pounds.
