  - name: Adaptive Defense (Su)
    desc: When first encountered, a jubjub bird has no energy resistance. When damaged by an attack that causes cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, it gains resistance 30 to that energy type until the end of its next turn. If an attack causes more than one type of energy damage, the jubjub bird gains resistance 30 to all the types of energy damage dealt.
  - name: Deadly Bite (Ex)
    desc: A jubjub bird applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its bite attack. A successful critical hit decapitates and instantly slays a Large or smaller victim (DC 33 Fortitude negates decapitation; creatures without a head are immune to this effect) and deals triple normal damage regardless of the decapitation result. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Planar Acclimation (Ex)
    desc: A jubjub bird is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.
  - name: Shriek (Ex)
    desc: Once every 1d6 rounds as a standard action, a jubjub bird can voice a piercing screech. All creatures (other than jubjub birds) within a 60-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
The jubjub bird is a rare and dangerous bird that resembles a giant dodo bird, but with long, muscular legs and wings that provide functional, if awkward, flight. When attacked with magic, a jubjub bird’s plumage shifts randomly in hue and pattern with each spell hurled against it.

Like the bandersnatch and other legendary creatures such as the jabberwock, the jubjub bird originally hails from the primal world of the fey. It has the dubious honor of being the least powerful and least intelligent of these creatures, which are known collectively as the “Tane,” yet one should never assume that the jubjub bird is a pushover-its penchant for snapping off heads with its razor-sharp beak can quickly put such ideas to rest.

Powerful fey sometimes keep jubjub birds as guardians, and there are even reports of giants (particularly powerful tribes of jungle giants) using them as mounts. Such avian allies must be carefully trained, for few giants and fey are able to comfortably exist alongside a creature so prone to uttering such stunning shrieks so often.

Jubjub birds stand about 20 feet tall and weigh roughly 6,000 pounds.
