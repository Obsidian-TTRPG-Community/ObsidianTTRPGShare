special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Madness (Su)
    desc: Once per round, any creature within a 60-foot radius of the vespergaunt must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature successfully saves, it cannot be affected by the same vespergaunt’s aura again for 24 hours. As a free action, the vespergaunt can suppress its aura. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Damage Reduction (Su)
    desc: Weapons that are chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned overcome a vespergaunt’s damage reduction.
  - name: Siphon Spirit (Su)
    desc: Any creature struck by a vespergaunt must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or gain 1 negative level as the vespergaunt rips away a portion of its soul. A divine spellcaster gains an additional negative level with each failed save. A creature killed by this attack disintegrates except for its eyes and strands of brain matter, which become part of the vespergaunt. Only powerful magic such as miracle, true resurrection, or wish can resurrect a creature slain in this manner. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Often called “heresy oozes,” vespergaunts are emissaries of the horrible god-things of deep space and are found primarily on befouled, remote planets. 

A vespergaunt is 8 feet tall and 6 feet wide, and weighs just 50 pounds.
