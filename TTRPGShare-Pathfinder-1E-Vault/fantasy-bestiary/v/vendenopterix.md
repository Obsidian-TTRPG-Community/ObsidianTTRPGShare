special_abilities:
  - name: Ability Drain (Su)
    desc: A vendenopterix drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the vendenopterix can use this ability. The vendenopterix’s kiss inflicts 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma drain (her choice). The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion from the vendenopterix. The target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save to negate the suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Claw-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Swift Tracker (Ex)
    desc: A vendenopterix can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20 penalty) when moving at up to twice her normal speed while tracking.

## Description
Beautiful, seductive, and ruthless, vendenopterixes are servitors of Calistria tasked with hunting down and punishing enemies of the faith. Though they typically take female form, vendenopterixes are comfortable taking the shape of any gendered humanoid (including polygendered creatures) but avoid genderless shapes. A vendenopterix’s purpose is to punish, but not necessarily to kill. She may be tasked with exposing a creature’s secrets or convincing a creature to do so itself in an embarrassing way, and she is just as likely to drain her victim’s mental facilities until it acts like a buffoon or clod as she is to poison her target so it appears to be aff licted with (or even dying from) a venereal pox. Vendenopterixes stand about 6 feet tall and range in weight from a slender 140 pounds to a curvaceous 240.
