special_abilities:
  - name: Chaos Aura (Su)
    desc: A vescavor queen is an embodiment of chaos. Its aura is a font of anarchic energy that grants fast healing 2 to the vescavor queen, as well as to any vescavor swarm within 10 feet of the queen. A vescavor queen can activate or suppress this ability as a free action.
  - name: Gibber (Su)
    desc: Like their broods, vescavor queens yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor queen must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves can’t be affected by the same vescavor queen’s gibbering for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Spit Acid (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a vescavor queen can make a ranged touch attack to spit acid at a foe within 30 feet. A target hit by this glob of acid takes 5d6 points of acid damage. In addition, the spit of a vescavor queen contains some of its pheromones. Any target that takes damage from this attack acts as a beacon for vescavor swarms; the damaged creature takes a -8 penalty on Stealth checks against the vescavor queen and swarms it controls, and likely becomes the swarm’s next target.
  - name: Swarm Mother (Su)
    desc: A vescavor queen can mentally control up to 20 Hit Dice of vescavor swarms through a combination of pheromones and supernatural manipulation. To control a vescavor swarm, the vescavor queen must be able to see it and must be within 120 feet of it. Attempting to control a vescavor swarm is a standard action, and the swarm can attempt to resist this attempt with a DC 17 Will save. If the swarm fails this save, the vescavor queen can issue a simple mental command as a swift action, such as ”fight,” ”come here,” ”go there,” or ”stay still.” Vescavor swarms affected by this ability act normally unless a vescavor queen is actively controlling them, but never attack the vescavor queen. The save DC is Charisma-based. In addition, whether or not it controls the swarm, a vescavor queen is immune to a vescavor swarm’s swarm attacks and supernatural special abilities. A vescavor queen can release a vescavor swarm from its control as a free action. If a vescavor queen is killed, any vescavor swarms under its control disperse.

## Description
Appearing as an amalgam of twisted, unnatural insects, a vescavor queen is a hideous sight to behold, even among the terrifying denizens of the Abyss. Not only is a queen’s bite stronger than that of its spawn, but the queen can also spit acid at opponents, and its arms end in scything claws poised to rend through f lesh and armor. Vescavor swarms instinctively obey a queen, eagerly seeking out those foes marked by the queen’s attacks. A vescavor queen measures roughly 10 feet from head to tail, and weighs nearly 500 pounds- more when carrying a brood.
