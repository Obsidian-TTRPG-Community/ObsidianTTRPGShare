  - name: Slime Cloud (Ex)
    desc: While underwater, as a free action, a Varisian hagfish can secrete slime that transforms a 5-foot cube of water into a transparent cloud of viscous slime. This slime is the aquatic equivalent of rough terrain, and creatures swimming through it expend 2 squares of movement. The slime cloud remains for 10 rounds before dissipating. Hagfish are unaffected by these slime clouds. The slime also grants the hagfish a +4 bonus on grapple checks.
