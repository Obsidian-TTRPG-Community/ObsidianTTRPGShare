    desc: The faces between a kithangian’s claws have long rasping tongues covered with tiny teeth. Whenever a kithangian successfully grapples a foe with its claws, a rasping tongue slithers out from the face within and burrows into the creature’s body. Each round that the creature is grappled, it takes 1d6 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage as its sense of self-identity is warped and twisted. A successful DC 18 Will save negates the Charisma damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Kithangians, also known as beast demons, are reprehensible monstrosities born from the souls of those who abused and tormented animals in life. Universally male, the sudden spread of fiendish elements through within an area’s fauna is a sure indication of a kithangian’s presence in a region. The fact that most creatures that birth litters of young with the half-fiendish template die in the process is of little concern to the kithangian, for it merely moves on to new hunting grounds when uncorrupted animal victims grow too rare.
