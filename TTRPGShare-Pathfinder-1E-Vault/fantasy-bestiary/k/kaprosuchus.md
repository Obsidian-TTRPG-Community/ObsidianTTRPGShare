  - name: Ramming Snout (Ex)
    desc: When a kaprosuchus charges, it can ram an opponent with the calcified tip of its snout. This attack has the same attack bonus as the kaprosuchus’s bite attack, and it deals an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the kaprosuchus’s bite damage. If the attack is successful, the kaprosuchus can attempt a trip combat maneuver against the target as a free action.

## Description
Despite its close resemblance to other types of crocodilians, the kaprosuchus is a terrestrial predator, not an aquatic one. Squat and powerfully built, these creatures hunt for prey in forests. The adults can grow up to 20 feet long and weigh as much as 2,500 pounds.
