special_abilities:
  - name: Narrow Flight (Ex)
    desc: When airborne, kongamatos can fold their wings around their bodies to fit through tight spaces. While flying, kongamatos can fit through areas up to half their width without suffering the penalties to movement and Armor Class and on attack rolls usually incurred for squeezing.
  - name: Piercing Beak (Ex)
    desc: A kongamato’s beak is extremely hard and adept at breaking objects. When attempting to sunder an item, a kongamato’s beak attack does double damage and is treated as if it were adamantine for the purposes of overcoming the object’s hardness.
  - name: Wailing Dive (Su)
    desc: When a kongamato makes a charge while flying or uses its Flyby Attack feat, the creature’s body becomes infused with energy, causing its bite to do an extra +1d6 points of sonic damage on that attack.

    desc: 88
desc_short: A reptilian creature dives from the sky with a piercing scream. As it hits the ground, wings the width of sails throw up dirt and leaves. The creature’s draconic body tapers to an unmistakably birdlike head with a backward sweeping crest and a beak that resembles a giant military pick. As it moves, the air around it thrums with a high-pitched wail.

## Description
Kongamatos are primeval dragons that still hunt the deep jungles of the world. Although not as intelligent or magically adept as their “true” cousins, kongamatos are respected and feared for their resilience and awesome strength. While the kongamato’s body is clearly draconic- squat and dense with sharp claws capping each of its four limbs-the creature’s head is distinctly avian, with a long, toothless beak and a pronounced crest. A kongamato’s hide is a rich emerald hue, with an ash-colored underbelly, and crimson webbing of its broad wings. Females have smaller head-crests than males, and both the undersides of their wings and their underbellies have a rosy hue.

Both males and females grow to a length of almost 30 feet, with an equally broad wingspan, and can weigh up to 7 tons. Kongamatos live between 500 and 600 years.
