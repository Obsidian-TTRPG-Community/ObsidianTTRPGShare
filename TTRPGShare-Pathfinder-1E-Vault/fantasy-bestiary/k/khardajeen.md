special_abilities:
  - name: Darkvision Adaptation (Ex)
    desc: A creature using darkvision has a 50% miss chance when targeting a khardajeen. Creatures using regular sight or other means of vision or detection do not take this penalty.
  - name: Manifest Gems (Su)
    desc: As a swift action, a khardajeen can turn some of its liquid body into a hardened, gemlike structure. These gems appear at the ends of its four tentacles. A manifested gem lasts indefinitely, or until dismissed as a swift action. Manifested gems have a hardness of 10, 25 hit points, and AC 22. A destroyed gem cannot be reformed for 1 round. A manifested gem grants the khardajeen an ability based on its coloration. Only one gem of each color can be manifested at a time. Manifested gems are otherwise treated as ongoing spell effects, counting as 6th-level spells. The khardajeen is considered caster level 14th for the purposes of its gem abilities.

 Blue-While manifested, this gem grants the ability to shoot a ray as a ranged touch attack against a creature within 120 feet. A creature struck by the ray takes 6d6 points of cold damage.
 Dusty Rose-While manifested, this gem grants a +4 insight bonus to AC.
 Green-As per blue, but deals 6d6 points of acid damage.
 Orange-While this gem is manifested, ray attacks with manifested gems deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.
 Pale Lavender-While manifested, this gem can absorb a single spell of 6th level or lower as an immediate action. It then dulls for 1d4 rounds. While dulled, this gem cannot be dismissed and cannot absorb spells.
 Pearly White-While manifested, this gem grants fast healing 5. It also grants resistance 10 against energy types associated with manifested red, green, blue, or topaz gems.
 Red-As per blue, but deals 6d6 points of fire damage.
 Topaz-As per blue, but deals 6d6 points of electricity damage.
  - name: Powerful Tentacles (Ex)
    desc: A khardajeen’s tentacles are primary natural attacks.
  - name: Ray Mastery (Ex)
    desc: A khardajeen can make as many ranged attacks in a round as it has manifested gems that provide ray attacks, to a maximum of four. Ranged ray attacks from manifested gems do not provoke attacks of opportunity. A tentacle making a ray attack in a round cannot be used to make a melee attack.

## Description
The true name of these creatures is one of Golarion’s many forgotten mysteries. The name “khardajeen” is rough and ancient Dwarven for something akin to “scourge of the deep.” These aberrant creatures silently float throughout the tunnels of the Darklands. They are attracted to sites of great antiquity, particularly the treasure troves of dwarven Darklands kingdoms and the deeper Orvian depths. A khardajeen is a shifting mass of gray flesh and thick, multicolored blood that stretches roughly 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 250 pounds.
