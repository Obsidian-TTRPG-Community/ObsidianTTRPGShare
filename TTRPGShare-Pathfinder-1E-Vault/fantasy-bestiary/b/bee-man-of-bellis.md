special_abilities:
  - name: Apian Emissaries (Sp)
    desc: The Bee-Man can use bees to duplicate the effect of pryings eye or whispering wind at will (caster level 13th). A successful DC 15 Perception check identifies the presence of the bees that act as the sensors for these spells, but a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check is required to realize they are behaving under outside influence.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Type injury (slam); save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Swarmlike (Ex)
    desc: The Bee-Man exists as a hive mind controlling a body of swarming bees. He is immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells). This immunity doesn’t apply to spells and effects generated by the Bee-Man himself, nor to mind-affecting effects that target single creatures. The Bee-Man takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects. He is also susceptible to high winds and is treated as a Diminutive creature for the purposes of determining wind effects. The Bee-Man can be targeted by spells as if he were a creature of the vermin type.
  - name: Taboo Name (Su)
    desc: Whenever the Bee-Man’s full name (Vernon Vestha) is spoken within 13 miles, he hears it as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance. He also learns the speaker’s direction and distance.

## Description
Vernon Vestha was a forest oracle obsessed with bees, reading the future in the patterns of their flight. Driven mad by a desire to internalize the bees’ powers of divination, he became one with his beloved bees in some honeyed rite. Now a living swarm in the rough semblance of a man, Vernon still roams the forests near Bellis, and some still seek out the ex-druid’s wisdom by calling his name (Knowledge [local] DC 20 to know). He often appears when he is called, though he seldom grants favors without exacting a terrible price.
