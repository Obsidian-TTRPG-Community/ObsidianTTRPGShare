special_abilities:
  - name: Pipes (Su)
    desc: A satyr can focus and empower his magic by playing haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a successful DC 18 Will save or be affected by charm person, fear, sleep, or suggestion, depending on which tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes’ effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the satyr’s other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr’s use of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spell-like abilities, and if separated from them, he may continue to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
The forest of Fangwood dominates the nation of Nirmathas. The country depends on the mighty wood for its security and economy, yet in its thick and shadowy depths lurks an oppressive curse. Where the pine trees grow tall and thick, the dryad Arlantia reigns. A pawn of the demon lord Cyth-V’sug, she is infected by the insidious tendrils of the Prince of the Blasted Heath. A magical breach forged by this curse connects the demon lord’s realm, the Jeharlu, to Golarion and to the First World itself. Arlantia infects trees with demonic ichor that warps the fey creatures who reside in the heart of Fangwood, and she takes advantage of the conf lict and war that wracks Nirmathas to create an army of thorncrowned daughters and other rot-infested horrors to consume the forest from within.

The blight manifests as a black and greasy fungal rot that moves and sways tree branches and limbs where no wind propels them, and a mystic network of fell power extends an unnatural awareness between nearby blighted fey. Dryads are by far the most insidious of the corrupted fey; they lure humanoids to literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their dark embrace- and further spread the disease. The dryads connect through a unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary limitations and permits them to treat every infected tree as if it were their own bonded tree.

Only magic such as miracle, limited wish, or wish can sever the connection to the Jeharlu and cure a blighted fey. Some speculate that a magical linchpin exists within Fangwood, which if destroyed would end this hideous plague.
