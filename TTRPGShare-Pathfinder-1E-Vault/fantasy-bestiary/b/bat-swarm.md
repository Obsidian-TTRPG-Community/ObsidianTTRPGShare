## Description
Bat swarms dwell in large caves, ruins, or even city sewers-anywhere they can find darkness to hide in during the day and a supply of food to feast upon at night. They are only encountered outside in a group at dawn or dusk, or when they have been startled and forced to flee their lairs.
