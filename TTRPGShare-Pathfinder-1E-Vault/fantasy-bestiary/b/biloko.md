    desc: Biloko can gradually insinuate their desires into the minds of those in the power of their charm person spell-like ability. For every 10 minutes a humanoid is under the influence of a biloko’s charm person, the victim takes a -1 penalty on her opposed Charisma check (to a maximum of -5) when the biloko is trying to convince her to do something she would not normally do. This penalty applies to the charm of only a single biloko and is reduced back to 0 as soon as the victim breaks free or the spell ends.

## Description
Blood-red man-eaters and cunning jungle stalkers, biloko hunt those who think themselves hunters, preying upon foolish travelers and incautious jungle natives with maniacal zeal. Lanky and quick humanoids, biloko possess exaggerated, fearfully expressive facial features, including mouths capable of stretching impossibly wide. Adept at blending in amid jungle underbrush despite their brilliant coloration, these ferocious jungle fey delight in constructing deadly traps, tricking victims into deadly ambushes, and leading enthralled foes into dangerous situations.

The average biloko stands between 3 and 4 feet tall and weighs between 40 and 50 pounds, though a biloko who has recently fed might bear the weight of a far greater creature.
