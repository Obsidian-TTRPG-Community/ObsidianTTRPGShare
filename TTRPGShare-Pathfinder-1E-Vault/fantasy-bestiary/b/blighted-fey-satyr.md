## Description
In certain wilderness regions, strange corruptions of nature fester and grow where the boundaries between this world and the Abyss grow thin. Dangerous and evil fungal creatures rise to power in these blighted reaches, such as sinister fungus queens (page 130) or legions of undead spore zombies (page 287), but when fey creatures become infused with this corruption and are themselves blighted, the resulting monstrosities are particularly vile. 

The typical Abyssal blight manifests as a black and greasy fungal rot that sways tree branches and limbs where no wind propels them, and a mystic network of fell power extends an unnatural awareness between nearby blighted fey. Dryads are often the most insidious of these corrupted fey; they lure humanoids to literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their dark embrace- and further spread the disease. The dryads connect through a unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary limitations and permits them to treat all infected trees as their own bonded trees. 

Only magic such as miracle, limited wish, or wish can sever the connection to the Abyss and cure a blighted fey, restoring the creature to its uncorrupted state if it fails to resist the transformation with a successful Will saving throw against the spell in question. Of course, once the blight takes hold, a fey creature is corrupted not only in body but in mind as well, and any attempts to cure such a fey creature are bound to be met with violence. 

The process of creating a blighted fey can vary. In some cases, the transformation requires a new fey creature to be bound in blighted fungal tendrils and to languish within the corrupted region for 24 hours, but in other cases the blight might affect a creature almost instantaneously. The potential to resist such corruption with a successful saving throw varies, as does the DC to resist such an effect. A wish, limited wish, or miracle can transform a fey creature into a blighted fey in much the same way this magic can be used to rescue a blighted creature from its corruption. 
 
Although the ooze creatures known as blights share a name with the planar corruption that creates blighted fey, these two types of creatures do not get along. In fact, blights often see the advance of an Abyssal incursion into their natural territory as much of an affront as the encroachment of mortal civilization, and in such cases those who oppose either group can sometimes find allies in the enemies of their enemy. Blights are usually the more difficult of the two to reach an accord with, but one should always tread with caution when dealing with the blighted fey.
