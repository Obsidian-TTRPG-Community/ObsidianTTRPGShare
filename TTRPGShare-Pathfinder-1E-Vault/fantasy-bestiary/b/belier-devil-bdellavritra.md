    desc: When a belier devil uses its magic jar spell-like ability, it can identify and pinpoint life forces accurately, allowing it to select its victims with ease. It does not require a receptacle to use magic jar. If it uses magic jar on a host while on the Material Plane, its own body becomes ethereal for the duration of the possession and the magic jar effect lasts until the effect is dispelled, the devil ends the effect, it is forced out of its host body, or it or its host body is slain.

## Description
Masterful possessors and foul manipulators, belier devils are among the most feared masterminds of Hell. Known as bdellavritras to devilkind, these worm-like fiends avoid physical confrontation. Instead, they target influential individuals for possession, using them to manipulate events by proxy. If their schemes are uncovered, the devils retaliate with all the power at their host bodies’ disposal. 

A bdellavritra’s voice can emanate from its worm-like maw, from any of its human-like mouths, or from all four at once, as it desires. Each mouth has its own distinct voice, often pleasing to the human ear. Bdellavritras typically reach lengths of 16 feet from worm-mouth to human heads, and weigh 3,000 pounds.
