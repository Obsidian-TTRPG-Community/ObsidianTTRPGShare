special_abilities:
  - name: Awlspines (Ex)
    desc: Once per minute as a standard action, a bloodplate burster can supercharge its circulatory system to forcefully project keratinous dorsal spines, dealing 6d10 points of piercing damage to adjacent creatures (Reflex DC 20 half) and applying its hydraulic surge ability to creatures that take damage from the attack. Mud, soil, and similar materials do not block line of effect or provide cover from awlspines. When burrowing as a move action, a bloodplate burster can make an awlspines attack at any point during the move. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Hydraulic Surge (Ex)
    desc: A bloodplate burster that deals damage to a target with an awlspines attack or a tentacle attack forces pressurized fluids into its prey, dealing 2d8 additional points of acid damage and sickening the target for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 20 negates). Further applications of this effect extend its duration. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Rupture (Ex)
    desc: A bloodplate burster’s hydraulic assault can raise its prey’s internal pressure to catastrophic levels. Creatures slain by the bloodplate burster’s hydraulic surge ability explode, dealing 3d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 20 half) to other creatures within a 15-foot-radius burst of the slain creature. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Fearsome subterranean predators, bloodplate bursters are naturally armored rhizomes that resemble long and tapered ginger roots. A hunting adult’s bulbous back is covered by shingled layers of withered, spade-shaped leaves. Thick sheets of fibrous growth coat its lower body, from which sprout hundreds of pale, finger-width cilia. Vines like the rigging of a ship run from its sightless “head” toward its posterior, and fist-sized stomata peek from leaves and appendages across its form.

 Bloodplate bursters are known for their sudden, terrifying appearances. The first sign of a burster is often a pack animal’s panicked cry. The monster’s hissing emergence is usually followed shortly by its target’s viscerally explosive death.

 An average adult bloodplate burster is over 6 feet tall and 12 feet long and weighs around 6,000 pounds.
