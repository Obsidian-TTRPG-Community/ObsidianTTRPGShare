special_abilities:
  - name: Force of Nature (Su)
    desc: A birelu channels the raw power of nature into its attacks. Its natural attacks are considered to have the ghost touch special ability, and each of its natural attacks deals an additional 2d6 points of force damage. This damage is doubled when a birelu makes a powerful charge.
  - name: Spirit Walk (Su)
    desc: Once per round as a standard action, a birelu can merge itself with a single humanoid or animal. This ability is similar to the magic jar spell (caster level 13th), except it doesn’t require a receptacle. To use this ability, the birelu must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same birelu’s spirit walk ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Additionally, a creature affected by this ability undergoes a physical transformation, growing either more beastlike or more humanlike, depending on its original form. A humanoid affected by this ability is affected as by greater animal aspectUC. The birelu chooses the aspect gained from this effect. This aspect can’t be changed, though the birelu can select a new aspect if it merges with the same creature again at a later time. An animal affected by the spirit walk ability is affected as by anthropomorphic animalUM. Either effect lasts for as long as the creature remains possessed by the birelu, ending once the birelu leaves the creature’s body.

desc_short: This figure seems caught at the moment of transformation between human and animal. Though its bearded face seems like a man’s, its head is crowned with a rack of antlers, and its hunched body is covered in patches of sleek black fur.

## Description
In ages past, humans didn’t live apart from nature as they do now. They had no cities, no farms, and no metal tools. In this primitive time, humans lived as beasts, hunting and foraging in the savage wild, living and dying by the cruel whims of nature. To these early humans, a successful hunt sometimes meant the difference between the life of the tribe and utter extinction. For this reason, the land and the animals who lived on it commanded great respect among the tribes. The environment represented more than just food or clothing or territory; it was an ally, an enemy, or even a god unto itself.

There was need in those days for people who could pass from the physical world and into the world of the spirits, where they could intercede with the spirits of the land and the animals to ensure the tribe’s survival. From this need came the birelus, manifestations of humankind’s desire to bridge the boundary between humans and nature. These ancient beings served as guardians and travelers of the paths between worlds.

A birelu seems to both stand upright and walk upon all fours at the same time, its form shifting and flowing incomprehensibly between the two poses. Even while partially hunched in this manner, a birelu stands over 7 feet tall when in its natural state.
