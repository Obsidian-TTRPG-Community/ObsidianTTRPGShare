special_abilities:
  - name: Illusion Sense (Ex)
    desc: Shrike worms can sense illusion magic, rendering it less effective against them. A shrike worm gains a bonus on saving throws against illusion spells and effects equal to its Charisma bonus, and it does not need to examine or interact with an illusion in order to attempt a saving throw to disbelieve it.
  - name: Impale (Ex)
    desc: If a shrike worm begins its turn with a creature grappled with its tentacles, it can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check as a free action to try to impale the grappled creature on one of the spines on its back. If the shrike worm succeeds, the grappled creature takes 6d6+18 points of damage and is pinned. Once a creature is impaled, it loses the grappled condition and the shrike worm can use all of its tentacles without penalty. A shrike worm can have up to six Medium or smaller creatures impaled on its spikes at a time. An impaled creature can remove itself from a spine by succeeding at a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check as normal. A creature that is removed from a shrike worm spine (either by its own efforts, those of its allies, or magic) takes 3d6 points of bleed damage and is sickened for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Impossible Form (Su)
    desc: Any creature within 100 feet of the shrike worm that can see it must succeed at a DC 27 Will saving throw or become fascinated for as long as the creature remains within range of this ability. A creature that fails its save believes the shrike worm is a hallucination or an illusion; the shrike worm’s approach does not constitute an obvious threat and does not break this fascination effect. The fascination effect ends as normal if the shrike worm attacks or interacts with the affected creature or its allies. A creature that saves against a shrike worm’s impossible form aura is immune to it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Phantasmal Slime (Sp)
    desc: As a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, a shrike worm can spew from its mouth a 30-foot cone of scintillating color that infects the minds of those it touches. This functions as per phantasmal web (DC 21), except that a creature that fails its save believes it is caught in threads of sticky, luminous slime infested with diminutive shrike worm larvae. The shrike worm can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature that realizes the slime is illusory gains a +4 bonus on saves to resist subsequent uses of this ability.

## Description
Shrike worms are insidious creatures from the edges of reality, and are able to blur the boundary between what is real and unreal in order to take their prey by surprise. Also known as hallucination worms, they are most often called shrike worms due to the method by which they kill their prey. When a shrike worm catches a creature in its tentacles, it then impales its victim on its iridescent back spines, pinning the creature in place in order to prolong its prey’s suffering as much as possible.

Shrike worms grow to over 25 feet long and, despite weighing upward of 16,000 pounds, carry themselves about with surprising grace on their long legs. This lends their movements an unearthly quality, which is further enhanced by their magical abilities.
