  - name: Disease (Su)
    desc: A shaghal’s bite delivers bubonic plague (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557). If the target fails its saving throw, it contracts the disease immediately; the onset period doesn’t apply.
  - name: Dust Breath (Su)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds, a shaghal can cough forth a 15-foot cone of ash and dust. Any creature that is caught in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or cough uncontrollably for 1d6 rounds. A creature can attempt a new saving throw each round at the beginning of its turn to end its coughing fit. Any creature that spends 2 consecutive rounds coughing takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and is nauseated for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Hunger (Su)
    desc: A shaghal deals an additional 2d6 points of nonlethal damage with each successful bite as it leaves its target wracked with hunger pangs. Creatures that don’t need to eat are immune to this effect.

## Description
Packs of shaghals roam the desolate plains of Abaddon, where they serve various daemons as guard dogs and sentries. Though not as intelligent as an average human, shaghals are cunning creatures that work with one another to chase down prey, and they are smart enough to understand complex orders from their handlers. Shaghals don’t have the ability to speak, but they can understand the languages of fiends. Those who converse with shaghals via telepathy report that the creatures communicate morose and fatalistic messages, and that their only wish is to witness and partake in death and ruin.

On the Material Plane, shaghals often find themselves called to the same desert locations populated by jackals. When shaghals encounter packs of jackals, they intimidate and cow them, bringing the animals under their influence. Shaghals bolster the confidence of these otherwise cowardly beasts, and take over control of their packs in order to lead them to remote villages, protected oases, and even defended settlements to terrorize the humanoid populaces.

With each step, ash and dust fall from shaghals’ coats like dander, and the beasts can cough forth clouds of this grime to incapacitate their enemies. As servitors of daemons, shaghals spread disease, hunger, death, and savagery wherever they go. While they are most plentiful in the wastelands of Abaddon, shaghals may occasionally find themselves on the Material Plane, where they doggedly hunt down mortals. They believe, falsely, that the souls of all the mortals they kill and devour are sent directly to Abaddon.
