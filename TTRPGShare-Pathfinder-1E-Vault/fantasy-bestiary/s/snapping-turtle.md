## Description
Snapping turtles are water-dwelling reptiles known for their propensity to bite anyone they deem threatening. Adult snapping turtles are usually about 1-1/2 feet in diameter. A spellcaster who can acquire a familiar can choose a snapping turtle as a familiar. A snapping turtle familiar grants its master  a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves.
