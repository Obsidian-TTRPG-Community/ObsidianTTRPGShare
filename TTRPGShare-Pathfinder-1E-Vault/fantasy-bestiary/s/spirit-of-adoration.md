special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Charming (Su)
    desc: The spirit’s aura sways the feelings of creatures within 30 feet that have an attitude of unfriendly or worse. Such creatures must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be affected by charm monster for 1 day. Creatures that attack the spirit must save against the aura, regardless of their attitude. A creature that makes its save is immune to the spirit’s aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Bardic Knowledge (Ex)
    desc: The spirit adds half her Hit Dice (+9) on all Knowledge checks and may make all Knowledge checks untrained.
  - name: Bardic Magic
    desc: Each day, the spirit can cast any three bards spells of any level and in any combination. Her caster level for these bard spells is 18th. She may select any spells from the bard spell list when using this ability.
  - name: Bardic Performance (Su)
    desc: The spirit has the bardic performance class ability. She can use bardic performance for 11 rounds per day, and has access to the following abilities: countersong, distraction, fascinate, and inspire courage (+5).
  - name: Inspiration (Su)
    desc: The spirit can choose an intelligent creature to inspire and serve as a muse for by giving that creature some token of her power (typically a lock of her hair or a piece of her garment). As long as the spirit retains her favor for this creature and the creature carries the spirit’s token, the creature gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. A bard who has the spirit for a muse in this way can use his bardic performance for an additional number of rounds per day equal to the spirit’s Charisma bonus. The spirit retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier. The spirit can end this effect at any time as a free action, even if she is not on the same plane as the carrier. The spirit may inspire a number of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma bonus.
  - name: Stunning Bolt (Su)
    desc: The spirit’s stunning bolt is a ray of brilliant divine energy. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. Any creature that it strikes takes 1d8 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. If the target succeeds at this save, it is merely dazzled for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unearthly Grace (Su)
    desc: The spirit adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.

## Description
The Spirit of Adoration is among Shelyn’s greatest servants, an intelligent personification of true love, whose power lifts the heaviest heart and overcomes all obstacles. She rarely comes to the mortal world, and it is even rarer for her to enter battle, but when that time comes, it is said that there is nothing she cannot bend or break in pursuit of her goal.

The spirit’s true form is that of a 10-foot-tall, angel-winged woman-usually a human but sometimes an elf- dressed in flowing clothes and bearing a shining steel glaive. When interacting with easily frightened mortals (especially children), she uses her shapechanging powers to look like a human or elf of normal height, attractive according to the standards of the local people, but she never makes herself so beautiful as to cause jealousy or inspire inappropriate comments or attention.

When not carrying out Shelyn’s will, the spirit enjoys dancing in clouds, across lakes, and on mountaintops, whether on Golarion or Nirvana, ignoring the occasional bolt of lightning that strikes her.
