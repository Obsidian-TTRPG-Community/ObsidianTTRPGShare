special_abilities:
  - name: Bay (Su)
    desc: When the Sandpoint Devil screams as a standard action, all creatures within a 300-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, creatures within the effect are immune to the Sandpoint Devil’s bay for 24 hours thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Hellfire Breath (Su)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds, the Sandpoint Devil can unleash a blast of infernal flame from its mouth as a standard action. This hellfire fills a 30-foot cone and causes 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 half). Anyone who takes damage from this breath weapon must also make a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming cursed by the infernal flames-those who become cursed take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for a number of days equal to the damage taken-during this time, the victim’s skin appears to be horribly burned in places regardless of any healing applied. This curse effect functions at caster level 12th. The save DC for both saves is Constitution-based.
  - name: Kick (Ex)
    desc: The Sandpoint Devil’s hoof attacks are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.

desc_short: This mangy horselike beast walks perversely upright. Wings, a dragon’s tail, and a fanged mouth complete its vile appearance.

## Description
The legendary Sandpoint Devil has haunted the lands around its namesake town on the western Varisian coast for well over a decade. It most commonly appears on misty, moonless nights, sometimes leaving behind strange clues to its passing, such as brimstone-smelling hoofprints in odd places (such as along the eaves of a steep roof ).

A thief of livestock, kidnapper of children, and bringer of woes-countless tales surround the beast. Some explain away the creature as an ancient, wizard-warped beast from a forgotten age. Others hold that the monster was borne by a cursed witch who broke an oath with a devil. Yet perhaps the most disturbing rumors point to the possibility that the creature is but one of many that dwell in the wilds.
