## Description
A sawleg locust is a larger variety of grasshopper that grows as large as 2 feet in length and feeds on a variety of plants. Periods of drought sometimes cause these locusts to gather in large groups, either to migrate to better feeding grounds or rarely to overpower and consume small animals.
