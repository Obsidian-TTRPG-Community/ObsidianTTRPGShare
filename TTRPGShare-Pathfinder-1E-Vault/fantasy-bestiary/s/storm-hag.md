special_abilities:
  - name: Child-Scent (Ex)
    desc: A storm hag has the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoid children and immature animals. Thus, she could sniff out a child’s hiding place or a den of wolf pups, but not the child’s parents or the den mother.
  - name: Storm Rider (Su)
    desc: A storm hag is considered two size categories larger for the purpose of wind effects.
  - name: Storm Strike (Su)
    desc: Each time a storm hag makes a successful attack with her bite, claws, or a weapon that is predominantly made of metal, the attack deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage.
  - name: Whipping Winds (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a storm hag can use gust of wind to trip her foes. This ability can only affect one target within 30 feet, and the storm hag uses her normal CMB. The gust of wind doesn’t create its normal effects. The trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, but casting the spell-like ability does as normal.

## Description
When the clouds turn gray and the winds pick up into a howl, wise travelers pray that the cause is only a natural tempest and not a storm hag. A storm hag resembles an old woman with a thundercloud of hair. Her mouth hangs open, revealing thin pointed teeth with small arcs of electricity jumping across them. Black talons sprout from her fingertips, likewise crackling with electricity. A storm hag weighs 70 pounds and stands around 4 feet tall, though if she stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet.
