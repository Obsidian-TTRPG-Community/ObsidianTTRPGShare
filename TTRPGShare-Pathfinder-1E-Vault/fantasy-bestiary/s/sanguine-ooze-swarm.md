    desc: Sanguine oozes are composed of congealed euphoric toxins. Any living creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm’s viscous ability must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or erupt into uncontrollable laughter and be effectively staggered for that round. This is a mindaffecting effect. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect.
  - name: Viscous (Ex)
    desc: Whenever an alchemical ooze swarm makes a swarm attack on a creature of Small size or larger, that creature must make a DC 13 Reflex save or be covered in patches of sticky ooze globules. Those who fail are entangled until the patches of ooze are removed. The ooze can be removed by spending a full-round action to fling off the globules-though this action might be impeded by the ooze’s effects. If a creature affected by this ability takes any amount of cold damage, the ooze patches are immediately destroyed. The save DC is Constitution-based.

desc_short: Dozens of tiny globs of slime move on their own, acting as one being, alternately clinging to each other and separating in a riot of oozing momentum.

## Description
Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile chemicals. Although composed of unpredictable compounds and toxins, these mobile oozes pose little threat individually, but in polluted quagmires and tainted sewers can collect in numbers great enough to threaten creatures many times their size. Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to compose the bodies of living beings.

Appearing at first to be a collection of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along as a single unit.
