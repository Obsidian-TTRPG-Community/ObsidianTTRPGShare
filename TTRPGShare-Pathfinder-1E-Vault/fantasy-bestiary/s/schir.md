## Description
A schir resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with the head and hooves of a demonic goat. A ragged hide covers patches of a schir’s body, usually around the forearms and lower legs, with a crestlike patch running down from the creature’s crown to the nape of its neck. Schir demons are 7 feet tall, though they usually stoop and so appear shorter, and weigh 300 pounds.

Also known as spite demons, schirs are among the most violent and vile-tempered inhabitants of the Abyss. Schirs are formed from the souls of mortals who either committed or framed others for heinous crimes-acts committed for the sole purpose of petty retribution. Despite such origins, schirs occupy one of the lowest orders in the demonic hierarchy, often serving as front-line infantry in demonic armies or as guards for minor demonic commanders.

Although not especially intelligent, schirs are cunning warriors and able sentries. Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir’s natural jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or any other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs’ capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of any creature that has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times.

A schir set loose upon the Material Plane quickly seeks to set itself up as a leader of its own army-often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids and attempt to replace the current leaders. They are particularly fond of infiltrating gnoll tribes.
