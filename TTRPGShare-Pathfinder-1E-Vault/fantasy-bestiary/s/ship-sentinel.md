## Description
Organization solitary
Treasure noneSpecial AbilitiesSalted Wound (Su) Any living creature damaged by a ship sentinel must make a successful DC 16 Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls for 1 round as salty brine drips painfully onto the wound. On a successful critical hit, the target takes an additional 3d6 points of damage as its flesh cracks and withers from dehydration. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Ship Sight (Su) A ship sentinel is treated as having tremorsense out to 100 feet while onboard a ship, as its senses permeate the vessel’s timbers. It can only detect creatures in contact with the vessel or on objects in contact with the vessel. It cannot use this ability to detect creatures not in contact with the ship, even if they are within the ability’s 100-foot radius.DescriptionShip sentinels are animated constructs that are bound to a specific vessel and to that ship’s captain. Crafted to resemble a humanoid figurehead, a ship sentinel normally rests at the prow of its ship, granting good fortune and protection to the crew. But in times of dire need, the captain can also activate the ship sentinel, causing it to spring to life and fight alongside the vessel’s crew. Although individual features of ship sentinels may vary, all ship sentinels are made of wood and have the same general statistics.

A ship sentinel stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
