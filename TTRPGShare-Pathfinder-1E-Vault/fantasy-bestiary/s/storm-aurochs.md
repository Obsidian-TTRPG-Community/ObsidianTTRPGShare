special_abilities:
  - name: Stampede (Ex)
    desc: A stampede occurs if three or more storm aurochs make a trample attack while remaining adjacent to each other. While stampeding, storm aurochs can trample foes of their size or smaller, and the trample’s save DC increases by 2.
  - name: Storming Charge (Su)
    desc: A storm aurochs steps grow thunderous as it charges toward its enemies. A storm aurochs’ powerful charge deals an additional 3d6 points of electricity damage, and its trample deals an additional 3d6 points of sonic damage, which are already included in the above statistics. If the storm aurochs is outdoors and in a stormy area-one featuring a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)-its powerful charge and trample instead deal 3d10 points of electricity or sonic damage respectively, rather than 3d6 points of damage.

## Description
Stampeding across the sky in booming herds, storm aurochs resemble nothing so much as vast and powerful thunderstorms bearing down across Golarion. Storm and cloud giants value these magnificent beasts not only for their meat and hides, but also as symbols of mystic power and divine strength. Though ostensibly domesticated centuries ago by storm giants, storm aurochs remain among the most fearsome and dangerous of the creatures that pass through Golarion’s skies. A storm aurochs is roughly twice the size of a normal aurochs, growing up to 20 feet long and standing 15 feet tall at the shoulder. Storm aurochs weigh on average anywhere from 5 to 7 tons, with females being noticeably smaller and slimmer than males. Both males and females bear prodigious horns atop their heads that crackle with electrical energy, though the female’s horns are slightly smaller.
