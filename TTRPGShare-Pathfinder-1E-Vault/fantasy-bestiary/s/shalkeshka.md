special_abilities:
  - name: Burrowing Charge (Ex)
    desc: A shalkeshka can use the charge and run actions while burrowing.
  - name: Feeding (Ex)
    desc: As a free action while a shalkeshka is burrowed beneath the ground, it can go into a dormant state and leech nutrients from the soil. During this time, the shalkeshka regains hit points at a rate of 5 hit points per hour. While in this state, the creature can’t move, doesn’t have to eat or drink, and is considered flat-footed for the first full round of combat if interrupted from its dormancy.
  - name: Pit Surge (Ex)
    desc: A shalkeshka can burrow into dirt, sand, or loose soil to lie in ambush 30 feet beneath the surface. It monitors the area above it using tremorsense, awaiting a victim’s movement into the area. When it detects prey, the shalkeshka can surge to the surface as a standard action and make a single bite attack. This action creates a 30-foot-deep pit where the shalkeshka was laying in wait. All creatures standing in the area above must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save to jump to safety in the nearest open space to the edge of the newly formed pit. Creatures that fail this Reflex save fall into the pit, taking damage as normal. The pit’s walls have a climb DC of 25. The shalkeshka (along with any creature it may have grappled) can stay above ground by making a successful saving throw, or voluntarily fall back into the pit. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

desc_short: This creature’s bulbous compound eyes peer in all directions as its twin mandibles twitch and gnash. Six legs, each ending in spade-like claws, support its bulk.

## Description
A dangerous nuisance in northern Garund, a shalkeshka is a strange burrowing predator that inhabits fertile soil near rivers, oases, and (most destructively) farmland. This creature’s anatomy is reminiscent of an insect or some sort of lizard, and when burrowing it tears into the earth with its claws, swimming through sand and soil. Since the creatures spend most of their time buried underground, their pale, nearly transparent skin is cool and clammy to the touch. Shalkeshkas feed on whatever creatures are unfortunate enough to tread the ground above them while they nest in the earth below. When fighting, a shalkeshka viciously grapples its victim with its mandibles, shredding its prey to pieces with its claws.

Squat and powerfully built, a shalkeshka stands only 5 feet tall, but is 8 feet wide and weighs almost 2,500 pounds.
