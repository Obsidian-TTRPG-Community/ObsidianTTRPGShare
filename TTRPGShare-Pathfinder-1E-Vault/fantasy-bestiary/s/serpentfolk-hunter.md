## Description
Trained in tracking and slaying warmblooded humanoids-humans in particular-a serpentfolk hunter is a powerful but blunt instrument of its intelligent, ruthless masters. It’s often in the first wave of warriors sent to secure an area, and might serve as a bodyguard for a powerful serpentfolk priest or mage. In turn, it may well wield power and status over less specialized degenerate serpentfolk. The purecaste serpentfolk allow such hierarchical jostling among their underlings-the equivalent of letting a pack of dogs sort out their own structure-so long as their minions never question the purecastes’ orders and judgments.

 Despite the fact that the serpentfolk live underground, serpentfolk hunters usually train to work against a specific enemy rather than in a specific terrain. This allows them to do their job equally well when defending their cavern-cities against encroaching adventures as when making precise raids into aboveground communities. A single purecaste serpentfolk might have several different hunters working for him that all specialize in different favored enemies to maximize versatility, or he might have an entire squad trained as a unit from birth to fight a particular hated breed of surface-dwelling foe.
