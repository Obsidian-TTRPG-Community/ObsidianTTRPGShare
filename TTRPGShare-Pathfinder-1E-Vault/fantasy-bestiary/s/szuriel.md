special_abilities:
  - name: Corrupted Flames (Su)
    desc: Channeling the fury and sorrow of those devoured within the boundaries of her domain, Szuriel’s touch corrupts the very essence of fire. Any spell-like ability or supernatural effect used by Szuriel that normally causes fire damage deals half of that damage as fire damage and half of it as profane damage that is not subject to energy resistance or fire immunity.
  - name: Eruptive Arrival (Su)
    desc: When Szuriel uses any teleportation effect, she can create a pyroclastic detonation upon arrival as a swift action. This creates a blast of fire that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 41 half). Szuriel can selectively omit creatures from this effect as she chooses, though she rarely does, enjoying the carnage and death of even her own allies. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Fury of the Forsaken (Su)
    desc: As a standard action once per day, Szuriel can instill all non-daemons within a 60-foot radius of herself with a mind-twisting rage and lust for blood. Affected creatures gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a -2 penalty to AC, and they are compelled to attack the nearest creature regardless of any previous allegiances. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 36 Will save; otherwise, it persists as long as Szuriel remains within line of sight. When the effect ends, an affected creature becomes fatigued. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and does not stack with barbarian rage, the rage spell, or similar effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Warmonger (Ex)
    desc: Szuriel is proficient with all weapons, and is treated as a 20th-level fighter for the purpose of qualifying for feats that require a minimum fighter level as a prerequisite.

## Description
At first glance, Szuriel seems a triumphant, angelic figure. With her ivory skin, f lowing golden hair, f lawless and powerful body clothed in a coil of unsullied silk, and wings the blue-black of a raven, she appears as a personification of glory from on high-a veritable goddess of war. Up close, however, this impression quickly fades. Mirrored and black as onyx, Szuriel’s eyes bleed constantly in crimson rivulets that run down her cheeks and fall to the ground. When she deigns to smile, she reveals a mouth of jagged, razor-sharp fangs more befitting a shark or dragon than anything humanoid. Szuriel’s greatsword, Lamentation of the Faithless, has been wielded by every Horseman of War dating back to the first, and it is said to be the corrupted blade of an ancient and forgotten empyreal lord. 

The Horseman of War was once a fallen mortal paladin. After she was excommunicated for her sins, she became a conquering general and finally a ruling empress who slaughtered the followers of her former faith. Her own death came not on the battlefield but by an assassin’s blade, yet this merely opened the greatest chapter in her conquests by propelling her into Abaddon and, in time, the role of the Horseman of War. 

Szuriel makes open mockery of all angels, playing upon their thematic elements in her warped, destructive interactions with mortals, awing both the misguided and those fully cognizant of her nature. Her cults often portray her not as a paragon of destruction, conquest, and genocide, but as promising righteous victory, with the souls of fallen soldiers elevated to paradise regardless of what horrific crimes they commit. 

Szuriel’s armies represent the largest and most strictly organized force in Abaddon, but at any given moment, fully half of the Horseman’s armies are scattered throughout the planes in mercenary service to various Abyssal lords, archdevils, and whatever other forces purchase their services. Most times, that price is steep, as Szuriel demands living mortals or souls, or the right to consume those who fall upon the field of battle. When her armies march upon the mortal plane, they honor their commitments just long enough to make their “allies” complacent before engaging in systematic genocide.
