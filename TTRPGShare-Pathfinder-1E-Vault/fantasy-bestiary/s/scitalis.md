special_abilities:
  - name: Prismatic Pattern (Su)
    desc: Due to the hypnotic and distorting effects of a scitalis’s colorful pattern, creatures that can see the dragon take a penalty on attack rolls against it equal to the dragon’s Charisma modifier (a -2 penalty for a typical scitalis). As a standard action, a scitalis can enhance the pattern, causing all creatures within 60 feet of it that can see it to become stunned for 1d4+1 rounds (Will save DC 23 negates). Prismatic pattern is an illusion (pattern) effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Sedative (Ex)
    desc: A scitalis’s bite and breath weapon introduce a potent sedative into its victims, causing them to become staggered for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution based.

## Description
Scitalises are horned dragons with long, ophidian bodies; beautiful, many-colored frills; and thin, tapered horns. Their heavy scales have an elliptical shape, and grow ragged and thicker as the scitalises age. A scitalis glows from within, its scales and frill lighting up like a stained-glass window and projecting mesmerizing patterns that the dragon uses while hunting.

 Scitalises covet territory and food more than the gold and gems that true dragons prize. They live in caves, forest grottoes, and rocky crags, and mark their territories with a combination of musk and their sour, bile-scented sedative. Scitalises often range up to 5 miles from their nests every few days to hunt large herd animals and livestock. Lacking forelegs with which to tear apart a meal, scitalises allow their kills to ripen for a day or so in their lairs before eating them. They keep some treasure and can be bribed, burying what they do attain in the walls and f loors of their nests.

 Scitalises lay clutches of one to three eggs, and males and females share duties guarding the nest. The pair remains together until the juveniles reach maturity after 2 years. These eggs sell for 5,000 gp in large cities, and juveniles can command prices of 8,000 gp. Scitalises coexist with wyverns, but detest basilisks and griffons, which regularly devour the scitalises’ eggs when they run across them.

 An average scitalis is between 14 and 18 feet long and weighs approximately 2,500 pounds.
