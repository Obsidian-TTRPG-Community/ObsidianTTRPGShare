  - name: Resonant Flight (Su)
    desc: The wings of a scythe glass swarm produces a resonant sound, creating a hypnotic effect to all who hear it. Every creature within 60 feet of a scythe glass swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become fascinated for 2d4 rounds. While the target is fascinated, the scythe glass swarm can approach the target without breaking the effect, but an attack from the scythe glass swarm immediately ends the effect. Creatures that successfully save against this effect can’t be affected by the same scythe glass swarm’s resonant flight ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Serrated Wings (Ex)

## Description
Many would-be thieves have found themselves spellbound by the sound of a beautiful, stained glass window breaking apart and taking flight. This is followed by their screams of terror as thousands of tiny wings cut them to shreds. Scythe glass swarms are used to safeguard shrines and inner sanctums from unwanted attention while also providing beautiful facades when the creatures are inactive. Different religions and sects add their own twists on the constructs to express some aspect of their gods or masters. A scythe glass swarm remains within the confines of the area it is guarding, but even if intruders manage to escape, the blood from pouring from their wounds can be used to track down the interlopers.

Scythe glass swarms consist of thousands of winged glass insects. An individual insect is 9 inches in height and weighs under a pound.
