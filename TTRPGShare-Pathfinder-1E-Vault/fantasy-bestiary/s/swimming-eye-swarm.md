special_abilities:
  - name: Indescribable Swarm (Ex)
    desc: The horror of discovering a swarm that seems normal at first holds a bloodcurdling secret can drive sane folk mad. The first time an intelligent creature encounters a given variety of swarm with this ability, it must succeed at a Will saving throw against the swarm’s distraction ability save DC or become shaken for 1 hour or until the swarm is defeated, whichever comes first.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex; cure 1 save.
  - name: Ruptured Membranes (Ex)
    desc: As a defense mechanism, some members of a swimming eye swarm sacrifice themselves by rupturing their outer membranes when unexpected creatures enter the swarm’s space, splattering the target with gruesome vitreous fluid. Any creature entering a space occupied by a swimming eye swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or be affected by the swarm’s poison ability. A creature that fails its saving throw against poison administered in this way is nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
The darkest depths of the sea are home to some of the strangest creatures imaginable. At first glance, these creatures appear to be little more than small jellyfish. However, at the heart of each gelatinous mass is a disturbingly human-looking eyeball floating as if suspended in the creature’s bodily fluids.

Like many of their common jellyfish cousins, the creatures in a swimming eye swarm are incredibly poisonous. Their uncanny eyeballs act as poison sacs as well as a sensory organ. These eyes are remarkably fragile, often bursting after even the gentlest jostling. However, a swarm’s eyeballs grow back quickly, often in less than a week.
