special_abilities:
  - name: Braincloud (Su)
    desc: Once per round, in place of a melee attack with a tentacle, a shoggti can make a melee touch attack with the pincer on the end of that tentacle. If it hits, the target takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Shoggti use this ability to mentally debilitate their victims so they can more easily use their charm spell-like abilities against them.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    desc: Creatures that succumb to a shoggti’s horrific appearance become fascinated by the creature’s hypnotically wriggling tentacles and the strange, shimmering colors in its eyes. This effect persists for 1d6 rounds (but can be ended by the normal methods of defeating the fascinated condition).

## Description
The shoggti are masters of mind manipulation, capable of seizing control of the thoughts of others and charming them into docile allies. They invade other realms in slaver bands, seeking out creatures to capture alive and return to the Abyss as charmed slaves-the fates of these poor souls is unknown, but likely has something to do with the qlippoth drive to reclaim the Abyss as their own.

Although a shoggti lacks proper hands, it is capable of performing incredibly dextrous manipulations with the pincers at the tips of its tentacles. It cannot wield weapons in these pincers, but it can utilize magic items like wands, rods, staves, and the like. Shoggti are fond of wands in particular, particularly those that create mind-affecting effects that are easy to inflict on victims of their braincloud ability.

A shoggti’s body is an egg-shaped mass about 8 feet long-its tentacles are about 8 feet long as well. The whole creature weighs 900 pounds.
