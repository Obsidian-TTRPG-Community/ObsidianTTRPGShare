special_abilities:
  - name: Freewheeling Charge (Ex)
    desc: A spiroskek can prime its wheel-limb for a swift and powerful charge attack, allowing it to move triple its normal speed on a charge, double move, or run action. While using a freewheeling charge, a spiroskek may run or charge over difficult terrain (though each square of difficult terrain still counts as 2 squares of movement). If the spiroskek successfully hits during this charge, it can immediately attempt either a bull rush or an overrun combat maneuver with a +4 circumstance bonus on the check without provoking an attack of opportunity. The effort needed for a freewheeling charge leaves the spiroskek staggered until the end of its next turn.
  - name: Wheel Barbs (Ex)
    desc: The spiroskek’s wheel-limb is covered in tiny, flexible barbs. These grant the spiroskek a +4 bonus to CMD against bull rush, dragAPG, repositionAPG, and trip maneuvers, and to Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery terrain.

## Description
Wise Darklands-dwellers learn to listen for the faint, eerie “skek-kek-kek” noise that a prowling spiroskek’s wheel-limb makes. These insectile carnivores of Nar-Voth stalk a variety of intelligent prey, and generations of devouring derros, duergar, and fey has imparted the creatures with a measure of illusory magic. They are clever ambush predators, capable of phenomenal bursts of speed. Once their prey has been wounded, a pack follows like vultures, waiting for their anticoagulant saliva to bleed a creature dry before moving in to feast. Many spiroskeks target slaver parties, taking advantage of the meat that arrives bound or hobbled; duergar especially hate the beasts.

Spiroskeks are clever, but have little culture. They communicate in a language of mandible clicks and bodily gestures, which they use to give warnings and exchange tales of successful hunts. Normally loyal to their nests, spiroskeks consider most other creatures-even others of their kind-either enemies or prey.

Spiroskeks are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh approximately 170 pounds.
