## Description
Created through rituals that suffused elemental fire with the dark corruption of shadow, shadowfire creatures were spawned from the evil cult led by Yarrix (see page 103). Cruelly transformed from their true forms by their ancient creators, they flicker between existence and nothingness, reality and oblivion, feeding on pain and flame and the screams of those who dare stand against them.
