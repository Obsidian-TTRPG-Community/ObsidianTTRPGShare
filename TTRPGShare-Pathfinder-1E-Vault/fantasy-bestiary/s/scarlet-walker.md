special_abilities:
  - name: Blood-Draining Gaze (Su)
    desc: All creatures within 20 feet of a scarlet walker are subject to the monster’s eerie blood-draining gaze. Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or thin streams of blood pour from their eyes, flowing through the air and into the eye socket-like pits in the scarlet walker’s face. This does not impact the victim’s vision, but does deal 1 point of Constitution damage and sickens the victim for 1 round from the hideous pain. A creature already suffering from a bleed effect takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw. This is a bleed effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Bloodsense (Su)
    desc: A scarlet walker can sense living creatures with blood in their veins, or undead creatures that feed on blood (such as vampires). This ability functions like blindsight to a range of 60 feet.

## Description
The scarlet walker is an alien entity from some other dimension, often conjured by the wizards of Thassilon to serve as a minion. Scarlet walkers were particularly favored for their adeptness at interrogating prisoners, either via torture, or via the creatures’ uncanny ability to mentally compel both actions and compliance. Once an interrogation was over, the scarlet walker’s master typically commanded the monster to render the victim insane or feebleminded if mere death wasn’t appropriate. 

Scarlet walkers themselves hail from the nightmare realm of Leng, where they walk amid strange, stony deserts and stride through the skies above. No mere predators, scarlet walkers build immense hives of coagulated blood and tissue in nameless mountain valleys, and the flavors of various creatures’ blood is an inexhaustible topic of discussion among their kind.
