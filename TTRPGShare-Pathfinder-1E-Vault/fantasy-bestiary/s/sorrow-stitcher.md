special_abilities:
  - name: Needle (Su)
    desc: As a swift action, a sorrow stitcher may jab at an adjacent foe with a shadowy needle that manifests in its hand as part of this attack. The needle attack functions as a primary natural weapon that resolves as a touch attack. If a sorrow stitcher hits with its needle, the target is affected by the hollow heart curse. As long as at least one creature within 30 feet suffers from this curse, a shadow stitcher gains fast healing 2 and a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. 

Hollow Heart Curse: save Will DC 22; effect The creature loses all emotions except fear and sorrow and finds it difficult to defend itself from attacks by sorrow stitchers. The cursed individual takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, cannot gain any morale bonuses, and cannot be subject to a barbarian’s rage ability or similar effects. A creature affected by the hollow heart curse is considered to be flat-footed against all attacks by sorrow stitchers. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Scissors (Su)
    desc: A sorrow stitcher carries shadowy scissors that it can wield as a masterwork short sword.
  - name: Sorrowful Gaze (Su)
    desc: The shadow stitcher can cause a target within 30 feet to become blinded by tears for 1d6 rounds (Will DC 22 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Descendants of fey exiles, these creatures share their forebears’ curse of a severed connection with the First World. Born with broken spirits and empty hearts, sorrow stitchers seek to spread their misery and despair to all they encounter.

 Craving to experience happiness, sorrow stitchers often gravitate toward cities. They are jealously drawn to festivals where they steal the joy from the hearts of unsuspecting revelers. Armed with shadowy scissors and needles, sorrow stitchers can experience fleeting instants of mirth when they inflict the hollow heart curse on a creature, yet this swell of emotion passes quickly, forcing the fey to seek new victims to curse.

 Pale and slender, often appearing in feminine form, sorrow stitchers could be mistaken for humans if not for the palpable and visible aura of gloom and shadowy sadness that they constantly emit. Shadow stitchers are fond of wearing garishly colorful clothing, but such festive hues do little to gladden them.
