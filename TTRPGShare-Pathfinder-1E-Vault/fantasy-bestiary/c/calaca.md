special_abilities:
  - name: Antique Weapon (Ex)
    desc: Each calaca carries a single antique weapon, typically a pistol. Only the calaca knows how to use its antique weapon properly, and is treated as proficient with it; all other creatures treat the weapon as if it were broken. If the weapon is already broken, then it does not work at all for any creature other than the calaca. If the weapon is a firearm, the calaca carries only a single bullet.
  - name: Bardic Performance
    desc: A calaca has the bardic performance ability of an 11th-level bard, granting it access to the countersong, distraction, dirge of doom, fascinate, inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and suggestion performances.
  - name: Show Stopper (Sp)
    desc: As a standard action, a calaca can destroy its guitar, creating a deafening boom of sound that immediately halts each other creature within 30 feet that fails a DC 19 Will save. Any creature that fails its save is affected as if by mass hold person. Without its guitar, the calaca loses access to its bardic performance special ability. A calaca who returns to the Boneyard for 24 consecutive hours acquires a new guitar to replace the one that it has destroyed. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Calacas are unusual psychopomps in that their purview is not the dead, but the survivors who must carry on in the dead’s absence. A calaca’s purpose is to abate the sorrow of family members and loved ones of the recently departed. It accomplishes this by way of soothing wisdom and its celebration of the deceased’s life through song. Although mortals who know calacas’ true nature may think them simply magnanimous spirits, these psychopomps have a very pragmatic reason for soothing the aggrieved, which is to dissuade any with the know-how or desire from attempting to raise the dead using necromancy or other foul means.

 In order to mingle with mortals without alerting them to its nature, a calaca disguises itself from head to toe in local finery, wearing gloves and colorful masks to hide its true nature. Beneath its facade, a calaca resembles a large skeleton, its bones a somber gray. A typical calaca stands around 6 feet tall and weighs only 40 pounds.
