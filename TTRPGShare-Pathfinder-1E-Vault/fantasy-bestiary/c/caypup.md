  - name: Thunderous Growl (Su)
    desc: Three times per day, a caypup can issue a rumbling growl from its throat that sounds like distant thunder and scares away potential attackers. Creatures within 15 feet of the caypup must succeed at a DC 12 Will save to attack the caypup (as if affected by sanctuary). The caypup can choose to bestow the same effect on an adjacent ally as well. This effect lasts for 3 rounds or until the caypup or its ally attacks (whichever comes first), after which time the caypup must wait at least 1d6 rounds before using this ability again. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Cayhounds-as fickle and determined as their patron god and master, Cayden Cailean-sometimes birth pups on the Material Plane or Elysium. These half-celestial offspring are known to mortals as caypups.

 Like their otherworldly forebears, caypups are driven to perform acts of good and to halt wrongdoing in the lands they roam. Caypups sometimes join adventurers in hopes of reenacting the legendary deeds of Cayden Cailean and his hound, Thunder. A 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a caypup as a familiar.

 After maturing through infancy, caypups reach an adolescent state that they occupy for their entire lives. Resembling juvenile mastiffs with rust-red fur and piercing blue eyes, caypups are 4 feet from nose to tail and weigh about 75 pounds.
