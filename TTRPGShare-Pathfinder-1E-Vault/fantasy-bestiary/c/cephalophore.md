special_abilities:
  - name: Dazing Gaze (Su)
    desc: A cephalophore can make a gaze attack that affects all seeing creatures within a 60-foot radius. These creatures must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures that successfully save are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Dazing Strike (Su)
    desc: A creature struck by the cephalophore’s slam attack must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Those who save are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mindaffecting fear effect, and the save DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Shatter Weapon (Ex)
    desc: When a character strikes a cephalophore with a weapon, the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage (apply its hardness normally). A weapon that takes damage in excess of its hardness gains the broken condition.
  - name: Statue Form (Ex)
    desc: If a cephalophore stands perfectly still, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue. An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the cephalophore is alive. If a cephalophore initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.

## Description
These construct guardians appear to be looming statues of decapitated humanoids, their severed heads held aloft in a gruesome warning or cradled in their hands like a precious prize. To benign passersby, these marble constructs remain inert, their stone gazes producing only an unnerving sense of watchfulness. However, those who attempt to raid or desecrate a cephalophore’s holy site quickly find that the seemingly immovable statue is anything but. Consequently, many adventurers and tomb raiders have come to see cephalophores as good omens, for when one finds a cephalophore, a dangerous and treasure-filled ruin-hopefully still unlooted-is surely not far away.

Each cephalophore was constructed to stand guard over a single location, typically a tomb or temple. The ravages of time do little to diminish the single-minded dedication of these creatures, but the sacred edifices to which they are bound seldom stand so firmly against the ages. Thus, cephalophores are often found amid ruins or deep in the wilderness, standing vigilant guard over a site long forgotten by mortal society. Many cephalophores lie buried beneath sandy dunes, overgrown by unchecked jungle foliage, or entombed within collapsed caverns.

A typical cephalophore stands 10 to 15 feet tall and weighs 4,000 pounds. Cephalophores are made of solid marble, which makes attacking them with standard weaponry inefficient at best.
