  - name: Devastating Strike (Ex)

A creature or object hit by the disintegration beam takes 20d6 points of damage. An affected creature can reduce the damage to 5d6 with a successful DC 26 Fortitude save.

## Description
Catabolignes are the devastating siege engines of the qlippoth, rampaging among demonic fortifications and unmaking everything in their path. The treelike growth on a cataboligne’s back is capable of unleashing a beam of entropic power that turns all it touches to dust, while its mouth drools a terrible flesh-eating poison. Oddly, catabolignes do not seem hostile toward proteans, who will often merrily lead these devastating qlippoth on destructive sprees. 

A cataboligne is 30 feet tall and 40 feet long, and weighs 16 tons.
