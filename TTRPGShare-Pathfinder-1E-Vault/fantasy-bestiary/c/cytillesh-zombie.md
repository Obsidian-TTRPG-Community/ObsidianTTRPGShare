  - name: Cytillesh Symbiosis (Su)
    desc: The cytillesh fungus infesting the host creature’s body acts as the dead flesh’s animating force. It grants the creature a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and a poisonous touch. The  slam of a cytillesh zombie releases spores that subject the creature to a mild dose of cytillesh poison. The creature must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become dazed for 1d3 rounds as it suffers memory loss of the previous moments. Multiple poisoning effects do not stack, but rather only extend the duration.
  - name: Quick Strikes (Ex)
    desc: Whenever a cytillesh zombie takes a full-attack action, it can make one additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus.
