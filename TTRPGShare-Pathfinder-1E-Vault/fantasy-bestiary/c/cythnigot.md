special_abilities:
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    desc: Creatures that succumb to a cythnigot’s horrific appearance become sickened for 1 round-a cythnigot’s horrific appearance only functions to a range of 10 feet. Once a creature makes a saving throw against a particular cythnigot’s horrific appearance, that creature is immune to the horrific appearance of all cythnigots for 24 hours. A spellcaster that has a cythnigot as a familiar is immune to the horrific appearance of all cythnigots, and also gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against any qlippoth’s horrific appearance.
  - name: Spores (Su)
    desc: Any creature bitten by a cythnigot must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or become infested by the creature’s otherworldly spores. These spores cause twitching spikes and hideous pallid growths of hair-like fibers to erupt from the bite wound and to writhe and wrap around the target’s limbs. A creature suffering from these spores is entangled, and can attempt a new DC 11 Fortitude save in later rounds as a standard action to rip the tendrils free and escape the entangled condition. The effects of multiple cythnigot bites on a creature do not stack. Plant creatures take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives within the corpses of small animals. The fungus transforms the host corpse in hideous ways, adding legs or rearranging features-a rat might gain an extra pair of legs and an insectoid visage, while a cat could lose all its legs and fur and gain a snake-like body. The only thing that all cythnigots have in common is a long stalk of fungal material that extends up from the creature’s body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws. A cythnigot without a host body appears as little more than a foul-smelling puffball the size of a human’s fist.

Chaotic evil spellcasters of caster level 7th who have the Improved Familiar feat can gain a cythnigot as a familiar-to do so, the spellcaster must already have a Tiny animal as a familiar. Infusing this familiar with the spores results in a cythnigot that is a loyal, if rather disgusting, minion of the spellcaster.

A cythnigot is about 20 inches long and weighs 10 pounds.
