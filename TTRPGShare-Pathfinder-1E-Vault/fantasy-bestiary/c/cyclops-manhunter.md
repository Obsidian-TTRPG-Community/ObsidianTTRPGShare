## Description
As the cyclopes’ civilization crumbled, the focus of cyclops life shifted from intellectual and spiritual pursuits to base survival, and those who excelled at hunting, gathering, and enduring the harsh world rose to positions of power and prestige over what remained of their people. Though rarely leaders-cyclopes still revere magical acumen over martial power, even in their humbled state-manhunters occupy a position of respect among cyclops tribes, feeding their peoples’ massive appetites with the flesh of beasts and sentient beings alike. Though competent archers, these hunters are rarely content to draw blood from afar, and train for close combat. Taking advantage of their size, they learn to reap foes with the same strength that their ancestors reaped wheat. Most manhunters prefer to use their archery skills only to harry and anger targets into closing with them, or to stop fleeing opponents lest their tender flesh be wasted. Familiar as they are with their tribal lands and always on the move, these towering hunters are often the first cyclopes that outsiders encounter, and just as often the last.

Manhunters also enforce the law in their communities, dispensing scars and capital punishment for crimes-real or imagined-with swift brutality. Without courts or prisons, modern cyclops justice has devolved into scarification, mutilation, and execution for any crimes. The manhunters impose these cyclopean standards of justice on all they encounter, even when well beyond the lands directly under their control, as they believe the wisdom of the cyclopes is absolute.

While humanoids are their favored prey, manhunters delight in tracking all manner of creatures and wearing their skulls, skins, and shiny belongings as trophies. They rarely use stealth, instead openly pursuing their victims over great distances. In a proper hunt, exhaustion is as likely to fell a manhunter’s prey as her axe.
