special_abilities:
  - name: Disrupt Time (Su)
    desc: A chronogeist’s incorporeal body is warped by the ravages of unstable time. As a swift action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, a chronogeist can oscillate its essence rapidly between the current temporal landscape and an infinite number of others, passing through the bodies of all corporeal creatures within a 30-foot radius. Affected creatures take 6d6 points of damage (this damage occurs from rapid aging and cell death and doesn’t have a damage type). A successful DC 26 Will save negates this damage. Any creature who fails the save is also nauseated for 1 round as a result of the disorienting attack. The chronogeist can use this ability three times per day, but not more often than once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Temporal Screech (Su)
    desc: As a standard action three times per day, a chronogeist can unleash an ear-splitting screech that causes the flow of time around it to stutter. Creatures within 30 feet that can hear the screech must attempt a DC 26 Will saving throw. Those that succeed are unaffected, but those that fail superficially age, their muscles and joints locking up and their movement slowing. For the next 3 rounds, affected creatures can move at only half speed, and take a -8 penalty on Strength- and Dexterity-based checks and abilities, including AC, ranged and melee attack and damage rolls, and skill checks. A creature affected by a chronogeist’s temporal screech (whether or not its saving throw was successful) can’t be affected by it again for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Time Rejuvenation (Su)
    desc: Whenever a chronogeist is within 60 feet of a creature that begins to cast a transmutation or necromancy spell that affects the passage of time (including, but not limited to haste, sands of time, slow, temporal stasis, threefold aspect, or time stop), the chronogeist immediately absorbs a portion of the spell’s energy. The spell still functions as normal, but the chronogeist gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 10 times the spell’s level. These temporary hit points are lost first when the chronogeist takes damage and can stack with each other.

## Description
For thousands of years after it became trapped in Crystilan, Xin-Edasseril existed apart from planar space and time. While the city remained safe from intrusion, its residents were unaware that they were trapped within a temporal prison, replaying the same week-long period over and over. The city’s inhabitants never aged, but the souls of those who died couldn’t escape to the Boneyard. Instead, these trapped souls festered within the demiplane, and over the course of centuries transformed into terrifying, incorporeal undead creatures called chronogeists.

 With each week’s reset, the citizens of Crystilan who had perished in the previous incarnation of the city simply vanished from the memories of those who survived, their passage from life to death wiped clean due to the nature of time within the demiplane being constantly reset. Yet sometimes, people would vaguely recall those who had perished in the form of half-remembered dreams, and as the presence of chronogeists slowly grew, theories as to their nature began to spread through the city’s scholars. Some correctly suspected they were tied to a distortion in time, but most believed they were manifestations of dreams or forgotten memories that sought vengeance upon those who had misremembered them. Of course, at the end of every week, with the resetting of time, these theories would all be forgotten.

 Over the years, the number of citizens in Xin-Edasseril slowly decreased while chronogeists continued to manifest. Fortunately for the city’s inhabitants, once a chronogeist was slain, it didn’t return to life with the next week’s reset-instead, this trapped spiritual energy simply got absorbed into the shell surrounding Crystilan.

 This growing spiritual pressure on the demiplane’s borders is yet another factor that led to its recent destabilization when the Sihedron Heroes harvested energy from the demiplane’s shell using the Timeglass.

 Now that time once again flows forward normally, newly dead souls in Crystilan don’t become trapped and are free to enter the Boneyard normally. Yet for the hundreds of souls still trapped in a strange limbo as a chronogeist, only the destruction of Crystilan itself can allow their escape to the afterlife.

 Chronogeists are incorporeal, and their forms typically resemble far more wicked and angry versions of their appearance before undeath. Unhealthy, pale yellow, or orange lights typically permeate chronogeists, though they flash a gamut of bright colors when they harness the unstable time within them to attack those who disturb them. Chronogeists typically wear ghostly vestments of the clothes they wore when they died or clothing that was heavily associated with them in life, such as a priest’s robes or a soldier’s uniform.
