  - name: Arcane Attacks (Su)
    desc: A cyphergull's natural weapons have a +1 bonus to damage and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. For every 5 Hit Dice the cyphergull has, this bonus increases by 1.
  - name: Cypher Synergy (Ex)
    desc: If the master of a cyphergull familiar is a cyphermage, the cyphergull gains the following cypher lore discoveries if its master has them: analyze scroll, bypass symbol, defensive scrollcaster, and glyph finder. Defensive scrollcaster affects spells the cyphergull casts using its devour scroll ability.
  - name: Devour Scroll (Su)
    desc: When a cyphergull eats a scroll (a full-round action), the spells in the scroll are stored in the gull's body. Thereafter, it can cast the spells as though it were a wizard of a level equal to half the cyphergull's Hit Dice casting spells from a scroll. The cyphergull intuitively understands how the spells function and counts as having the requisite ability score for casting the spell. A cyphergull can store a maximum number of spell levels equal to its Hit Dice.
  - name: Natural Thief (Ex)
    desc: If a cyphergull succeeds at an Acrobatics check to move through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity from an enemy, the cyphergull also doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity when performing a steal combat maneuver against that enemy on the same turn.

desc_short: The eyes of this large gull glow eerily blue. Gray feathers cover much of its robust body, and its long, black-tipped wings are marked with enigmatic symbols. The bird’s yellow bill is heavy and hooked, and its webbed feet bear sharp talons.

## Description
The noisy, enigmatic cyphergulls are a common sight in the coastal city of Riddleport, where they often circle above the ancient rune-carved Cyphergate as if they own it. Their appearance and behavior greatly resembles those of their mundane cousins-seagulls-but they are far more intelligent, and their connection to Riddleport’s ancient Thassilonian stone arch grants them many magical abilities.

 A cyphergull is a little over 2 feet long, has a wingspan of up to 5 feet, and weighs 3 pounds.
