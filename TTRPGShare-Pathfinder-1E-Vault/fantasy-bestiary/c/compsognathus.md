## Description
The compsognathus is a small dinosaur that moves in swift, darting motions. Its bite injects a venom that causes numbness and weakness, a trait that the animal uses to bring down larger prey. A compsognathus measures 3 feet long and weighs 15 pounds. 

These dinosaurs can serve spellcasters as a familiar. A compsognathus familiar grants its master a +4 bonus on Initiative checks.
