special_abilities:
  - name: Greater Slaying Arrow (Su)
    desc: Cernunnos can spend 1 minute crafting any kind of greater slaying arrow (DC 32). He can have only one such arrow at a time, and it only functions for him. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horned Lord’s Charge (Ex)

  - name: Lightning Rod (Su)
    desc: Cernunnos absorbs and negates any electricity effect that targets him or includes him in its area. As an immediate action on his next turn, he can release this energy to grant the shock weapon special ability to all weapons wielded by his allies within 30 feet for 1 round.
  - name: Perfect Archer (Ex)
    desc: Cernunnos does not provoke attacks of opportunity for firing bow weapons in melee. He threatens squares out to his normal reach when wielding a bow. He automatically creates arrows when firing a bow and treats any bow he wields as if it had a range increment of 500 feet.

    desc: Any summoned animal or creature summoned by summon nature’s ally gains a +4 enhancement bonus to its Strength and Constitution while within Cernunnos’s aura.

## Description
Cernunnos is a powerful empyreal lord who embodies the primeval force of nature as well as its wildness. He surrounds himself with counselors and advisors from all of the celestial races. Although he rarely makes a rash decision, he occasionally lets anger overwhelm his better judgment, even going so far as to swear personal vendettas against specific demon lords or archdevils. A peerless archer and hunter, in such moments of vengeance Cernunnos is tempted to visit Hell or the Abyss to personally exact his revenge.

His preference for decisive action against enemies puts Cernunnos at odds with Korada. Though Cernunnos agrees that even the wickedest souls can seek redemption, he worries that lives would be lost in the time it would take to allow a fiend to seek enlightenment.

The Horned Lord appears as a tall and muscular humanoid with elven features, tan skin, and a pair of antlers growing from his brow. Cernunnos dresses in simple clothes and leathers, died in natural colors but typically woven or worked with motifs of birds in flight or leaping animals.

On Elysium, Cernunnos dwells in an expansive palace constructed of interwoven trees and capped with lush foliage. Known as Briarbough, this sprawling complex of gardens and pools is his seat of power and a place of healing where celestials and good mortals come to have their most grievous wounds tended. Beyond lies hundreds of miles of pristine forest and plains; animals killed here are reborn the next day, fully healed. In times of war, Briarbough serves as a headquarters and hospital for good outsiders.

When not in Elysium, Cernunnos works with other celestial races to stem the spread of evil throughout the cosmos. Recognizing that-despite his power-he is still only one person, the Horned Lord uses his abilities to strengthen and bolster those already allied against darkness, training marshals and emissaries to work as his agents in the mortal and fey worlds. He favors druids and rangers-archers in particular-among his devotees.

In combat, Cernunnos uses stealth and range to draw enemies to terrain of his choosing. The Empyreal Lord then uses his magic to further shape the battlefield to hamper his foes before closing for melee.
