special_abilities:
  - name: False Curse (Su)
    desc: Once per day, a cat sith can fool a creature into believing it has been cursed by the cat sith’s black magic. The target must be within 60 feet and must be able to see the cat sith to be affected by the false curse (Will DC 15 negates). An affected creature takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks, as if affected by bestow curse. Because this effect is not a true curse, the target gains a new saving throw to end the effect at the beginning of each day. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect that can be affected by remove curse. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: No Luck (Su)
    desc: A creature hit by a cat sith’s claws must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be stricken with lucklessness. For 1d4 rounds, the affected creature can’t benefit from any luck bonuses. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Cat siths are inscrutable feline creatures that inhabit highlands around towns and cities. They resemble common housecats at a glance, but cat siths are supernatural beings that have the cunning of civilized races and strange magical powers rivaling those of fey. They’re capable of easily walking balanced on just their hind legs and wearing magic boots. They can carry one object in their front paws when walking bipedally, though they can’t manipulate such objects with the fine control required to use weapons, wands, and similar objects.

Unpredictable yet sophisticated, these strange beings use their unassuming appearances to infiltrate civilized areas, either serving as spies for powerful spellcasters or entertaining their own unknowable agendas.

Many cultures fear cat siths and tell myths about their otherworldly powers. Some say that letting a cat sith near an unburied corpse may allow the beast to steal the departed’s soul before it has made it to the Great Beyond.

A 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a cat sith as a familiar. Cat siths are heavier than most housecats, weighing between 25 and 30 pounds. A cat sith is nearly 2 feet long from its nose to the base of its tail.
