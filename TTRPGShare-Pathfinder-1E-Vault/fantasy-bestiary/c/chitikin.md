    desc: As a standard action, a chitikin can rub its antennae together to emit a terrifying scream. Each creature within 50 feet must succeed at a DC 12 Will saving throw or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Whether or not it succeeds at its save, the creature is immune to the chitikin’s shriek for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting, fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Stalking the edges of civilization, this chitinous predator uses a unique strategy to attract prey: it mimics the screams of its intended victims. When a curious or valorous creature investigates, the chitikin erupts in ambush, amplifying its shriek to terrify its meal. Villagers near the Verduran Forest and World’s Edge Mountains have countless stories revolving around a lonely traveler who hears someone screaming in pain, either in a cave or otherwise off the beaten path, only to investigate and find this horror waiting for him.

 At a glance, a chitikin might be mistaken for a giant black centipede, with its 15-foot body resting on 18 spindly legs. But unlike its smaller, simpler cousins, a chitikin also has a stinger dripping with venom and two large scythe-like claws. Above its hinged jaw are two glowing bulbs on constantly flicking antennae.

 A full-grown adult chitikin is 15 feet long and weighs 2,000 pounds.
