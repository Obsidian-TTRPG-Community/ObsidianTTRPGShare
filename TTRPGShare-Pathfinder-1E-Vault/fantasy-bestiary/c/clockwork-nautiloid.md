## Description
Clockwork nautiloids are specialized, watertight clockwork creations designed to withstand the darkest, coldest ocean depths. A clockwork nautiloid resembles an oversized nautilus with a curved and magically strengthened shell. Its sharp, octopus-like beak is surrounded by dozens of tentacles that appear organic but contain rotors and pistons allowing for a strong, prehensile grip. Most of its tentacles end in a subtly serrated gripping pad, but two of them end in specialized sensory equipment shielded with durable crystal. These clusters provide the clockwork nautiloid with superior senses, allowing it to see even in the oppressive blackness of the deep ocean.

 Clockwork nautiloids pursue the directives of their creators with single-minded purpose, attacking any creature that interferes with their orders. Although a clockwork nautiloid has many gripping tentacles, it can usually bring only four of these tentacles to bear in combat along with its snapping bite. Clockwork nautiloids are relentless combatants that pursue their opponents to any depth and even onto land, propelling themselves with their powerful tentacles.

 A clockwork nautiloid is 30 feet long and weighs 4 tons.
