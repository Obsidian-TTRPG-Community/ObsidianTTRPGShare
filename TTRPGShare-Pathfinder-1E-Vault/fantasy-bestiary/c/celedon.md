special_abilities:
  - name: Granted Power
    desc: A celedon enjoys the favor of the deity who created her. Every celedon chooses one of her deity’s domains and gains that domain’s first granted power. Alternatively, she can choose the prophet’s touch ability below. A celedon only chooses this power once and can never change her granted power.

Prophet’s Touch (Su): Three times per day, a celedon can make a melee touch attack that, on a hit, forces the target to succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or become stunned for 1 round. A creature that succeeds is staggered for 1 round instead. Whether or not the target succeeds, any spells or effects that detect alignment read the target as being the same alignment as the celedon’s deity for as long as they are stunned or staggered. This save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Song of the Gods (Su)
    desc: A celedon has the bardic performance ability of a 3rd-level bard, granting her access to the countersong, fascinate, inspire courage, and inspire competence performances. Rather than Perform, a celedon uses Knowledge (religion) when necessary (such as to determine the saving throw result for countersong). She can make use of this ability a number of times per day equal to 4 + her Wisdom modifier and can employ either her voice or any musical instrument.

## Description
Not all deities trust their worship to the care of fickle, short-lived mortals. When it comes to their most sacred sites, many gods entrust the duty of caretaker to celedons, immortal automatons of perfect faith.

Forged of the purest extraplanar metals, every celedon exists to serve a single deity. Each possesses a boundless willingness to praise their deity’s name, whether through song, oration, mock battle, or whatever performance their creator favors. Most spend the entirety of their existences tending a single holy place, repeating rituals, perfecting services, and creating new works to laud their particular deities. Celedons in the service of a goddess of law might perform an endless cycle of daily ceremonies and shrine upkeep, with time set aside for copying scripture and adjudicating disputes between the faithful. Those who serve a chaotic god of destruction might perform sacrifices as whims strike them, while erratically preparing weapons of war. While only those celedons created by martially minded deities function as warriors, most of these divine constructs zealously defend their divinely chosen homes and eagerly sacrifice themselves in their defense.

Celedons always honor and work to serve the word of their patron deity, nimbly navigating contradictions or hypocrisy in divine dogma. However, if an individual can, through extreme circumstances, convince a celedon to abandon her faith, the results are dramatic. A faithless celedon emits a blast of energy that deals 4d6 points of damage to all creatures within 10 feet, after which her sentience leaves her. The celedon continues to exist and mindlessly performs maintenance routines and other simple duties, but her Intelligence score and all special abilities are lost forever-a fate most celedons consider more merciful than living with apostasy. Revelations capable of causing a celedon to lose faith are exceedingly rare, usually due to exceptional circumstances or adventures-a celedon can’t be persuaded to abandon her faith through mere rhetorical skill.

Most celedons look like idealized humanoids, though their metallic appearances conform to the preferences of their creators.
