    desc: A clockwork songbird’s intricate mechanical voice box allows it to sing a number of songs, each of which provides a distinct effect. Starting a song is a standard action, and it can be maintained each round as a free action; stopping a song is a standard action. A clockwork songbird’s song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the clockwork songbird cannot take a free action to maintain it. A clockwork songbird can sing only one song at a time.

 Airy Aria: The clockwork songbird can whistle a lilting melody that causes allies to feel light on their feet. As long as the clockwork songbird maintains its airy aria, each ally within 60 feet that can hear it gains a +10-foot bonus to its base speed or a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves (recipient’s choice). These benefits do not stack with those provided by the airy arias of other clockwork songbirds.

 Gentle Lullaby: The gentle, crooning lullaby of a clockwork songbird can cause enemies to drift toward slumber. Each round that a clockwork songbird sings its gentle lullaby, each foe within 30 feet that can hear it must attempt a DC 11 Will save. If the creature fails the save, it becomes drowsy; while drowsy, the creature takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity. If the creature is already drowsy and fails the DC 11 Will save, the creature falls asleep and gains the helpless condition. Slapping or wounding the affected creature fully awakens it, but normal noise does not. Alternatively, an ally can fully awaken a creature that is drowsy or fully asleep due to a gentle lullaby as a standard action. A creature that becomes fully asleep due to the gentle lullaby cannot be affected by gentle lullaby for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

 Inspiring Anthem: The clockwork songbird sings a hopeful song that, though somewhat piping and thin, rings true across the battlefield and instills a sense of duty in the hearts of the songbird’s allies. As long as the clockwork songbird maintains its inspiring anthem, allies within 60 feet that can hear it gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls.

## Description
Marvels of machinery and musicality, clockwork songbirds are prized for the beautiful melodies they produce, which can vary based on the songbird’s construction. These clockwork creatures often inhabit the homes and gardens of nobility, where they fill opulent manors and wide-open green spaces alike with their lilting songs. Both children and adults delight in clockwork songbirds, with the former seeing these mechanical creatures as amusing toys and the latter as party novelties.

 A clockwork songbird is typically no longer than 18 inches and weighs about 5 pounds.
