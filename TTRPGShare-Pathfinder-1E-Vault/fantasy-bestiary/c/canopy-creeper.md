special_abilities:
  - name: Aerial Attack (Ex)
    desc: A canopy creeper gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls when battling a creature that is not touching the ground or otherwise braced on a solid surface (such as a ship’s deck). This bonus applies on combat maneuver checks and to CMD.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    desc: Because a canopy creeper blends in with the foliage that is its natural habitat, a DC 20 Perception check (modified for distance) is required to notice it before it attacks for the first time. Any creature with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either of those skills (also modified for distance) instead of Perception to notice the plant.
  - name: Feed (Ex)
    desc: When a canopy creeper grapples a creature with its tendrils, it begins to drain the creature’s bodily fluids through the target’s pores or other body orifices with its tendrils. This feeding deals 1d8 points of damage and 1 point of Strength damage to the target. If the vine tendril is severed or the target breaks the grapple, this feeding ceases until a new grapple is established.
  - name: Vine Tendrils (Ex)
    desc: A canopy creeper can take control of any network of vines it has attached itself to and use up to four of those vines as weapons to strike out at targets up to 100 feet away. The vine tendrils have 10 hit points, DR 5/slashing, and a Break DC of 21. If one of these vines is destroyed, the canopy creeper can assume control of another vine as a move action to bring it to bear in combat.

desc_short: What at first appeared to be nothing more than a tangle of thick, twisted vines growing among the canopy of the trees suddenly coils itself into a large mass dangling high above. A large beaklike maw emerges from the center of the fecund mass, numerous thick, grasping vines whipping through the air.

## Description
A little-known menace of the jungles and forests of uncharted southern Garund, the canopy creeper is a semisentient plant that blends in with the foliage of the forest canopy and makes use of the f lora’s own outgrowth to trap and feed upon its prey. The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly knotted and twisted jungle vines that correspond to the colors and varieties of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beaklike maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed.

The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and food sources are available.
