    desc: A Chelish hell-bred dog gains a +8 racial bonus on Fortitude saves to avoid nonlethal damage from very hot environmental conditions.
  - name: Sulfurous Spittle (Ex)
    desc: Once per hour as a standard action, a Chelish hell-bred dog can spray a 10-foot cone of sulfurous liquid from its mouth. Any creature caught in the cone is nauseated for 1 round and then sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 13 Fortitude save negates the nauseated effect and reduces the sickened effect to 1 round. A creature cannot use the scent ability as long as the sulfurous spray affects it. The save DC is Constitution-based.
