## Description
Climbing ivy thrives in dense forests and urban landscapes, where it can easily relocate to maximize its exposure to the sun. Surprisingly fast for a plant, creeper ivy is territorial and lashes out at creatures that threaten or shade it. It also scavenges when the opportunity presents itself, sometimes drawing nutrition from carrion or even unguarded eggs.
