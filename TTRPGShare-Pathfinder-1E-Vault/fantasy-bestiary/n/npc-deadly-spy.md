    desc: The rogue understands that fighting and killing raises too many questions, and thus uses Diplomacy and Bluff to avoid combat and maintain his cover if at all possible.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The rogue prefers to use sneak attacks and disarm combat maneuvers against his opponents, and flees if he can get away safely. If any who are present can identify him as a spy-or if their continued existence is against the interests of his shadowy paymasters-he strikes to kill.
