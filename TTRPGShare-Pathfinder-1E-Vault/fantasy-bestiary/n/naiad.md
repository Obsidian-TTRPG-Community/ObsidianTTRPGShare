special_abilities:
  - name: Inspiration (Su)
    desc: A naiad can choose another intelligent creature to inspire by giving that creature a token (typically a lock of her hair). As long as the creature carries the naiad’s token and retains her favor, that creature gains a +1 insight bonus on Will saving throws and Craft and Perform checks. The naiad retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier. The naiad can end this effect at any time as a free action. A single naiad can only inspire one other creature at a time in this manner.
  - name: Water Bond (Su)
    desc: A naiad gains strength from a pond, lake, river, or other body of fresh water by bonding with it. While within 300 yards of her bonded body of water, she gains a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class and a +1 racial bonus on saving throws (these bonuses are not included in the stats above). Once per day as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a naiad can forge a bond with a body of freshwater.

## Description
Naiads are protectors of freshwater areas such as lakes, ponds, and particularly rivers. While many naiads are reclusive, some choose to regularly visit settlements built near their bodies of water as long as those settlements are respectful to nature and the fey. Others explore the vast world, bonding to bodies of water as they travel. These naiads are the most likely to come in contact with other societies or visit other nations, but regardless, these fey enjoy inspiring others to artistic greatness. Some take this as proof that naiads originated long ago from the intermingling of nymph and mortal bloodlines.
