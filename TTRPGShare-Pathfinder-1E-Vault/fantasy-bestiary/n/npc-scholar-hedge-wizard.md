## Description
A hedge wizard is a local dabbler in magic, sometimes a hermit or recluse wanting only privacy, but often a local loremaster or apothecary whose studies include both the natural and the supernatural.

Hedge wizards can serve as alchemists, sages, and scholars, or operate a curiosity shop or trading post dealing in magical and mundane items.

A hedge wizard might apprentice with a conjurist or hermit (CR 7) or partner with a medium as mystical advisors to a mayor (CR 9). Two cultists might be found working with a hedge wizard (CR 6), or a hedge wizard may work with a pilgrim and two acolytes to administer to a remote village (CR 6).
