## Description
Bandit lords are the daring masterminds of entire gangs of bandits, often ruling over camps in the centers of trackless woods or the equally trackless warrens of a slum or sewer inside a great city. Some hide their identity behind disguises or a nom de guerre, while others strive for fame or infamy. Bandit lords can be used as assassins, duelists, or royal swordmasters. Bandit lords may have a pair of sellswords as bodyguards and sparring partners (CR 12), or may travel with a battle mage, sellsword, and a gang of eight bandits (CR 12).
