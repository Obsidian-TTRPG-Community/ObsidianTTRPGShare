## Description
Shieldmarshals uphold the law in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar. Chief among their duties is preserving the secrets behind Alkenstar’s most advanced weapons. Their badges, an emblem of crossed rif les, grant them the authority to enter nearly any building in Alkenstar in the course of their investigations.
