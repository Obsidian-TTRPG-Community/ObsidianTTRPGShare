tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The barbarian uses his warhorse for transportation, but if expecting combat, he retrieves an animal from his bag of tricks and rides it instead.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The barbarian charges whenever possible, whether mounted or on foot, using Mounted Combat and his +1 arrow catching buckler to divert attacks made against his mount. If his mount is slain, he draws a replacement from his bag of tricks and makes a fast mount. He uses guarded stance and rolling dodge as needed, often using them or renewed vigor after a ride-by charge while circling around into position for another charge.
