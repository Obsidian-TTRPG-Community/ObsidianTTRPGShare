## Description
Conjurists are arcanists who have studied the planes, irresistibly drawn to forbidden lore that shatters mind and morality. Conjurists may be exotic court mages or unusual war wizards. A conjurist will often keep a battle monk bodyguard or may have a hedge wizard or medium as an assistant (CR 7).
