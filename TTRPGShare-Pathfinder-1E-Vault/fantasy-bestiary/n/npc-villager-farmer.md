## Description
Farmers are the backbone of any economy, producing the foodstuffs and livestock for the world. A typical farmer is fair-minded, sensible, and trustworthy, but suspicious of outsiders. A farmer can be a good source of local gossip, and knows the area around his farm like the back of his hand.

Farmers in particularly dangerous areas might have a shabby suit of leather armor to don in times of trouble (AC 12), and often have an old spear or crossbow somewhere in the house, left over from militia training. A retired veteran farmer, or one who has had to defend his lands too many times from the creatures of the wilds, could have a level of warrior instead of commoner. Such a farmer has the same skills, but his hit points increase to 11, his Fortitude saves to +3, and his Base Attack Bonus to +1. He also normally has a suit of light armor and better weapons he can use to protect his house and family.

Farmers are usually found in families of two to six (CR 1 to 4). Outside, a farmer might be found working with his three stout farmer sons in the fields (CR 3). In town, a farmer could be haggling with a shopkeep (CR 2), or three farmers may be conversing with a lovely barmaid at the local tavern (CR 3). A dozen farmers outfitted with torches and pitchforks (treat as spears) creates an angry peasant mob (CR 6).
