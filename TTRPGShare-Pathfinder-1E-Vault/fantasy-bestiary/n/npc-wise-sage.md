## Description
A wise sage’s cantankerous manner evaporates when she’s expounding on matters of scholarly minutia. The sage’s breadth of general knowledge allows her to speak on most topics, and her precious magic items let her gain enough clues to direct her further research. If she reaches her limit on a topic, she may refer the questioner to a specialist in that field-or she may not, in order to preserve her pride.
