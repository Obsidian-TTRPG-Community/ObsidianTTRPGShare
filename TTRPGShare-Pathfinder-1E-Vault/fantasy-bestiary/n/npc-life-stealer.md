tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The barbarian uses stealth and deception to get close to enemies without them noticing, and uses his chime of opening to break into locked strongholds.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The barbarian tries to disarm opponents at the beginning of combat, using poison against a target’s weakest ability score if he knows his target in advance. He triggers his mighty swing on a sword critical that might slay his target, and uses his rage-enhanced senses to find creatures trying to hide or flee. He uses his buckler when faced with many foes, but against lone targets uses his nine lives stealer for two-handed Power Attacks.
