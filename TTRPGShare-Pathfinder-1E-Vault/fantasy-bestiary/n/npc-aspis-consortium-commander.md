special_abilities:
  - name: Ambush Trap (Ex)
    desc: The Aspis Consortium commander can specially rig a mechanical trap he has either crafted or bypassed by exceeding its Disable Device DC by 10. This trap can then be triggered by the Aspis Consortium commander as a move action as long as he is adjacent to the trap. He adds his trap sense bonus (+5) to the trap’s Perception DC and the trap’s attack rolls, and adds his sneak attack damage (+6d6) to the trap’s damage if the target is flat-footed or otherwise denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.
  - name: Mask Alignment (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, the Aspis Consortium commander can alter his alignment aura to deceive effects that detect alignment. He may choose to be detected as any specific alignment of his choice or as no alignment. This affects only alignment detection, not effects that cause harm or that are otherwise based on alignment. This effect lasts until the Aspis Consortium commander dismisses it or until he changes his alignment aura again.
  - name: Shrunken Smuggle (Sp)
    desc: The Aspis Consortium commander can use shrink item once per day as a 4th-level caster. While an item is shrunk in this way, it is also affected as nondetection. This effect ends when the item returns to its proper size.

## Description
These agents of the Aspis Consortium typically hold silver rank within that organization. Many coordinate field operations for the Aspis Consortium, managing lower-level minions such as bronze agents and mercenaries. Some, however, act as regional overseers instead, guiding a network of small, local Aspis contingents. Aspis Consortium commanders exercise considerable autonomy in the execution of their tasks, but by the same token, they bear the brunt of the responsibility for their subordinates’ failures.
