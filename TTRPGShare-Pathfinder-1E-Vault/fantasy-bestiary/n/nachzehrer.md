special_abilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    desc: A nachzehrer can suck blood from a pinned opponent. If the nachzehrer establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage to its victim. The nachzehrer heals 10 hit points or gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
  - name: Bound to the Grave (Su)
    desc: Nachzehrers are susceptible to certain rituals meant to keep them bound to their graves. Forcing a single coin into the mouth of a helpless nachzehrer (a full-round action) instantly incapacitates it. However, the nachzehrer is no longer incapacitated and can act as normal if this coin is removed, unless its head is also severed from its body (with the coin still in its mouth) and anointed with holy water, and both its body and head are buried at least 6 feet underground.
  - name: Call the Fallen (Su)
    desc: Once per day as a standard action while within any forest, the nachzehrer can harness the energies of the fey and humanoid creatures that have died nearby. This effectively causes 1d4 human juju zombies to rise from the earth in random places in a 30-foot radius around the nachzehrer. These juju zombies don’t provoke attacks of opportunity when they rise in this way, are under the nachzehrer’s control, and act on its turn. Juju zombies can’t rise in this way from any surface that isn’t natural soil (such as the floor of a structure or an area paved with natural rock or stone). Juju zombies the nachzehrer creates using this ability meld back into the earth after 24 hours and are permanently destroyed.
  - name: Fey Disguise (Su)
    desc: While in any forest, a nachzehrer can take on the illusory appearance of any Small or Medium fey creature. This does not affect the nachzehrer’s statistics or give it any special abilities. A nachzehrer so disguised exposes its true nature through subtle mannerisms or flaws in its appearance, and anyone who interacts with the glamered nachzehrer can see through its disguise with a successful DC 25 Perception or Sense Motive check or a DC 24 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horrifying Vision (Su)
    desc: A nachzehrer can channel the foul energy of the terrible fate that befell it into its slam attack. Creatures damaged by its slam attack are panicked for 1 round as their minds are assaulted with the terrible trauma the nachzehrer endured, but the target can reduce this effect to shaken with a successful DC 24 Will saving throw. A nachzehrer can choose not to inflict its horrifying vision on a creature it attacks. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The saving throw is Charisma-based.

desc_short: This spindly-limbed horror has pale eyes, bony fingers that end in dirty claws, papery skin, and long, sharp fangs protruding from a breathless mouth.

## Description
The inspiration of much fear and dread among forest-dwellers, nachzehrers are better known as fey vampires in the woodland regions where they typically dwell. Human locals often confuse them for true vampires, though in reality nachzehrers are a form of monstrous cousin to those hated undead. They rise from the fey victims of virulent disease; the more evil a pestilence’s origin, such as from an Abyssal blight, the more likely fey who succumb are to return as nachzehrers. Unlike true vampires, nachzehrers cannot create spawn, though their aggressiveness toward and hatred of the living is just as intense as those fabled horrors.

 Tragically, nachzehrers typically rise from good or neutral fey, such as dryads, huldras, nymphs, and nereids. Their appearances are sick parodies of the forms they took in life. Their graceful limbs become spindly and bony, their skin becomes thin and papery, and their delicate teeth sharpen into wicked fangs. Nachzehrers are typically 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 100 pounds.
