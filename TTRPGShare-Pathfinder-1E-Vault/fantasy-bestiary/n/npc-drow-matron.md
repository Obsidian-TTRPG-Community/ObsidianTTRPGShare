## Description
Among the demon-worshiping dark elves of Sekamina, the drow matrons are some of the most dangerous. Not only do they hold considerable influence within their matriarchal society, but they must be capable of wicked cunning, incredible treachery, and vile deeds to have attained their august rank as leaders of their chaotic and conniving kind.
