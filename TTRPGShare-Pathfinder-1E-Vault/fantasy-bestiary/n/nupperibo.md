  - name: Infernal Slave (Ex)
    desc: Nupperibos are devils, yet they are essentially mindless shells of solidified torment. Like golems, they have no real minds of their own, but rather follow orders and programming instilled within them by more powerful devils. In the case of multiple orders, only the orders of the most powerful devil are followed. They can utilize simple weapons if commanded, attacking with proficiency, and can also manipulate simple objects like doors. Armor, more complex weapons, and complex tools are beyond their ability to comprehend.

## Description
These mindless drones rank even lower than lemures and serve as little more than mindless sword fodder for their betters. The devils are almost like constructs in their mindlessness, and cannot be communicated with-they raise their spears and attack any non-devil on sight.
