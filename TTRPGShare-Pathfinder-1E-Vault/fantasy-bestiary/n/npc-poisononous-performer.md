tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The monk conceals her shuriken as the metal cymbals inside her tambourine, applying 2 doses of black adder venom or drow poison to the weapons before combat. She performs, bluffs, or connives her way to her target.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: If the monk finds herself outnumbered, she uses flurry of blows with her poisoned shuriken. She shifts and feints through a melee. If her feint is successful, she trips that foe. Once the foe is on the ground, she slams down with a Stunning Fist. A poisonous performer does not hesitate to abandon combat if outmatched or seriously injured, drinking her potion of invisibility and fleeing the field to a place where she can drink a potion of disguise self, blend in, and disappear.

## Description
The poisonous performer is a member of a monastery that seeks enlightenment in the perfection of murder and assassination. Such monks are poison users and masters of disguise, and often greatly feared in the lands around their monasteries. They are sometimes hunted by monks from other monasteries who believe their grim rites are a perversion of proper monastic practices.
