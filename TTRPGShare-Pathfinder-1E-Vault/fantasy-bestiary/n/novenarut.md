special_abilities:
  - name: Parry (Ex)
    desc: As long as a novenarut carries its katana’s scabbard in one hand, it can attempt to parry one melee attack as an immediate action. When it attempts to parry, it makes an attack roll at its highest bonus as if with its katana (+12 for a typical novenarut); if the result is equal to or higher than the attacker’s attack roll, the novenarut parries the blow and takes no damage from the attack.
  - name: Smite Dishonorable Foe (Su)
    desc: Once per day as a swift action, a novenarut can smite one creature that has acted dishonorably within the previous round by dealing sneak attack damage on the novenarut or on one of its allies within 30 feet, by using the dirty trick combat maneuver, or by attacking a helpless foe within 30 feet of the novenarut (at the GM’s discretion, similar acts can qualify as dishonorable actions as well). When the novenarut smites, it adds its Charisma bonus (+2 for the typical novenarut) as a bonus on attack rolls and its HD (6 for the typical novenarut) as a bonus on damage rolls against the dishonorable foe. Once activated, this ability persists until the target is defeated or 24 hours have passed (whichever comes first).

## Description
Dutiful and resolute, novenaruts serve the purpose of officiating honorable duels and structured combat. These inevitables resemble samurai in armor fashioned of plates of jade and steel that cover whirring metallic gears. Novenaruts have six compound green eyes, each of which consists of three green lenses that grant it an enhanced field of vision.

 Typically, a novenarut does not concern itself with day-today battles of honor, focusing instead on conflicts or duels that have higher stakes, such as an honorable battle that determines the fate of a kingdom.
