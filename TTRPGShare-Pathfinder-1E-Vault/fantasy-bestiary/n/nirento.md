    desc: Once per day as a standard action, a nirento can sway and dance in such a way that it attracts any who see the tree within a 60-foot radius. Any creatures other than nirentos in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become entranced by the nirento’s graceful movements, thereafter believing the nirento to be a perfectly normal tree. Affected creatures become passive for 1d6 minutes and refuse to attack the nirento during this time. Affected creatures can attempt a new Will save each round that the nirento attacks an ally-if a hypnotized creature is attacked by the nirento, it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through the hypnotic display. This is a mindaffecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Nirentos are predatory plants with brutish intelligence, their thorny vines able to tear foes limb from limb. A nirento lures prey toward it by swaying its branches and vines in a visually stimulating dance, striking at victims mercilessly once they are within range of its natural weapons. Slain prey then piles up around the tree’s base and is absorbed through its roots. Nirentos’ spongy bodies ensure they absorb most physical blows, though they remain susceptible to slashes and cuts, and when so injured, a translucent green sap oozes from their wounds.

Elder nirentos are individuals that have lived for well over a century, and have absorbed nutrients from countless victims over the years. A typical nirento is 15 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds, while elder nirentos can reach heights of up to 25 feet and weigh over a ton.
