special_abilities:
  - name: Expert Climber (Ex)
    desc: A morlock swarmer troop can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has hand- and footholds. In effect, the troop is treated as constantly being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb, save that it cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the +8 racial bonus on Climb checks normally afforded creatures that have a climb speed.
  - name: Leap Attack (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a morlock swarmer troop that succeeds at an Acrobatics check can move as per the results of that check, making either a long jump or a high jump as normal. The troop must move horizontally in a straight line during its jump. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When using this ability, the morlock swarmer troop can deal troop damage to any creature it is adjacent to over the course of the jump. This does not allow the morlock swarmer troop to deal troop damage to a creature more than once per round.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    desc: Much of the morlock swarmer troop’s damage comes from sneak attacks made by its constituent members as they climb over one another, confusing their prey. Against creatures that cannot be flanked or that are immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, or precision-based damage, the morlock swarmer troop’s attack damage is reduced to 2d6.

## Description
While all morlocks are adept at fighting as a group and swarming against enemies, Kosseruk’s training has whipped these morlocks into a cohesive troop, making them particularly deadly. It is unlikely the morlock troops would function were it not for Zanathura’s influence.
