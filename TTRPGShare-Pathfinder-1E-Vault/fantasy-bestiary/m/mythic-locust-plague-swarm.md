special_abilities:
  - name: Devour (Ex)
    desc: A locust plague swarm devours everything in its path. Its swarm attack damages all unattended objects and all attended items that are not magical. Each round, the locusts also damage one attended magic item worn or carried by each creature damaged by the swarm. Each round, the swarm can affect only one magic item per creature, even with its dual initiative. If a creature possesses more than one attended magic item, use the table for items affected by magical attacks (Pathfinder RPG Core 216) to Rulebook determine which magic item the swarm targets. The locusts’ powerful jaws count as adamantine for the purpose of bypassing DR and bypass all hardness less than 20.
  - name: Reform (Su)
    desc: A locust plague swarm is truly destroyed only if it devours a good-aligned minor artifact or holy relic.
