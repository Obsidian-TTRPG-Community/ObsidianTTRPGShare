special_abilities:
  - name: Aging Touch (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a maharishi manu in either corporeal or incorporeal form can make a touch attack against a living creature to wear down the creature’s body with age, dealing 12d10 points of damage and stunning the creature for 1 round. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A successful DC 26 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Evolutionary Sentinel (Su)
    desc: A maharishi manu gains a +4 bonus on saves to resist the effects of a dismissal spell or similar effect while visiting the world it is currently supervising.
  - name: Timeless (Ex)
    desc: A maharishi manu oversees vast periods of evolution without impediment. It is unaffected by magical aging effects and spells that manipulate time. Whenever a creature under the effect of time stop (or a similar effect) comes within 1 mile of a maharishi manu, the maharishi manu instantly gains the ability to act normally during the remaining duration of the effect, allowing the two creatures to interact.

## Description
Serene, introspective, and simultaneously old and timeless, a maharishi manu often sits in quiet contemplation, speaking only rarely and acting only when it must. When it does communicate, it tends to do so telepathically, and phrases its advice and commands as strange riddles that seem nonsensical at first, but grow increasingly meaningful as listeners overcome struggles and grow on their own.

 Maharishi manus are at the pinnacle of the manu caste of manasaputras, leading the hierarchy by following directions set by the kumaras and the Logos at the center of the Positive Energy Plane. These outsiders govern the spiritual development over vast epochs, teaching lesser manus and guiding all mortal incarnations toward a sense of perfect enlightenment. Because of the nature of their missions, maharishi manus form strong bonds with the inhabitants of the planets under their care and are never kept away for long before returning to those worlds should they be banished by malicious forces.
