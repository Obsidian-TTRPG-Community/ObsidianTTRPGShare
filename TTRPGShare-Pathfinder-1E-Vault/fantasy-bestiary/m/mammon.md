special_abilities:
  - name: Argent Prince (Su)
    desc: In his true form, Mammon lacks a body. The archdevil relies entirely on his possession spell-like abilities to interact with the physical world. In his true form, Mammon gains the incorporeal quality, gains a deflection bonus to his AC equal to his Charisma modifier (+11), and replaces his base speed of 50 feet with a fly speed of 80 feet (perfect maneuverability); he loses all abilities that rely on a physical body (including his Strength score, the additional immunities gained from possessing the Argent Prince (see below), air walk, his natural armor bonus, and his natural attacks). 

Mammon rarely interacts with others without possessing a body, and his favorite body to possess is that of the Argent Prince-a powerful unique construct that represents the archdevil’s ideal form. The Argent Prince always fails its saving throw against Mammon’s greater object possession spell-like ability, and Mammon can call the Argent Prince to his side across any distance (even across planar boundaries) as a swift action-when he does so, he can possess the Argent Prince immediately. While possessing the Argent Prince, Mammon gains air walk as a constant spell-like ability; the gleaming glory ability (see below); and immunity to bleed, disease, necromancy effects, paralysis, sleep effects, and stunning. When Mammon is not possessing the Argent Prince (typically because he is possessing another object or being), the Argent Prince loses all of its spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities, but remains under the control of Mammon and can continue to fight or take other actions as Mammon directs. If the Argent Prince is destroyed, Mammon can rebuild it, but doing so requires the archdevil to remain sequestered in his workshop deep in Erebus for a year.
  - name: Gleaming Glory (Ex)
    desc: The Argent Prince’s gleaming metallic body reflects light and magic. In bright light, a creature within 60 feet is automatically dazzled, while one that moves or begins its turn within 10 feet is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 37 Fortitude save or averts or closes its eyes as for a gaze attack. Rays and magical ranged touch attacks have a 20% miss chance against the Argent Prince, and such missed attacks have a 20% chance of being redirected toward a random target within 60 feet; otherwise, they are deflected harmlessly. While possessed by Mammon, the Argent Prince increases both chances to 50%, and if the creator of an effect deflected by this ability is within 60 feet, Mammon can reflect it at that creature instead of choosing randomly. Gaze attacks and light-based effects (including color spray and prismatic spray) targeting Mammon have the same chance as rays of being reflected, while area effects of this nature simply do not affect him. Mammon also has the same chance to move without harm through a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mammon’s Mark (Su)
    desc: Any coin, gemstone, piece of jewelry, or art object that Mammon touches bears his invisible image for 13 days. He can sense the location of marked items (as per locate object, even if such an object is in an extradimensional space), and can communicate through them as per enter image. In both cases, this effect has 10 times the normal range (or unlimited range within Mammon’s domain on Erebus). If a creature has a marked object in its possession for 24 hours, Mammon can locate that creature (as per locate creature with the same increase to range as above) at will as a free action, even if the marked object is discarded. Mammon gains a +10 bonus on caster level checks and to the save DC of scrying effects he uses against such creatures. If the creature is protected by an effect that protects against scrying and Mammon is in Erebus, the archdevil can expend one use of his mythic power to ignore that effect. This is a curse effect.
  - name: Plunderer (Su)
    desc: Mammon can sense wealth within 300 feet as if using a rod of metal and mineral detection. He also gains a +10 bonus on Appraise checks and on Spellcraft checks to identify the magical properties of items, can attempt either check once per round as a free action to determine the value or properties of any item within his line of sight, and gains a +10 bonus until the end of his turn on combat maneuver checks to disarm a creature of or steal an item he has thus appraised or identified.

## Description
Mammon is the master of avarice, a fallen angel long in service to Asmodeus; though slain by his enemies long ago, his spirit lingered in his hellish sepulcher, unwilling to surrender to oblivion. His hunger for life infused his spirit into the obscene wealth heaped about him in death, until he became one with the wealth of ages. The Grasping One is now vault keeper for all of Hell, growing ever more resplendent as he discovers new treasures to incorporate into his form and reporting directly to Asmodeus on Hell’s accounts. 

Mammon can possess objects and creatures with ease, but most often possesses the Argent Prince, a peerlessly sculpted 8-foot-tall metallic likeness of his former angelic glory, tastefully tainted with accents of his diabolic nature.
