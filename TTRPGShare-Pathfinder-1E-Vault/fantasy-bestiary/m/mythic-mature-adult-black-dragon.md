special_abilities:
  - name: Corrupt Water (Sp)
    desc: Once per day, a black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water within 210 feet, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature’s possession must succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.

    desc: A black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    desc: A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

## Description
A mythic black dragon eyes can pierce fog to find prey. Its very flesh and blood is infused with deadly acid, and like a snake it can gulp down an entire meal without chewing. A mythic black dragon enjoys regurgitating a swallowed opponent to let it rot for a few days before eating it as an actual meal, or repeats this cycle on a living creature as cruel torture.
