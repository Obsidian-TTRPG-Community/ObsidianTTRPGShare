  - name: Frightening Howl (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action (but no more often than once per hour), a mapinguari can emit a terrifying howl that can be heard up to 1 mile away. The effects of this howl increase in severity the closer a creature is to the mapinguari, but can be negated with a successful DC 18 Will save. Creatures within 30 feet that fail their saving throws become paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds, then panicked for 1d4 rounds, and then shaken for 24 hours. At a range of 31-90 feet, creatures that fail become panicked for 1d4 rounds, after which they are shaken for 24 hours. Creatures beyond 90 feet up to the full range of 1 mile that fail their saving throws are merely shaken for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Once a creature successfully saves, it is immune to that particular mapinguari’s frightening howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Landbound (Ex)
    desc: A mapinguari fears deep water and is unable to cross lakes, rivers, or streams wider than 10 feet. It is unaffected by shallow puddles and similar wet areas. A mapinguari forced into a body of water becomes staggered and does everything it can to exit the water as quickly as possible. The mapinguari sinks in water and cannot swim-it must walk through water to escape, and runs the risk of drowning in water that is 20 feet deep or deeper.

## Description
The mapinguari is a creature of legend, a beast many claim to have seen, though few who actually encounter one live to tell their story. A mapinguari patrols a territory so large that some believe each claims an entire jungle as its own. However, those more familiar with the legends know that a mapinguari’s territory is greatly limited by lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water. 

A mapinguari stands approximately 20 feet tall and weighs 15,000 pounds.
