special_abilities:
  - name: Absorb Light (Su)
    desc: Mordiggian’s presence causes all light levels within a 100-foot spread to be reduced by one category as long as he has at least 1 hit point. Anyone who attempts to cast a spell with the light descriptor in this area must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check, or the spell is lost as if it had been counterspelled.
  - name: Dreams of Darkness (Ex)
    desc: Mordiggian can affect a creature that has been restored to life by a worshiper of Mordiggian, that has suffered negative energy damage while within the walls of a temple devoted to Mordiggian, or that has been in the area of effect of Mordiggian’s unspeakable presence (whether or not the creature was affected by it) with dreams of darkness. When Mordiggian uses his nightmare spell-like ability on such a target, the victim endures what seems to be the passage of hundreds of years imprisoned in a lightless sarcophagus or coffin. Upon waking, the creature takes an additional effect beyond the normal effects of nightmare-it must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude saving throw or contract an accelerated form of ghoul fever that inflicts its damage every hour instead of every day. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Eldritch Insight (Ex)
    desc: The whispers of all the world’s dead echo in Mordiggian’s mind, and as a result, he adds his Wisdom modifier as an insight bonus to his Armor Class and on all Initiative checks. If Mordiggian is on a planet or in a dimension where no creature has ever died, this ability does not function.
  - name: Engulf (Su)
    desc: When Mordiggian engulfs a creature, he inflicts 20d6 points of negative energy damage and 1d4 negative levels. A successful DC 44 Reflex saving throw halves the negative energy damage, and a DC 44 Fortitude save removes the negative levels. The save DCs are both Constitution-based.
  - name: Great Old One Traits
    desc: Rules for Mordiggian’s Great Old One traits such as immortality, insanity, and otherworldly, as well as the rules for his mythic abilities and unspeakable presence can be found on page 306 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4.
  - name: Immortality (Ex)
    desc: If Mordiggian is killed, the shadows that comprise his body lose all form and become a 20-foot-diameter roiling blot of churning darkness with a 300-foot fly speed and perfect maneuverability. This blot of darkness is incorporeal and cannot be harmed, but it cannot enter an area of bright light. The blot can sense all undead creatures within a 100-mile radius, and if it finds an undead creature, it can attempt to infuse it. An intelligent undead can resist this attack with a successful DC 40 Will saving throw; unintelligent undead receive no save. Once this blot of darkness infuses an undead creature, it grants the undead creature the advanced creature simple template, but 24 hours later, the undead is destroyed, releasing a fully-healed Mordiggian back into the world. If Mordiggian cannot find a suitable undead host within 24 hours or is trapped by bright light for that duration, the blot of darkness fades away, only to manifest immediately on another world-perhaps in the distant past, in the distant future, or even in the present. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Tentacles (Su)
    desc: Mordiggian’s tentacles are primary attacks that inflict bludgeoning damage. He adds his Charisma modifier to damage done by his tentacles, which also gain a +5 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. These tentacles are treated as magic epic chaotic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If Mordiggian reduces a living creature to fewer than 0 hit points with a tentacle or with his constriction damage, he automatically casts death knell on the target as a free action.
  - name: Unspeakable Presence (Su)
    desc: Failing a DC 40 Will saving throw against Mordiggian’s unspeakable presence causes the victim to become permanently blinded. A creature that is killed while blinded by this ability immediately animates as a chaotic evil juju zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 291). The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Called the Charnel God by his worshipers, Mordiggian is one of the oldest and most powerful of the Great Old Ones. However, his tendency to move back and forth in time whenever he reincarnates makes the tracking of his age largely academic. None can say how long Mordiggian has existed, for as far as one can look back into the past or forward into the future, the presence of his cult can be found if one searches hard enough.

Mordiggian has no body. He appears as a cloud of mobile, malevolent darkness and shadow that can change its outline and shape at will. He is fond of appearing as an immense graveworm or limbless giant made of darkness, and when he desires a meal, he can form tentacles of solid darkness to pluck up his feast.

Ghouls, particularly those that dwell in Leng, often venerate Mordiggian with a ferocious zeal. They consider ghoulish worshipers of other deities, particularly of the demon lord Kabriri, to be heretics and work to eradicate such blasphemers whenever they are found. Although worship of Mordiggian has become quite rare on Golarion as other death gods have gained more prominence, his cult is patient and willing to simply wait for the Charnel God’s inevitable return to power.
