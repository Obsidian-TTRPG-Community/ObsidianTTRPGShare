    desc: All allies that belong to the manu’s creature bond work toward a unified goal while within 30 feet of the manu. As an immediate action, the manu can attempt an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check to replace the roll just made by an ally benefitting from the manu’s aura of unity.

    desc: Each manu is associated with a single race or kind of creature, such as humans or basilisks (not humanoids or magical beasts); this bond never changes. The manu is treated as both a manasaputra and as the race, creature type, and subtypes of its bonded creature for the purposes of effects that target a specific race or kind of creature.

## Description
Manus aspire to elevate members of a specific race or type of creature to enlightenment, adopting them collectively as special charges. Typically, this race or type of creature is chosen from those to whom the manu belonged during its most meaningful mortal incarnation, but this is not always the case.

 While most manus focus on a people’s enlightenment across a single Material Plane world, some ambitious manus follow their charges from world to world, continuing to elevate and guide them as they propagate among the stars. Manus are largely solitary, though they sometimes gather into tight-knit groups called rounds that coordinate efforts to guide their chosen peoples.
