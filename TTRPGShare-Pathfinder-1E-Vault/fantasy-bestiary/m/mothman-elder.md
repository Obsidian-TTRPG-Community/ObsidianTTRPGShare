special_abilities:
  - name: Mind-Warping Gaze (Su)
    desc: See page 194 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2.
  - name: Obliteration Ray (Su)
    desc: As a swift action, a mothman elder can fire a ray of devastating energy as a ranged touch attack that deals 8d6 points of damage (or 8d8 points of damage against an object, automatically bypassing hardness). This attack deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, as chosen by the mothman elder at the start of its turn. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment.
  - name: Warp Elements (Su)
    desc: A mothman elder’s presence distorts the perceptions of those around it, to the point that they believe it is either suddenly swelteringly hot or numbingly cold. Any creature that starts its turn within 120 feet of a mothman elder must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or immediately succumb to the effects of extreme heat (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) or extreme cold (Core Rulebook 442). A mothman elder can switch between emitting a hot or cold aura as a move action. This effect lasts as long as the target remains within the area of effect and for 1d6 minutes afterward. A target may attempt a new Will save every minute to prematurely end the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect-the heat and cold are not real, and thus energy resistance and spells like endure elements have no effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Description
Mothmen that are captured or fail to accomplish their goals answer to greater beings. Called elders by their kin, these cataclysmic creatures are taskmasters in charge of disciplining renegade mothmen and disposing of damning evidence that might bring knowledge of the mothmen to public light. This means hunting down and destroying individuals that reveal themselves to too many or fail in fulfilling destiny.

A mothman elder is 8 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
