    desc: When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a crocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check.

If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple.

## Description
Crocodiles are depicted in many ways in ancient Osirion, but most often they are shown in association with the River Sphinx and, more importantly, with the god Sobek. Mummified crocodiles are common in crypts that are no farther from the river than a single day’s walk. Many mummif ied crocodiles have baby crocodiles placed on their backs or in their mouths, representing how live crocodiles transport and care for their young.
