special_abilities:
  - name: Bone Eruption (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a mythic bone devil can expend two uses of mythic power to call to the bones of all enemies within a 20-foot-radius burst. The bones shudder and twist within each creature, dealing 10d6 points of damage and giving each creature the sickened condition for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened condition. If this damage kills a creature, some of its bones tear free from its body and fuse with the bone devil, healing it for 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die of the slain creature. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Pain Blast (Su)
    desc: Once per round as a free action, a bone devil can stimulate extreme pain in one creature within its reach. The creature takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks until the start of the devil’s next turn or until it moves at least 60 feet away from the devil.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Sting-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Description
Forged from the souls of the first heretics and blasphemers, mythic devils have an ancient legacy of torture and using secrets to lure mortal diabolists into temptation. A mythic bone devil leads Hell’s inquisitors in the efforts to root out disobedience among other devils. The authority it wields is even more powerful than its formidable magic, and it commands respect and fear from even pit fiends and dukes of Hell.
