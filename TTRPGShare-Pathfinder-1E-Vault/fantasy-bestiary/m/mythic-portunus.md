special_abilities:
  - name: Alter Luck (Su)
    desc: As an immediate action, the portunus can spend a point of mythic power to roll its surge die and apply the result as a positive or negative modifier on a d20 roll after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll. The affected creature must be within 60 feet of the portunus.
  - name: Bonded Harbor (Ex)
    desc: When on the Material Plane, a portunus attunes itself to a natural bay, fjord, or inlet. While in its bonded harbor, a portunus is considered to be on its home plane and does not gain the extraplanar subtype. A portunus loses its fast healing when not on the Plane of Water or within its bonded harbor.
  - name: Boon (Su)
    desc: Though a portunus cannot grant spells, it can grant a minor boon to those who properly propitiate it. To receive the boon, a character must perform a 1-minute ritual in or adjacent to the portunus’s bonded harbor and succeed at a DC 21 Knowledge (nature) check. The ritual fails if the portunus is not in its harbor or if it has an attitude of unfriendly or hostile to the supplicant. If the ritual is a success, the character can call upon this boon once within the next 24 hours to roll twice on a skill check and take the better result. A character cannot benefit from more than one boon at a time and cannot attempt this check more than once per day. Granting a boon requires no action by the portunus, and there is no limit on the number of boons it can grant.
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    desc: A portunus can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and attempting a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25 or equal to the result of the boat captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the portunus, the portunus takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check. The portunus can spend points of mythic power (as part of this action) to reduce the penalty by 10 for each point of mythic power spent.
  - name: Liquid Form (Sp)
    desc: As a standard action, a portunus can turn into a mobile pool of water. This functions as gaseous form, except the portunus can’t fly in this form, but it can enter water. It retains its base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120 feet. The portunus can end this ability as a standard action.
  - name: Transparency (Su)
    desc: A portunus’s body is transparent, rendering it effectively invisible when underwater. It can become visible or transparent at will as a free action.

## Description
Portunuses are a kind of water elemental who inhabit natural harbors. They embody both the regular rising and falling of the tides and the inconstant shifting of the weather. Humanoids who live along bays inhabited by portunuses often revere them as genii loci, and they may give prayers and offerings to the elementals in hopes that their ship will come in-whether literally or figuratively. A portunus is naturally invisible underwater, but when it chooses to be seen, it resembles a translucent, statuesque humanoid with four arms and two faces. The portunus’s faces can be the same or different genders. They move about the elemental’s head independently, sometimes facing in opposite directions and at other times cheek to cheek. The portunus can sense and speak from either or both faces, though it has a single mind.

 When standing, a portunus towers nearly 24 feet tall and weighs around 12,000 pounds.
