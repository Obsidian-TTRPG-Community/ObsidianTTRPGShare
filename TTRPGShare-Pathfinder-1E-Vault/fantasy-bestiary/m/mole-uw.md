## Description
Moles are small rodents that live primarily in burrows underground. While many varieties of moles exist, most share common features that include subterranean habitats, poor eyesight, and the ability to dig long distances with their powerful forelimbs.

 The typical mole is 6 inches long and weighs less than a pound.
