special_abilities:
  - name: Fighter Training (Ex)
    desc: Zanas treat their Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats and other abilities. They are proficient with the longsword, the longspear, heavy armor, and all shields (except tower shields).
  - name: Instant Armament (Su)
    desc: As a swift action, zanas can instantly equip themselves with magical armor and weapons. This grants a zana a +8 armor bonus to AC. A zana’s weapon can take one of two forms, which the zana can switch between as a swift action: a +2 keen thundering longspear or a +2 keen thundering longsword and light shield. When wielding the shield, the zana gains a +3 shield bonus to AC. This armament is a manifestation of the zana’s life force and disappears if the zana is killed. A zana can dismiss these armaments as a free action.
  - name: Petrifying Glance (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a zana can target a creature within 30 feet with a petrifying glance. The target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or be turned to stone permanently. A zana can use this ability a number of times per day equal to their Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The zana can later touch the petrified creature to return it to normal as if they had cast stone to flesh. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Protective Aura (Su)
    desc: All allied creatures within a 10-foot radius of the zana are immune to charm and fear effects.
  - name: Sitebound (Ex)
    desc: A zana is bound to the mountain they call home and can never stray beyond its foot. Each day the zana spends away from the mountain, they must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage that cannot be healed until the zana returns to their mountain. Eventually, any zana separated from their mountain dies from this damage.
  - name: Unearthly Grace (Su)
    desc: Zanas are imbued with unnatural grace. A zana adds their Charisma bonus as a resistance bonus on saving throws and as a deflection bonus to AC.

## Description
From Cheliax to the Mwangi Expanse to far-flung Tian Xia, nearly every culture on Golarion has legends about fierce and beautiful fey warriors who defend their wild, lofty homes and the innocents who visit them. These wondrous, protective spirits are called zanas, the guardians of the mountains.
