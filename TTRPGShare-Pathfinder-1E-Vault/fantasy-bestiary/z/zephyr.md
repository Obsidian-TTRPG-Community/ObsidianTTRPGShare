special_abilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: A zephyr’s breath weapon is a thunderous blast of wind. Creatures in the area of the breath weapon take 6d6 points of electricity damage and are affected as by a windstorm (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439). Creatures that successfully save against this effect take half damage and avoid the effects of the wind. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    desc: A zephyr can shift between its equine shape and that of a unique Large, winged humanoid as a standard action. When a zephyr is in humanoid form, its land speed becomes 40 feet, and its fly speed remains unchanged. Its hoof and bite attacks are replaced with two slam attacks that deal 1d8+7 points of damage plus 2d6 points of sonic damage, and its reach increases to 10 feet. It can use all of its other abilities in this form. A zephyr doesn’t revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are considered its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.
  - name: Powerful Hooves (Ex)
    desc: A zephyr’s hooves are primary attacks.
  - name: Thundering Blows (Su)
    desc: A zephyr’s natural weapons (including its trample attack), as well as any bludgeoning weapons it wields, deal an additional 2d6 points of electricity damage.
  - name: Wind Resistance (Ex)
    desc: A zephyr is treated as if it were two size categories larger for the purposes of determining the effects high winds have upon it.
  - name: Wind Senses (Su)
    desc: A zephyr’s vision is not obstructed by fog, mist, weather conditions, or wind-blown particles. This includes magical effects as well as natural effects.

## Description
Zephyrs are nature spirits tied to the weather. Some more social zephyrs enjoy cavorting with athletic mortals, but their wanderlust means that their good graces last at most a matter of months before they vanish for at least as long, seeking new horizons and racing storms. Zephyrs are seen by some as minor divinities of weather or as servants of Gozreh or the Eldest.

When attacked or provoked into aggression by a perceived offense, a zephyr uses its breath weapon to scatter foes and then takes advantage of its mobility to trample or pounce on whichever enemy seems most isolated or physically imposing. A zephyr uses its spelllike abilities to prevent foes from regrouping. True to its proud fey nature, a zephyr rarely admits defeat without planning to turn the weather against an adversary at a later time as part of a vengeful ambush.

A zephyr in its equine form is the size of a large horse and weighs over 1,000 pounds. A zephyr in its humanoid form usually stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs around 400 pounds, possessing an athletic build with feathered wings spanning 15 feet.
