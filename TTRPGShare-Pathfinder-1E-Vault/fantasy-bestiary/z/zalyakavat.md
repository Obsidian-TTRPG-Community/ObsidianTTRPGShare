special_abilities:
  - name: Inconspicuous Urumi (Su)
    desc: A zalyakavat can wear an urumi in its belt slot and draw it as a free action. While wearing an urumi in its belt slot, the zalyakavat gains a bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks equal to the weapon’s enhancement bonus, if any. If the urumi has an enhancement bonus of +2 or higher, the zalyakavat also gains the benefit of nondetection with a caster level equal to the zalyakavat’s caster level plus the weapon’s enhancement bonus.
  - name: Spells
    desc: A zalyakavat casts spells as a 10th-level sorcerer.
  - name: Urumi Affinity (Su)
    desc: A zalyakavat doesn’t drop its urumi when panicked or stunned, and it treats its reach with an urumi as 5 feet greater than normal.
  - name: Urumi Forms (Su)
    desc: When holding an urumi in one paw and carrying nothing in its other, a zalyakavat can expend unused spell slots to activate a variety of special abilities and weapon modifications known collectively as urumi forms. Activating an urumi form is a swift action, and the zalyakavat cannot cast spells during a round in which it activates one. Whenever the zalyakavat activates an urumi form, in addition to the other effects below, the zalyakavat gains the benefit of freedom of movement until the start of its next turn. The zalyakavat can select from the following urumi forms, each of which last until the start of the zalyakavat’s next turn. 

Contingent Strikes: A zalyakavat can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to imbue an urumi it wields with a single magic weapon special ability. The special ability is added to any the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. The zalyakavat can select from the following special abilities. 1st-level slot-corrosive, flaming, frost, ghost touch, shock; 2nd-level slot- axiomatic, corrosive burst, flaming burst, icy burst, shocking burst, unholy, wounding; 3rd-level slot-speed; 4th-level slot-brilliant energy; 5th-level slot-vorpal. Imbued magic weapon special abilities do not function for any creature other than the zalyakavat. 

Deft Strikes: A zalyakavat can expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to gain Improved Disarm and Improved Trip as bonus feats, as well as a competence bonus on disarm and trip attempts equal to the level of the spell slot expended. 

Dispelling Strikes: By expending a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a zalyakavat can disrupt magic with an urumi it wields, causing any creature struck by the zalyakavat’s urumi to be the subject of a targeted dispel magic with a caster level equal to the zalyakavat’s caster level plus the level of the spell slot expended. A creature can be the subject of only one such targeted dispel per use of this ability, but if the urumi strikes more than one creature, each creature struck is subject to the dispelling effect. 

Garrote Whip: A zalyakavat can expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to make an urumi it wields longer and more flexible. The zalyakavat’s reach with the weapon increases by 5 feet, and the zalyakavat can attempt to strike and strangle a single target as a standard action. The zalyakavat makes a melee attack at its highest bonus. On a successful hit, the attack deals damage as normal, and the zalyakavat can attempt a combat maneuver check against the target’s CMD as a free action. This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the maneuver succeeds, the target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage plus the zalyakavat’s Strength modifier and must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or fall unconscious for 1d4 rounds. This ability works only on creatures that breathe and have a discernible neck. The save DC is Strength-based. 

Whip of Many Blades: A zalyakavat can expend a 5th-level spell slot to cause extra blades to sprout from the hilt of an urumi it wields. When the zalyakavat makes a full attack with the weapon, it can make two extra attacks at its highest base attack bonus. This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as haste.

## Description
Shrew-faced rakshasas with a lust for physical combat, zalyakavats are spiritually and magically bound to their weapon of choice, the urumi. Fueling their whip-like swords with arcane power, they perform astonishing feats of martial prowess. To sate their lust for swordplay, zalyakavats continually seek opponents to challenge.

 A zalyakavat stands 6 and a half feet tall and weighs around 170 pounds.
