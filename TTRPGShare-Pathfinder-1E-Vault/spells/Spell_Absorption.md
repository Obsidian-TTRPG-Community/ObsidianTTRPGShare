**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S, M (a prism)

**duration**:: 1 round/level

### Description 

If you successfully counterspell a 3rd-level or lower level spell (through either *dispel magic* or normal means) while *spell absorption* is in effect, you absorb the countered spell and use it to regain spells you have already cast. If you’re a wizard, you regain the use of any single spell that you have cast since the last time you prepared spells. If you’re a sorcerer, you regain a single spell slot. The spell recovered or spell slot regained must be of an equal level or lower than the spell you counterspelled.
