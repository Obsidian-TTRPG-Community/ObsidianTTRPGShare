## Tattoo Potion

**source**:: Inner Sea Magic pg. 62  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: alchemist 2, arcanist 2, bard 2, investigator 2, redmantisassassin 2, skald 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 minute  
**components**:: V, S, M (a potion to be tattooed, special inks worth 500 gp)

### Effect

**range**:: one potion  
**effect**:: one *spell tattoo*  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

When you cast this spell, you mix special tattoo inks into a potion of your choice. Once you finish casting *tattoo potion*, the potion begins bubbling and fizzing-if no one drinks the potion within 1 minute of the spell being cast, the potion bubbles away into vapor and is destroyed.  
  
When a potion under the effects of *tattoo potion* is imbibed, the effects of the potion do not occur. Instead, the potion transforms into a *spell tattoo* (see page 16) on the drinker’s chest tattoo slot-if the drinker already has a magic tattoo in this location, the *tattoo potion* is wasted. Once the potion transforms into a *spell tattoo*, it remains in place permanently until it is used as a *spell tattoo*.
