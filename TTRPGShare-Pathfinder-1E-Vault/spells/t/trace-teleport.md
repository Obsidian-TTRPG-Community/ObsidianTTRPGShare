### Description

You immediately become aware of any teleportation effects that begin or end within the spell’s area. The spell’s area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the exact origin point of any teleportation effect that originates within the spell’s area, and the exact end point of any teleportation effect that terminates within the spell’s area. Further, you can detect the lingering traces of any teleportation effect that occurred up to 1 hour previously, in the same fashion. You intuitively know, to the nearest minute, when the teleportation effect occurred.  
  
Whenever you detect the origin point or termination point of any teleportation effect with this spell, you can study that origin point or termination point for 1 round. If you do, you can attempt a caster level check (DC = 11 + the teleportation effect’s caster level), taking a -5 penalty if the effect occurred more than 1 minute ago. If you succeed, you gain a glimpse of the teleportation effect’s termination point (if you detected an origin point) or origin point (if you detected a termination point). This glimpse lasts long enough for you to get a brief look at the area, but not long enough to scrutinize it in detail. It doesn’t come with any geographic knowledge of the location, so it is not sufficient for *teleport* or similar magic. You can’t retry the caster level check, even if you cast *trace teleport* again.
