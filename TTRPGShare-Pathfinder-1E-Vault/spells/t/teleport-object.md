### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: one touched object of up to 50 lbs./level and 3 cu. ft./level  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (object)

### Description

This spell functions like *teleport*, except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.  
  
If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted *dispel magic* spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.
