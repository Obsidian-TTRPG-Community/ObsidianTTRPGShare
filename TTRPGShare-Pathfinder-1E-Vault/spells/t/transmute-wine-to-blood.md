## Transmute Wine to Blood

**source**:: Blood of the Night pg. 30  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: arcanist 2, cleric 2, oracle 2, redmantisassassin 2, sorcerer 2, warpriest 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (drop of animal blood)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: bottle of wine worth at least 10 gp  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description

You transform one bottle of fine wine into 1 pint of animal blood, sufficient for a creature with the blood drain ability to feed upon as if it came from a Medium animal with 1 Hit Die. If you are using the optional hunger rules (see page 22), this blood satiates an undead creature’s hunger, negating any withdrawal effects, but does not grant the creature a feeding bonus. The blood coagulates and spoils at the normal rate.
