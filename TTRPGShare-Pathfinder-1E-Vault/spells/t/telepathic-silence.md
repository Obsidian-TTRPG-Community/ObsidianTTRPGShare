### Description

Creatures within the area cannot send or receive telepathic messages, and anyone in the area casting a spell with a thought component must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell’s level; this includes the increased concentration DC for casting spells with a thought component) or lose the spell. Furthermore, the thoughts of creatures within the area cannot be detected, located, or read with thoughtsense, detect thoughts, or similar effects. *Telepathic silence* does not hinder spells that target a creature’s mind or that do not rely on communication, such as *mind thrust^OA^*.
