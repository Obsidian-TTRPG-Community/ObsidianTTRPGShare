### Description

Legend claims runelords used this spell to literally benefit from drinking the tears of their captured foes. This spell turns nonmagic liquids-including spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated drinks, tears, seawater, and similar fluids-into mead or wine of average quality. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar liquids of significance are spoiled by *tears to wine*, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type or on magic potions.  
  
Creatures that drink the mead or wine created by this spell become sharp-witted and clear-minded, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus on all Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks. This increases to a +5 bonus at caster level 9th, and to +10 (the maximum) at caster level 15th.
