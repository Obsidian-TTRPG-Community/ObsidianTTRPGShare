### Description

This spell functions just like the spell snare but those caught in it take 1 point of damage per round, as the thorn-covered vine slowly cuts into them. In addition, any attempt to escape or destroy the snare deals 1d6 points of damage to the trapped creature.  
  
A *thorn snare* can only be found with a DC 24 Search check. A trapped creature can escape by making a DC 24 Escape Artist check or a DC 24 Strength check as a full-round action.  
  
*Material Component*: A length of blood-thorn rose vine.
