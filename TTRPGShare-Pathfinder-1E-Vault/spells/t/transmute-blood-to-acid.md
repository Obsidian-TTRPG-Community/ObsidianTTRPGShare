## Transmute Blood To Acid

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 244  
**school**:: transmutation (acid, pain)
**level**:: arcanist 9, psychic 9, sorcerer 9, wizard 9

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a wax doll and a vial of acid worth 10 gp)

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: concentration (maximum 1 round/5 levels)  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude half
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You transmute blood in the target’s body to acid, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage/2 levels (maximum 12d6) each round. The creature is staggered and sickened by the debilitating pain. A successful Fortitude save each round halves the damage and negates the staggered condition for 1 round. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it dissolves, leaving only the barest trace of remains. A dissolved creature’s equipment is unaffected.  
  
Anyone who strikes the target with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6 points of acid damage as the acidic blood sprays on the attacker. If the attack is from a piercing or slashing manufactured weapon, the weapon also takes this damage.  
  
This spell has no effect on creatures immune to critical hits or bleed effects.
