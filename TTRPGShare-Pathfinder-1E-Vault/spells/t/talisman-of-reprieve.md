### Description

You imbue an item with an aura of divine amnesty, allowing all allies within the aura’s area to ignore penalties to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks resulting from a plane’s mildly or strongly aligned traits (*Planar Adventures* 62), regardless of the allies’ alignments. In addition, the item grants a +4 circumstance bonus on checks with one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill determined by you at the time of casting.
