### Description

This spell creates an illusory trail in the form of a misty and visible scent coming from the rose used as this spell’s material component. When you cast this spell, the scent of the rose leaves a faint pink-tinged illusion that ripples and flows in the area. Only you and up to six creatures you designate upon casting the spell can see the illusion. To designate a creature, you must know it well. It is not enough simply to have met that creature once or heard of the creature. When you move, this illusory scent leaves a trail, though there are no telltale signs of which direction you moved if creatures designated by this spell find a middle section of the trail. This is typically used to create backtracking method for the caster’s handpicked allies, useful for navigating in and out of mazes or labyrinthine cave complexes without leaving behind an obvious trail.
