### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action

### Description

You generate a storm of telekinetic energy that emanates from you, ripping through the spell’s area of effect with devastating force. Any creature caught in the spell’s radius takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and is dazed and stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the dazed and stunned effects.  
  
The *telekinetic storm* damages objects in the area. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the *telekinetic storm* continues beyond the barrier if the spell’s area permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.  
  
You can designate any number of creatures to be immune to the spell’s effect, though you must be capable of targeting those creatures.
