## Talismanic Implement

**source**:: Occult Adventures pg. 188  
**school**:: evocation
**level**:: occultist 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level (D) or until discharged

### Description

This spell functions as *contingency*, but you invest a spell whose level doesn’t exceed one-quarter of your level (rounded down, maximum spell level 3rd) into one of your implements that holds 2 or more points of mental focus. The spell’s school must match that of the implement, and the spell must be one that affects only your person. Casting *talismanic implement* reduces the selected implement’s mental focus by 2, including for the purposes of determining the effects of resonant powers. When you refresh your mental focus, *talismanic implement* ends automatically, even if the duration hasn’t elapsed. Unlike contingency, you may have multiple *talismanic implements* simultaneously, though a single implement can hold only one *talismanic implement* spell, and if you have any *talismanic implements*, you can’t have any other kind of *contingency* in effect.
