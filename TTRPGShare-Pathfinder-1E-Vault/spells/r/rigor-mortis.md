### Description

The joints of a creature affected by this spell stiffen and swell, making movement painful and slow. The target takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level. Additionally, the target takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity and its movement speed decreases by 10 feet; these additional effects last for 1 minute per caster level, though another creature can spend 1 minute and attempt a DC 25 Heal check to end them early. A successful save halves the nonlethal damage and negates the penalty to Dexterity and movement.
