### Description

You inscribe a series of runes upon the surface of a door or around the border of an entryway. They function as a *glyph of warding* (blast glyph), though unlike a *glyph of warding*, these runes are always visible. The runes count as a *glyph of warding* for the purpose of what spells can defeat it, placing multiple glyphs in the same area, and so on.
