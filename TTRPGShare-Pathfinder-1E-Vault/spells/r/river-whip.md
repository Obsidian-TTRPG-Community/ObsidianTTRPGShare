### Description

You create a coil of flowing fresh water, functioning a whip appropriate for your size, except you make a melee touch attack instead of a regular attack. Anything you strike with the whip takes damage and is doused with 1 pint of water. A creature with the fire subtype takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If the target is on fire, it gains a +2 bonus on its next saving throw to extinguish the flames.  
  
After you have successfully used the whip to hit a creature a number of times equal to your caster level, the water is expended and the spell is discharged. The water created by this spell is otherwise identical to that produced by *create water*.
