### Description

When you cast this spell, you ask the target whether it has a secret about a specific topic that can be described in 10 words or fewer. This can concern a person, place, or thing (such as a town’s mayor, the ring worn by a traveling merchant, or the bridge spanning a nearby river) or an easily distinguished event (such as a historic battle or a recent rash of disappearances). If the target knows a secret about the topic (information it believes isn’t common knowledge and which it would not normally tell you), it states it has a secret. The target doesn’t mention anything about the secret and doesn’t remember telling you it has a secret. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it isn’t compelled to reveal whether it knows a secret and is aware that you asked.
