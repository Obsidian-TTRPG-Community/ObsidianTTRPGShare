### Description

Summoning up the power of the tempest, you direct a current of forceful winds where you please. This spell creates a 5-foot-diameter line of wind-the direction of the wind is away from your location when you cast the spell, and remains constant in that direction for the spell duration. Creatures caught in a *river of wind* take 4d6 nonlethal damage and are knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone.  
  
A creature that begins its turn wholly or partially within a *river of wind* must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 20 feet in the wind’s direction of flow, take 2d6 nonlethal damage, and be knocked prone-a successful Fortitude save means the creature merely takes 1d6 nonlethal damage. Creatures under the effect of *freedom of movement* and creatures with the air subtype are unaffected by a *river of wind*.
