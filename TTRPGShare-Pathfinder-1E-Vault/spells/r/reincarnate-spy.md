### Description

This spell functions as *reincarnate* except that you can cause the new body to resemble a particular creature, matching its age category and sex and rerolling any race result that would be the wrong size category. The subject further gains a +5 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the chosen creature due to similar features, although it might take a penalty for being the wrong race.  
  
The spell automatically leaves you with a small piece of the creature’s new body, typically a lock of hair (useful for *scrying* and other such spells).
