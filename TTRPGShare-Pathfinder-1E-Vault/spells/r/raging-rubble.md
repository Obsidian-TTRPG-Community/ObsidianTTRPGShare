### Description

You animate an area of rubble, gravel, or other small stones, creating a dangerous, rolling area of debris. The animated rubble has a space of 10 feet and acts like a swarm, damaging (1d6 hit points) and distracting (DC 12) anything within it. As a move action, you can direct the rubble to move up to 10 feet. If the rubble is attacked, treat it as a Medium animated object with the young creature simple template and the swarm subtype.
