# Resurrection 

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 334  
**school**:: conjuration (healing)
**level**:: cleric 7, oracle 7, shaman 8, witch 8

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 minute  
**components**:: V, S, M (diamond worth 10,000 gp), DF

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: dead creature touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none, see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

This spell functions like *raise dead*, except that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature.  
  
The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a *disintegrate* spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level.  
  
Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. The subject of the spell gains one permanent negative level when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be resurrected).  
  
You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be resurrected.

# False Resurrection 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 214  
**school**:: conjuration (calling) (chaotic, evil, ruse)
**level**:: cleric 7, oracle 7, shaman 8, witch 8

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 minute  
**components**:: V, S, M (diamond worth 10,000 gp), DF

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: dead creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 day/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

This spell functions as *resurrection* except that instead of recalling the dead soul to life, the spell calls a shadow demon with the advanced simple template (*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 67, 294*) to possess the body. If you fail to overcome the subject’s spell resistance, the subject’s soul can negate the calling and gain the option to return to life (as *resurrection*) in the restored body. The possession otherwise functions (as *possession^OA^*) except that the subject’s soul is not present to resist. When *false resurrection* ends or the demon is removed from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless (like that created by clone). If the soul hasn’t been returned to life already, it has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still lives (as *resurrection*). If the body was killed, the demon is sent back to the Abyss but the subject remains dead.  
  
Attempts to identify *false resurrection* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as *resurrection* (see the ruse descriptor). A fooled viewer mistakes *false resurrection’s* aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.

# False Resurrection, Greater 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 214  
**school**:: conjuration (calling) (evil, lawful, ruse)
**level**:: cleric 9, oracle 9

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 minute  
**components**:: V. S. M (diamond worth 25,000 gp), DF

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: dead creature touched  
**duration**:: permanent  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

This spell functions as false resurrection except that it calls a belier devil with the young simple template (*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 85, 292*) to possess the body and all parts of *false resurrection* that function like *resurrection instead function like *true resurrection*.  
  
Attempts to identify *greater false resurrection* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as *true resurrection* (see the ruse descriptor). A fooled viewer mistakes *greater false resurrection’s* aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.*
