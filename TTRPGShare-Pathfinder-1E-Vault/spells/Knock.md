### Description 

*Knock* opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to *hold portal* or *arcane lock*. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, *knock* opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an *arcane locked* door, the spell does not remove the *arcane lock* but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. *Knock* does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.

## Mythic Knock 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 99  
The spell unlocks up to three means of closure instead of two. The spell automatically opens locks of simple or average quality, without requiring a caster level check to do so). If used on a door locked with *arcane lock*, you can attempt a free dispel check against it as if using a targeted *dispel magic*, adding your tier to the check.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: You can expend two uses of mythic power to target one locked item per tier, unlocking up to four means of closure on each, allowing a free dispel against an *arcane lock* on each, and automatically opening locks of up to good quality (no caster level check needed).  
  
If the door has a trap that triggers when opened, you become aware of the trap and its general nature, and the door is unlocked but doesn’t automatically open.  
  
The spell can raise a barred gate, portcullis, or similar impediment, but each one counts as two locked doors.
