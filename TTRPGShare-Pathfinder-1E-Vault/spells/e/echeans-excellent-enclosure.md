### Description

You call into being around you an invisible barrier of force within which magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed and creatures are affected as by *antimagic field*. An immobile sphere of impenetrable force surrounds the field, equivalent in all ways to a spherical *wall of force*, including its immunity to *dispel magic* and vulnerability to a *sphere of annihilation* or *rod of cancellation*. The barrier has hardness 40 and 20 hit points per caster level, and can be damaged by both mundane attacks and spells cast from outside the field. If the bubble of force is destroyed, the spell’s duration ends.  
  
Spells cannot be cast within, into, or out of the enclosure, and teleportation effects that ignore a *wall of force* (such as *dimension door* or *teleport*) are thwarted by the enclosure’s field of antimagic.  
  
*Echean’s excellent enclosure* has the same effect on summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead that an *antimagic field* does, causing them to wink out of existence for the duration of *Echean’s excellent enclosure* unless their spell resistance, if any, allows them to remain where they are within the field.
