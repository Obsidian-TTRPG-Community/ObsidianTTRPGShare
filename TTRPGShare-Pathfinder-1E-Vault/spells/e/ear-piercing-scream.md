## Ear-Piercing Scream

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 218  
**school**:: evocation (sonic)
**level**:: arcanist 1, bard 1, bloodrager 1, inquisitor 1, medium 1, psychic 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: instantaneous; see text  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude partial (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You unleash a powerful scream, inaudible to all but a single target. The target is dazed for 1 round and takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). A successful save negates the daze effect and halves the damage.

## Mythic Ear-Piercing Scream

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 92  
The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8) and the duration that creatures in the area are dazed is a number of rounds equal to your tier.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell affects a 30-foot cone rather than a single target.
