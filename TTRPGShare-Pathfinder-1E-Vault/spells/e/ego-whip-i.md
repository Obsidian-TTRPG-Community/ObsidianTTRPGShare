## Ego Whip I

**source**:: Occult Adventures pg. 169  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (emotion, mind-affecting)
**level**:: psychic 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will partial
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You can use your psychic power to overwhelm the target’s ego, leaving the target feeling hopeless and unsure of itself. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. The target takes a -2 penalty to that ability score, and is also staggered for the first round it’s affected. A successful Will save negates the staggered effect and reduces the duration of the penalty to 1 round.
