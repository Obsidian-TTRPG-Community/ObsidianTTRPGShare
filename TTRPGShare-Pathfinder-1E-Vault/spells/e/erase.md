### Description

*Erase* removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove *explosive runes*, a *glyph of warding*, a *sepia snake sigil*, or an *arcane mark*, but not *illusory script* or a *symbol* spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.  
  
Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase *explosive runes*, a *glyph of warding*, or a *sepia snake sigil*, you accidentally activate that writing instead.
