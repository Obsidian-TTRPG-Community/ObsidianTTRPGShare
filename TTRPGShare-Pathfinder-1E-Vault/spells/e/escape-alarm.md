### Description

You place a ward on an area that notifies you when a creature exits it. This functions as *alarm*, except as noted. It alerts you when a creature leaves, rather than enters, the area, and you can’t select a password to bypass its effects. Instead, when you place an *escape alarm*, you can attune up to one additional creature per caster level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to your own *escape alarm* and don’t count against the limit. Attuned creatures can enter and exit the spell’s area without triggering the alarm. If you select a mental alarm rather than an audible one, all attuned creatures receive the mental alert when someone exits the warded area.
