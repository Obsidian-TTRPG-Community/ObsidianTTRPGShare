## Enlightened Step

**source**:: Divine Anthology pg. 12  
**school**:: transmutation (air, meditative)
**level**:: cleric 6, druid 6, shaman 6, warpriest 6

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 hour  
**components**:: V, M (soothing incense worth 600 gp)

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 24 hours or until discharged

### Description

Through careful regulation of your body’s mystical energies, thoughtful control of your poise and balance, and the focus in your mind on the surety of each and every step you take, you are able to make your steps lighter than air. This grants you the benefits of *air walk*, except as noted above. Additionally, at any time during the spell’s duration, you can expend the spell’s remaining duration as a swift action in order to gain a fly speed of 120 feet with perfect maneuverability for 1 minute. After this time, the spell ends.
