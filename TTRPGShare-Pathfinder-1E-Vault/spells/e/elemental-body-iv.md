## Mythic Elemental Body IV

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 92  
Each *mythic elemental body* spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic *elemental body* spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know a lower-level *mythic elemental body* spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn *mythic elemental body II* if you know *elemental body II*, even if you don’t know *mythic elemental body I*). Each *mythic elemental body* spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against you is treated as a normal hit, as if you were wearing *medium fortification* armor.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. You can also, a number of times equal to your tier, add half your tier to the DC of one spell you cast with an energy descriptor that matches your elemental type (air: electricity, earth: acid, fire: fire, water: cold).
