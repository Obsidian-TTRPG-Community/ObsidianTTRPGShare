### Description

This spell is similar to *ethereal envelope*, but it allows you to shunt an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and seal it there within a cocoon of misty ethereal fibers. If the target fails its save, it’s forced into a cataleptic meditative state as if unconscious. However, each round at the end of its turn, it can attempt a Will save to awaken itself from this meditation. Once the target awakens, it is considered pinned, treating your caster level as your CMB and your CMD as 10 + your caster level + your ability modifier for your primary spellcasting ability score. A successful grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check leaves the creature grappled rather than pinned but doesn’t allow it to escape. However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the *ethereal envelope* spell description.  
  
If the creature breaks free of the *ethereal envelopment* or you dismiss the spell, the target is returned to its prior location on the Material Plane, as described for *ethereal envelope*, but if the target is conscious at the time, it doesn’t spend a round asleep or staggered.
