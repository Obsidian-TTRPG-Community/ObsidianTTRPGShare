### Description

You show one creature the effect of its life so far and what it might expect when it passes under Pharasma’s impartial gaze at the end of its life. Depending on the creature’s alignment and its adherence to its ethos, you can provide it a brief glimpse of the reward or punishment that waits for it when it dies by showing it a mental image of its destined plane in the Great Beyond. If the target is good-aligned, it is fascinated for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is neutral-aligned, it is confused for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is evil-aligned, it is shaken for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.
