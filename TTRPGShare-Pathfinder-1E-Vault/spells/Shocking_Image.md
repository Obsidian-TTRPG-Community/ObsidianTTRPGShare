### Description 

This spell works like *mirror image*, except the illusory doubles it creates discharge an electric shock when destroyed. An opponent that uses a melee attack to destroy one of your images takes 2d6 points of electricity damage. You must overcome a targetâ€™s spell resistance the first time you deal this electricity damage to it. Failure renders the target immune to damage from this spell.
