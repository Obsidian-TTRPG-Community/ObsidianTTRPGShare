### Description 

You create a Small minion out of mud, and it obeys your commands. The mud buddy has AC 12, 10 hit points, Strength 5, and a speed of 30 feet. It can perform any tasks an unseen servant can, plus any similar tasks its Strength allows (itâ€™s able to lift up to 50 pounds), but instead of walking on water, it gains a swim speed of 30 feet.  
  
You can command a *mud buddy* to move up to 5 feet and trip an opponent (CMB = your caster level + your spellcasting ability score modifier). After the trip attempt is resolved, the spell ends.  
  
When the spell ends, the *mud buddy* reverts to a patch of wet earth.
