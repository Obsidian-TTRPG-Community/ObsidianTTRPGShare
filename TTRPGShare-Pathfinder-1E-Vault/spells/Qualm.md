**source**:: Ultimate Combat pg. 241

**level**:: arcanist 2, bard 2, inquisitor 2, medium 2, mesmerist 2, psychic 2, skald 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level or until discharged  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

The target is suddenly beset with unexplainable doubts about the effectiveness of its actions and the righteousness of its cause. The creature takes a -10 penalty on its ability checks, skill checks, and concentration checks, until the duration ends, or until it spends its entire turn doing absolutely nothing (it spends a full-round action gaining focus). Spending an entire turn doing nothing discharges the spell.
