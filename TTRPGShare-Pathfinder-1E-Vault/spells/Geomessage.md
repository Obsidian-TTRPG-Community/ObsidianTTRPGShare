# Geomessage 

**source**:: Villain Codex pg. 237  
**school**:: illusion (figment)
**level**:: arcanist 4, bard 3, hunter 3, medium 3, occultist 3, ranger 3, skald 3, sorcerer 4, wizard 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 minute  
**components**:: V, S, M (a scrap of vellum)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: surface touched  
**duration**:: 1 day/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

You create a written message of 50 words or fewer, or else an image, a drawing, or a similar diagram. The figment hangs invisible and obscured upon the target surface for the duration of the spell. Another casting of *geomessage* is needed to cause the figment to arrange itself into the intended message.  
  
When you cast the spell, you can choose to incorporate a passphrase into the spell. If you do so, the message is protected as if *nondetection* had been cast on it for the full duration of the spell, though creatures that cast *geomessage* on the surface and speak the passphrase ignore the *nondetection* effect and cause the image to become visible until the caster speaks the passphrase again.  
  
Without a passphrase, the message simply remains invisible to those who cast *geomessage*. Detection methods like *detect magic* and *see invisibility* indicate the messageâ€™s presence but do not reveal its contents.
