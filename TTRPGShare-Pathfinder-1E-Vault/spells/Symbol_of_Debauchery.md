### Description 

You conjure a sizable symbol into being, a rune suggestive of bloated bodies, flung food, and flowing wine. This spell functions as *symbol of death*, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the *symbol of debauchery* are instead filled with lust for the nearest conscious creature. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level, even after creatures leave the symbolâ€™s area of effect. Affected creatures are compelled to rush to the nearest creature in order to caress and kiss it, and may take no other actions. Each creature receives a single Will save when the *symbol of debauchery* is triggered to negate the effect. If no other creatures are visible, an affected creature may act normally.
