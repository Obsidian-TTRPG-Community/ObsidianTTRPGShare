**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 216  
**school**:: enchantment (emotion)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You override the target’s ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as *pain strike* and *symbol of pain*) do not affect the target until this spell’s duration has expired. This does not negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain while the spell lasts.
