### Description 

This spell makes a single bag, chest, sack, or other container look and feel empty. The container must be no larger than 1 cubic foot per caster level or the spell fails. Anyone peering into or reaching into the container must succeed at a Will save or perceive the container as being completely empty. All items within the container when the spell was cast are still present, but they canâ€™t be noticed unless removed from the bag-such as by someone who can perceive them, or who upends the container.  
  
Casting *vacuous vessel* on another container or placing a new item in the existing container immediately dismisses the currently active spell.
