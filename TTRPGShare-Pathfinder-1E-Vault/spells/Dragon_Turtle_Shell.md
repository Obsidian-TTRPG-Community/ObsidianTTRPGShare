### Description 

When you are struck by an opponent’s natural attacks, the damage is resolved as if the attack came from a creature one size smaller per 5 caster levels (maximum of four size categories smaller at CL 20th). Refer to Table 3-1 in the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary* to determine an attack’s altered base damage. If the creature’s natural attack deals nonstandard damage, refer instead to the Improved Natural Attack feat on page 315 of the *Bestiary*. It is not possible to reduce the base damage of a creature’s natural attack below 1d2 with this spell.
