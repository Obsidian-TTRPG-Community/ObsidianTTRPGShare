### Description 

You partition your mind to maximize your mental power. Until the spell ends, you roll twice and use the higher result for all Will saves, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks. In addition, as a swift action you can have your second mind perform any purely mental action that normally requires a standard action or a move action. This includes casting psychic spells, using spell-like abilities, and concentrating on spells. Spells and spell-like abilities cast or used by your secondary mind this way canâ€™t exceed 5th level.
