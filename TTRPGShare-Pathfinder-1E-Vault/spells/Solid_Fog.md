### Description 

This spell functions like *fog cloud*, but in addition to obscuring sight, the *solid fog* is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a solid fog move at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into *solid fog* is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in *solid fog*. *Solid fog*, and effects that work like *solid fog*, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.  
  
Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.  
  
*Solid fog* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell. A permanent *solid fog* dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

## Mythic Solid Fog 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 109  
The penalty on melee attack and damage rolls increases to -4. The cloudâ€™s radius and height both increase to 50 feet.  
  
**Augmented**: The augmented version of *mythic solid fog* has the same additional benefits as the augmented version of *mythic fog cloud*.
