### Description 

As *simulacrum*, except you can only duplicate yourself, and the duplicate is created from cloth and twine rather than ice and snow. The double looks exactly like you except its eyes are balls of twine (DC 10 Perception check to recognize doubleâ€™s strange eyes). It wears clothing and gear that appear exactly like what you are wearing at the time of casting. Its copies of your magic items are nonfunctional but radiate magic and have the same auras as your items. Its aura is identical to yours. Attempts to scry you while the double exists have a 50% chance of targeting the double instead of you.  
  
The double cannot attack, has no special abilities, and has a +0 bonus on all saves and checks. You may verbally give the double orders as a free action, or control it telepathically as a standard action. You know what the double is experiencing, and when controlling it telepathically you can see and hear everything it sees and hears, though events at your location may drown out the sensory inputs from the double. The double has hit points equal to half your hit points at the time of casting. If brought to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, reverting to cloth and twine. The double is an animated object.
