**source**:: Occult Adventures pg. 170  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: medium 3, mesmerist 4, occultist 3, psychic 5, spiritualist 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: object touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description 

You banish psychic impressions from the object touched, rendering it devoid of recent history. You choose how much time to erase, up to a maximum of 1 day per caster level. You must erase impressions from the present time back; you cannot choose to leave recent events untouched. Impressions erased in this manner cannot be recovered via *object reading*, *legend lore*, or similar measures.  
  
Casting *erase impressions* on a corpse removes recent psychic impressions from when the creature was alive as well, making those memories unavailable to *speak with dead*. For example, a 5th-level caster casting the spell on a 2-day-old corpse could erase the past 2 days of psychic impressions from the corpse and 3 additional days of information from just before the creature died.
