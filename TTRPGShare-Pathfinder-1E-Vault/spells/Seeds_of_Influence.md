# Seeds of Influence 

**source**:: Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 62  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (emotion, mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 4, bard 3, medium 3, mesmerist 3, psychic 4, skald 3, sorcerer 4, witch 4, wizard 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: S, M (a rose)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You leave a magical trace in the mind of a creature with an attitude of at least indifferent toward you. The target takes a cumulative -2 penalty on its Will save to negate the spell for each step by which its attitude is better than indifferent.  
  
The target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against divination spells you cast. You can target that creature with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than *seeds of influence* as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the modified spell doesn’t take longer to cast and doesn’t use a higher-level spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast, *seeds of influence* ends for that target. A creature can be subject to only one *seeds of influence* spell at a time; later castings of *seeds of influence* remove any previous casting.

# Seeds of Influence, Greater 

**source**:: Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 62  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (emotion, mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 7, bard 5, medium 4, mesmerist 5, psychic 7, skald 5, sorcerer 7, witch 7, wizard 7

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: S, M (a rose)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 day/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions as *seeds of influence*, except that if the target is protected by a spell that grants immunity, spell resistance, or a saving throw bonus against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast on the target, you can attempt caster level checks to dispel each such effect before applying the effects of those protections against the spell. The DC of the caster level check to dispel each effect is equal to 11 + the effect’s caster level. Such spells cast on the target while *greater seeds of influence* is active grant no protection against *greater seeds of influence*.
