## Peasant Armaments

**source**:: Pathfinder \#68: The Shackled Hut pg. 69  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: arcanist 1, cleric 1, hunter 1, inquisitor 1, oracle 1, ranger 1, redmantisassassin 1, sorcerer 1, warpriest 1, wizard 1 (Milani)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: 1 improvised weapon/level  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless, object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless, object)

### Description

You transform one or more improvised weapons into equivalent simple or martial weapons. The bearer of such a weapon can wield it with proficiency (no penalty for using an improvised weapon or not having the required proficiency). This does not alter the weapon’s shape or appearance in any way. For example, if cast on a chair leg, butter knife, and pitchfork, the weapons function as a club, dagger, and trident, respectively, and anyone who wields them does so without a nonproficiency penalty, but the weapons look no different than they were before the spell.  
  
The spell has no effect on items that are not improvised weapons. For example, if cast on a short sword, it does not grant proficiency to anyone wielding it.
