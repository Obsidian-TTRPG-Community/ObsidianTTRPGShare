## Poisonous Balm

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 222  
**school**:: conjuration (healing) (poison, ruse)
**level**:: cleric 4, druid 5, hunter 5, occultist 4, oracle 4, shaman 4, witch 5

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: instantaneous, then 1 hour or until triggered plus 6 rounds; see text  
**saving-throw**:: Will partial (harmless), then Fortitude negates (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

You mend the target’s injuries, curing 3d8 hit points + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) as *cure serious wounds*, but leaving its body laced with a subtle toxin that remains inert until you activate it. A target that decides to attempt the Will save and succeeds is healed for half (as *cure serious wounds*) and negates the toxin. Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round’s damage and end the affliction. If you don’t trigger the poison for 1 hour, the spell ends and leaves the target unharmed.  
  
*Detect poison* reveals an inert *poisonous balm* only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + your caster level. Attempts to identify *poisonous balm* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as *cure serious wounds*. A fooled viewer mistakes *poisonous balm’s* aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous effect.
