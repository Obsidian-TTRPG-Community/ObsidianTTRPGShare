### Description

*Pattern recognition* allows you to notice unusual breaks in the patterns of stones in a wall, boards in a floor, cracks in glass, trees in a forest, or similar interruptions. You gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (minimum +1, maximum +10) on Search checks.  
  
You gain the same bonus on Survival checks made to follow tracks. *Pattern recognition* does not grant you the Track feat, a rogue’s trapfinding ability, or the ability to disable traps. You can use it in conjunction with those abilities if you possess them, though.
