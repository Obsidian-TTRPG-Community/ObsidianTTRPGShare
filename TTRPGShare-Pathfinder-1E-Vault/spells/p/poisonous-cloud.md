The cloud deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage per round to living creatures that fail their Fortitude saves. A creature that succeeds at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to attempt a new saving throw each round on your turn.  
  
*Poisonous cloud* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell cast by a caster of 13th level or higher, at a cost of 12,500 gp. A permanent *poisonous cloud* dispersed by wind re-forms in 10 minutes.
