## Plague Bearer

**source**:: Inner Sea Gods pg. 238  
**school**:: necromancy (disease, evil)
**level**:: alchemist 6, antipaladin 6, arcanist 7, cleric 6, druid 6, hunter 6, inquisitor 6, investigator 6, oracle 6, sorcerer 7, warpriest 6, witch 6, wizard 7 (Urgathoa)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level; see text  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates, see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You make the target an asymptomatic carrier for a host of virulent diseases. Creatures that end their turn adjacent to the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be affected as if by the spell contagion. The target itself does not become diseased, and suffers no ill effects from this spell. Once *plague bearer* ends, the target is no longer contagious, though any creature it infected remains diseased.
