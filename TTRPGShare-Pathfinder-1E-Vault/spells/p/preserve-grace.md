### Description

The Lantern Bearers must often make difficult decisions during their missions, such as determining what to do with captured enemies-should they be executed, imprisoned, set free, or given a chance to mend their ways? With this spell, you grant a creature the ability to foresee moral consequences, as if the creature were wearing a *phylactery of faithfulness*. The spell’s guidance focuses on the protection of beauty and encourages peaceful resolution and mercy.
