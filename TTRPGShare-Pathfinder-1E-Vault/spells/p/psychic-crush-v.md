### Description

This functions as *psychic crush IV*, but on a successful Fortitude or Will save, the target takes 11d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. If it is at fewer than half its total hit points, the target takes a -2 penalty on the Will save to resist this spell. This spell can be undercast.
