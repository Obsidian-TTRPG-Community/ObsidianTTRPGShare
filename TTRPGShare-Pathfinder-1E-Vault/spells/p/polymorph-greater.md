### Description

This spell functions as *polymorph* except that it allows the creature to take on the form of a dragon or plant creature. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as *beast shape IV*. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as *elemental body III*. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as *alter self*. If the form is that of a plant, the spell functions as *plant shape II*. If the form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as *form of the dragon I*. The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell.
