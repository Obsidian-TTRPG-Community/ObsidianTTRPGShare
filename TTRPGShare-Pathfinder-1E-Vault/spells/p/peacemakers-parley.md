## Peacemaker's Parley

**source**:: Dwarves of Golarion pg. 23  
**school**:: enchantment (charm) (language-dependent, mind-affecting)
**level**:: cleric 2, oracle 2, warpriest 2 (Grundinnar)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 swift action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**area**:: creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You can attempt to influence unfriendly or hostile creatures, altering their attitudes toward you. After casting, make a Diplomacy check against the creatures as a free action; you gain a +2 sacred bonus on this check against creatures that failed their saves against the spell. Even if you favorably manipulate the attitude of the affected targets, they quickly revert to their previous attitude if threatened or treated poorly.
