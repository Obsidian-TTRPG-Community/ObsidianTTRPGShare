### Description 

You create an area of total darkness. The darkness is impenetrable even to darkvision, but you can see normally within it. Creatures outside the spellâ€™s area, even you, cannot see through it.  
  
You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance. *Blacklight* counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level. *Daylight* counters or dispels *blacklight*.
