# Ice Slick 

**source**:: Monster Codex pg. 69  
**school**:: evocation (cold)
**level**:: arcanist 2, druid 2, hunter 2, magus 2, ranger 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**area**:: 5-ft.-radius burst  
**duration**:: instantaneous (see text)

### Description 

You create a blast of intense cold, coating all solid surfaces in the area with a thin coating of ice. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and falls prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage and don’t fall prone. Spell resistance applies to this initial effect.  
  
A creature can walk within or through the area of ice at half its normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure by 4 or less means the creature can’t move that round (and must succeed at a Reflex save or fall); failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill on page 87 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook* for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to attempt this check.  
  
A 5-foot square of ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points. The ice is an instantaneous effect, but persists as nonmagical ice. Under temperate conditions, the ice lasts 1 minute per level. In tropical environments, it might last only half as long. In cold environments where ice and snow persist without melting, it could last indefinitely.
