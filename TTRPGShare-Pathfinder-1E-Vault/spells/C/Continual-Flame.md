A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A *continual flame* can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.  
  
Light spells counter and dispel darkness spells of an equal or lower level.
