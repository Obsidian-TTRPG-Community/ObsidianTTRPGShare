*2 HD or less*: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)  
  
*3 or 4 HD*: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.  
  
*5 or more HD*: The creature is stunned for 1 round.  
  
Sightless creatures are not affected by *color spray*.

The range increases to 30 feet. Add half your tier to the spellâ€™s Hit Dice categories to determine its effects on creatures. (At 3rd tier a creature with 3 or fewer HD is unconscious, blinded, and stunned; one with 4 or 5 HD is blinded and stunned, and one with 6 or more HD is stunned.) Creatures that succeed at their saves are dazzled for 1 minute.
