# Curse Item 

**source**:: Pathfinder \#64: Beyond the Doomsday Door pg. 73  
**school**:: necromancy (curse)
**level**:: cleric 2, oracle 2, warpriest 2 (Groetus)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 minute  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: object touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description 

The object becomes flawed and prone to failure. The effects of this spell depend on the nature of the object.  
  
*Magic Item*: The item functions intermittently, gaining either an unreliable curse or a random dependent curse (*Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook* 536).  
  
*Nonmagical Armor or Shield*: The item gains the fragile armor quality (*Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment* 8).  
  
*Nonmagical Weapon*: The item gains the fragile weapon quality (*Ultimate Equipment* 22).  
  
*Tool*: The item gains the broken condition if a creature rolls a natural 1 while making a skill check with the tool.  
  
*Other Item*: Each day it is used, the item has a 5% chance of gaining the broken condition.  
  
This spell does not affect artifacts. The item can be sold or discarded as normal (the bearer is not compelled to keep it). If a cleric of Groetus is using an item that is affected by this spell, he or she may make a DC 20 Will saving throw to override the itemâ€™s curse for 1 day (using it as if the item were not cursed).
