### Description 

You steal the target’s face, transforming yourself into a flawless imitation of it. All of the target’s facial features, vocal cues, and identifying physical traits change, transforming it into an unremarkable member of its race and gender. You transform into a perfect likeness of the target’s true form, as if affected by *alter self*, and gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the original subject of this spell; you take no penalties on this check if the original target is of a different race, age, size, or gender.  
  
*Claim identity* prevents any other polymorph effects from restoring the target’s true face for the spell’s duration, though the target can still assume other forms or faces via magic or any natural shapechanging ability.
