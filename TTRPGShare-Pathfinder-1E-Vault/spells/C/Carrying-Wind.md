If your caster level is 10th-14th, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +20 feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 20 feet with average maneuverability). If your caster level is 15th or higher, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +30 feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 30 feet with average maneuverability).
