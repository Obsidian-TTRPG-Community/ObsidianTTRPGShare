### Description 

This spell helps build community and ensure a shared vision for the future. When any of the affected creatures succeeds at a Knowledge check to answer a question within its field of study or identify a monster and its special powers or vulnerabilities, as a free action the affected creature can share any information gained automatically with all targets of the spell. If any of the targets move out of the spellâ€™s range, the spell ceases to function for all of them until they are all within close range of you again.
