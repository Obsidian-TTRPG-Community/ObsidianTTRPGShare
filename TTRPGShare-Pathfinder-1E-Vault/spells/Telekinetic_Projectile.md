### Description 

You fling an object weighing up to 5 pounds at the target. You must succeed at a ranged attack (not a ranged touch attack) to hit your target; if you hit, you deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to both the target and the object. The type of object thrown doesnâ€™t change the damage type or any other properties of the attack, even if you throw a weapon or magic item in this way.
