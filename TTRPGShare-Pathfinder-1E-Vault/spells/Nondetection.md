### Casting

**components**:: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 50 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature or object touched  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless, object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless, object)

### Description 

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as *clairaudience/clairvoyance*, *locate object*, and *detect* spells. *Nondetection* also prevents location by such magic items as *crystal balls*. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast *nondetection*. If you cast *nondetection* on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.  
  
If cast on a creature, *nondetection* wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.
