# Project Weakness 

**source**:: Blood of the Night pg. 30  
**school**:: necromancy (curse, evil)
**level**:: arcanist 4, cleric 3, oracle 3, sorcerer 4, warpriest 3, witch 3, wizard 4 (vampire)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: living creature touched  
**duration**:: permanent  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You curse the target with the weaknesses of your kind of vampirism. The creature reacts to garlic, mirrors, ringing bells, sunlight, and so on as if it were a vampire of the same type as you. This cannot kill the target; anything that would kill it (such as a lengthy exposure to sunlight if you are a moroi vampire) renders it helpless until the curse or the harmful effect is removed. The target gains none of the benefits of being a vampire (such as fast healing or requiring special ways to be permanently killed), only the penalties.
