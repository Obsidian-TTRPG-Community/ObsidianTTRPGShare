### Description 

This spell functions like *nondetection*, except it blocks the effects of only divination spells and effects that target an area, rather than you or an object in your possession specifically. For example, *lesser nondetection* doesnâ€™t ward you against a spellcaster who is attempting to scry on you with the *scrying* spell or find an object in your possession with *locate object*, but it does protect you against effects that target an area you happen to be in, such as detect spells or *clairaudience/clairvoyance*.
