You link your senses to the target, allowing you to see and hear through its eyes and ears. As a move action you can shift your senses from yourself to the target or back again. When using the targetâ€™s senses, you are blind and deaf. When perceiving through the target, you use its normal and special senses (such as darkvision), not your own.
