### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**effect**:: 10-ft.-radius circle  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates, see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes, see text

### Description 

Your touch creates an invisible circle on a flat surface. Any outsider passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught within. Once trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard action to physically exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any form of extradimensional travel (as per *dimensional anchor*). Contained outsiders can still attack adjacent creatures outside of the circle, or target others with ranged attacks, spells, and spell-like abilities. Despite the spellâ€™s name, *devil snare* captures outsiders of any type, not only devils.  
  
As a standard action, you can dismiss the circle, expelling any outsiders still trapped within to their planes of origin (as per *dismissal*). An outsider can resist this effect with a successful Will save, enabling it to remain after the spell is dismissed.
