### Description 

You make your target look like a younger version of itself. You select how much younger it looks (for example, “10 years” or “as a young adult”). You cannot otherwise change details of the target’s appearance other than those directly associated with aging (for example, gray hair returns to its original color). The target cannot appear so much younger that it changes size. This spell does not affect any age-based modifications to ability scores or other age-related effects.
