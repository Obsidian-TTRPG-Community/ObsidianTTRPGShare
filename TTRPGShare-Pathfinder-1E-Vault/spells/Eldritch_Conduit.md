# Eldritch Conduit 

**source**:: Inner Sea Magic pg. 54  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: arcanist 2, redmantisassassin 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a small mirror)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

Originally created by a disciple of the archwizard Nex, this spell was used to turn enemy soldiers in Gebâ€™s undead armies into conduits capable of blasting spell energy back into the far reaches of the Gebite lines. Since then, it has become a favorite among arcane casters with an understanding of battlefield tactics.  
  
If the target of this spell fails to resist its effects with a Will save, he becomes outlined in faint radiance, as if via *faerie fire*. At any time before the *eldritch conduit* expires, you may cast another spell with an area effect of cone, cylinder, line, or sphere and use the subject of the *eldritch conduit* as the point of origin for that spell. Doing so ends the spell immediately. The target must be within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) in order for you to use the conduit-if the target moves out of range, the eldritch conduit effect persists but cannot be utilized by you until you get back within range.

# Eldritch Conduit, Greater 

**source**:: Inner Sea Magic pg. 54  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: arcanist 6, sorcerer 6, witch 6, wizard 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a small mirror)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**area**:: one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions like *eldritch conduit* save for the differences listed above and that the target must be within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) in order for you to use the conduit. Using a creature as a conduit for a spell ends the greater eldritch conduit effect on that creature, but does not end the effect for other eldritch conduits.
