### Description

You condense the substance of the Ethereal Plane as it interpenetrates the Material Plane. This thickened planar conjunction slows movement through the area to a crawl. Creatures moving through *condensed ether* (even incorporeal creatures), move at only half their normal speed and can’t take 5-foot steps. This slowing of movement doesn’t stack with *solid fog* or similar effects. Creatures within *condensed ether* take a -2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, and *condensed ether* prevents effective ranged weapon attacks. Even magic rays and similar ranged attacks suffer a 20% miss chance on attacks into or passing through *condensed ether*. This miss chance is not based on concealment, and Blind-Fight, *true seeing*, and similar effects do not reduce it.
