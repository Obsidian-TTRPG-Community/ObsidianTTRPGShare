## Cast Out

**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 210  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: inquisitor 3, medium 2, psychic 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will partial
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check against any *magic jar* effect (including a ghost’s malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted *dispel magic* spell, except *cast out* can dispel one such spell for every four caster levels you possess. A successful Will save halves the damage and limits the dispelling to a single spell or effect.
