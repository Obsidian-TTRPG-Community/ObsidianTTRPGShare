### Description

This spell functions as *fireball* except you can cause the bead of fire to originate from anywhere you can see within range. You can choose a number of squares within the area up to your Intelligence bonus (for magi, occultists, or wizards) or Charisma bonus (for bloodragers or sorcerers) to be struck by weaker flames; the controlled fireball deals minimum damage in those squares.  
  
Attempts to identify controlled fireball with a skill check incorrectly identify it as fireball (see the ruse descriptor).
