## Contagious Suggestion

**source**:: Blood of the Beast pg. 14

**level**:: arcanist 5, bard 4, medium 4, mesmerist 4, occultist 5, psychic 5, skald 4, sorcerer 5, witch 5, wizard 5

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level or until completed (D)

### Description

This spell functions as per *suggestion*, except the target can pass on the enchantment to other targets. The target is compelled to communicate your suggestion to another creature, forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the *suggestion* effect on the initial target isn’t negated. If a secondary target fails, it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread the *suggestion*. This spell can affect a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level. Creatures that save against this spell cannot be affected by that particular casting of *contagious suggestion* for 24 hours.
