**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D); see text

### Description

This spell functions like *hold monster*, except that the target is constricted as if by the coils of a large snake, taking 1d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage each round that it fails its save. A successful save ends both the paralyzing and constriction effects.
