## Cave Fangs

**source**:: Ultimate Wilderness pg. 228  
**school**:: conjuration (creation) (earth)
**level**:: druid 5, hunter 5, shaman 5, witch 5

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a sharp gemstone fragment worth 150 gp)

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**area**:: one 5-ft. square/level (S); the area must be a stone surface  
**duration**:: 1 day/level or until triggered (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex half (see below)
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

You create a magical trap in the area that causes deadly stalactites or stalagmites to lurch out of the floor or ceiling of a stone surface to “bite” an intruder. The magical trap is triggered whenever a Small or larger creature (other than you or your animal companion, familiar, or spirit animal) moves through the affected area. The effect of *cave fangs* depends on whether you create stalactites or stalagmites (see below). You can place these trapped squares anywhere within the spell’s range; they need not be adjacent to each other, and you can create any mix of stalactites and stalagmites you wish. *Cave fangs* can be detected and disarmed as per a magical trap with successful DC 30 Perception and Disable Device checks. All trapped squares created by a single casting are linked, and they are all disabled if one of them is. If you place the traps in an area that is occupied by a creature, the spell effect is triggered at the completion of the casting.  
  
**Stalactites**: Shards of rock drop from the ceiling, dealing 3d8 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex half) and creating an area of dense rubble that costs 2 squares of movement to enter. Dense rubble adds 5 to the DC of Acrobatics checks and adds 2 to the DCs of Stealth checks. A creature that fails its Reflex save is pinned to the ground under stalactites and rubble, gaining the entangled condition until it can free itself with a successful DC 15 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. One Small or larger creature can automatically clear the rubble by working for 1 minute.  
  
**Stalagmites**: Piercing spires of rock erupt up from the ground, dealing 3d8 points of piercing damage and knocking the creature prone (a creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and avoids being knocked prone). Once the stalagmites appear, they function thereafter as spike stones for 1 minute per caster level and then crumble to dust.  
  
If *cave fangs* is cast inside of a cave or cavern, each effect of the spell deals 4d8 points of damage instead of 3d8, and creatures that trigger the *cave fangs* take a -2 penalty on their saving throws against the spell’s effect.
