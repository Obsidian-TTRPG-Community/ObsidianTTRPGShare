**target**:: unattended object touched  
**duration**:: permanent until discharged, then permanent (see text)  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates (object), then Will negates (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object), then yes (see text)

### Description

You touch a piece of treasure or container filled with treasure and place a terrible curse upon it, choosing from any option available with *bestow curse*. The next creature to take the treasure or remove items from the container is affected by the curse, unless it succeeds at a Will save (spell resistance applies). If you are the next creature to take the treasure or get objects from the container, though, the spell discharges harmlessly instead.
