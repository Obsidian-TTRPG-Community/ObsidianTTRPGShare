## Celestial Healing

**source**:: Arcane Anthology pg. 13  
**school**:: conjuration (healing) (good)
**level**:: arcanist 1, bloodrager 1, cleric 1, magus 1, oracle 1, sorcerer 1, summoner 1, warpriest 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S, M (1 drop of blood from a good outsider or 1 dose of holy water)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 round/2 levels  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

You anoint a wounded creature with the blood of an outsider with the good subtype (such as an angel) or holy water, giving it fast healing 1. The target radiates the aura of a good creature for the duration of the spell and can sense the righteousness of the magic, though this has no long-term effect on the target’s alignment. If the target has its own evil aura, this is not suppressed by celestial healing, and can also be detected normally.
