## Contingency

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 259  
**school**:: evocation
**level**:: arcanist 6, occultist 6, psychic 6, sorcerer 6, wizard 6

### Casting

**casting-time**:: at least 10 minutes; see text  
**components**:: V, S, M (quicksilver and an eyelash of a spell-using creature), F (ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp)

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 day/level (D) or until discharged

### Description

You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting *contingency*. The *contingency* spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast *contingency*.  
  
The spell to be brought into effect by the *contingency* must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).  
  
The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the *contingency* immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (*contingency* and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.  
  
You can use only one *contingency* spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

## Mythic Contingency

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 89  
You can cast this spell on yourself or another willing creature as if the spell had a range of touch. A companion spell placed on another creature must be a spell from you, not from the creature, and affects that creature when triggered. The target can have only one *contingency* spell upon it at a time unless it also knows *mythic contingency*. The number of companion spells you can have on yourself is equal to 1 + half your tier.  
  
**Augmented (5th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time changes to 1 full round plus the casting time of the companion spell, but the duration of *mythic contingency* decreases to 1 hour per level or until discharged.
