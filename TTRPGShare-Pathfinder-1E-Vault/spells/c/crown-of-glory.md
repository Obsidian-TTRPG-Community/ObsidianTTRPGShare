## Crown of Glory

**source**:: Pathfinder Campaign Setting pg. 206  
**school**:: evocation

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 full round  
**components**:: V, S, M, DF

**area**:: 120-ft.-radius emanation centered on you  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates

### Description

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. All creatures with fewer than 8 HD are compelled to stop and pay attention to you. Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against you must make a Will save to do so. Any creature that fails this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action is enthralled for the duration of the spell (as the *enthrall* spell), as long as it is in the spell’s area. It does not try to leave the area on its own. Creatures with 8 HD or more are not affected.  
  
When you speak, all listeners telepathically understand you. You can make up to three *suggestions* to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the *mass suggestion* spell (Will save negates). Only creatures within range at the time of a *suggestion* are subject to it.  
  
**Material Component**: An opal worth at least 200 gp.
