### Description

You are able to use the Path of Numbers to substantially boost your combat preparedness, but your foresight comes at a price. Roll 3d8 and refer to the Eight Basic Energies table on page 51. After rolling, assign each die to one of the following.

-   *Energy Type*: You gain vulnerability to the energy type that matches the die’s result for the duration of the spell. You take half again as much damage (+50%) from that energy type, regardless of whether you successfully saved against the damaging spell or effect.
-   *Magic School*: For the spell’s duration, you cast all spells from the school that matches the die’s result at +1 caster level.
-   *d20 Roll Type*: You receive a +2 luck bonus on the d20 roll that matches the die’s result for the duration of the spell.
