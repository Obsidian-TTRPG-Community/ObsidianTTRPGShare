## Calcific Touch

**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 208  
**school**:: transmutation (earth)
**level**:: arcanist 4, bloodrager 4, psychic 4, redmantisassassin 4, sorcerer 4, wizard 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature or creatures touched (up to one per level)  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude partial
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. *Break enchantment*, *restoration*, or *stone to flesh* can reverse the effects of *calcific touch*.
