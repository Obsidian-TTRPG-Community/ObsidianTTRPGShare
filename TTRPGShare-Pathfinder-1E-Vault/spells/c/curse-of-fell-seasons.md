## Curse of Fell Seasons

**source**:: Horror Adventures pg. 114  
**school**:: transmutation (curse, darkness)
**level**:: arcanist 9, druid 9, shaman 9, sorcerer 9, witch 9, wizard 9

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, F (darkwood carving of a tree worth 15,000 gp)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**area**:: 2-mile radius emanating from the touched point  
**duration**:: permanent (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

By touching the ground, you drastically change the weather in the area, as the unseasonable weather curse (see page 145). The focus merges into the cursed area as part of the spell and can only be retrieved if the curse is lifted.

## Unseasonable Weather

**Type** regional curse
**area**:: 2-mile-radius emanation
**Save** Will DC 23 to remove  
  
**effect**:: The weather in the cursed region changes drastically, even bringing snow to a blazing desert. The area is plagued by your choice of cold weather conditions (Core Rulebook 442), very hot conditions (Core Rulebook 444), or frequent powerful storms (Core Rulebook 438). The weather remains unpredictable, and can change over time (as determined by the GM), but the baseline weather is altered as long as the curse remains.  
  
**Cure** The cursed weather can be returned to normal only by casting *remove curse* at the center of the affected area, followed by a casting of *control weather*.
