### Description

This spell was created by the paladins of the Mendevian Crusades, and co-opted by inquisitors and rangers dedicated to tracking and fighting demons, devils, and other evil extraplanar creatures.  
  
When you cast this spell on a melee weapon you imbue it with a powerful holy energy, granting the weapon the bane weapon quality against evil outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you not only deal normal critical damage with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3 rounds-the outsider can reduce this nauseated condition to sickened for 1 round with a successful Fortitude save.

## Mythic Crusader's Edge

**source**:: Mythic Origins pg. 12  
Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points. While wielding this weapon, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities originating from evil outsiders.  
  
**Augmented (5th)**: You can expend two uses of mythic power to give the touched weapon the *holy* weapon special ability.
