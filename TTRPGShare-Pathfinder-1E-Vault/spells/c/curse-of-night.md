### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**area**:: 1-mile radius emanating from touched point)

### Description

By touching the ground, you curse an area to remain in bleak darkness, as the endless night curse (see page 143). The focus merges into the cursed area as part of the spell and can only be retrieved if the curse is lifted.

## Endless Night

**Type** regional curse
**area**:: 1-mile-radius emanation
**Save** Will DC 22 negates  
  
**effect**:: Nonmagical light and magical light sources that produce normal light create only dim light in the cursed area, and even direct sunlight leads to only an ambient dim light in the area (similar to a full moon). Twilight and night are always dark. Creatures harmed or weakened by daylight can move about during the day in this area and the only impairment they take from the dimmed sunlight is that they become dazzled in its area. Plant growth in the area is stunted, as per the stunt growth usage of *diminish plants*. Any spellcaster attempting to cast *daylight* or a spell that creates true daylight or bright light in the area fails unless she succeeds at a Will saving throw against the curse. Success leads to normal light, rather than bright light.  
  
**Cure** An endless night can be lifted only by successfully casting *remove curse* followed by *sunburst* at noon on a clear day.
