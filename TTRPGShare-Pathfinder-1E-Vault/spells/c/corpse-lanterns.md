### Description

This spell functions as *dancing lights*, except it summons up to four spheres of light, each of which glows a sickly pale green. These *corpse lanterns* shed dim light in a 20-foot radius, and do not increase the light level in areas of normal light or bright light. In dim or normal light, the radiance of *corpse lanterns* provides a strange contrast, giving all creatures in the area a -5 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, the hue interferes with illusion (pattern) spells, giving all creatures in the illuminated area a +2 bonus on any saving throws against such spells. Unlike *dancing lights*, you may have more than one *corpse lanterns* spell active at a time, but you may only move one set in any given round. Moving the *corpse lanterns* does not require concentration. *Corpse lanterns* can be made permanent on an area with a *permanency* spell by a caster of at least 11th level for the cost of 7,500 gp.
