### Description

A creature targeted by this spell is held immobile by glowing golden chains composed of pure light. The creature is paralyzed and held in place, but may attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect. While held by the golden chains, a creature cannot use any sort of extradimensional travel, such as *astral projection*, *blink*, *dimension door*, *ethereal jaunt*, *etherealness*, *gate*, *maze*, *plane shift*, *shadow walk*, *teleport*, and similar spells and spell-like abilities. The spell does not affect creatures that are already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast.
