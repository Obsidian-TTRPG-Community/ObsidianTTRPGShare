### Description 

This spell has two versions.  
  
*Prune Growth*: This version of the spell causes normal vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed. This version of *diminish plants* automatically dispels any spells or effects that enhance plants, such as *entangle*, *plant growth*, and *wall of thorns*.  
  
At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle. You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.  
  
*Stunt Growth*: This version of the spell targets all normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to half normal.  
  
This spell has no effect on plant creatures.
