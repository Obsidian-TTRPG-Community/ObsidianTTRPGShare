### Description 

When you cast this spell, you mix special tattoo inks into a potion of your choice. Once you finish casting *tattoo potion*, the potion begins bubbling and fizzing-if no one drinks the potion within 1 minute of the spell being cast, the potion bubbles away into vapor and is destroyed.  
  
When a potion under the effects of *tattoo potion* is imbibed, the effects of the potion do not occur. Instead, the potion transforms into a *spell tattoo* (see page 16) on the drinkerâ€™s chest tattoo slot-if the drinker already has a magic tattoo in this location, the *tattoo potion* is wasted. Once the potion transforms into a *spell tattoo*, it remains in place permanently until it is used as a *spell tattoo*.
