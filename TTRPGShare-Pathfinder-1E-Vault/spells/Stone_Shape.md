### Description 

You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with *stone shape*, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.

## Mythic Stone Shape 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 109  
The duration changes to 1 round/level and instantaneous (see text). Each round after the round you cast the spell, you can spend a standard action to shape up to 5 additional cubic feet of stone you touch. Shaped stone has an instantaneous duration (meaning it does not revert to its previous form when the spell ends).
