### Description 

This spell functions as *interposing hand*, except that it can also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The *forceful hand* gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +8 bonus for its Strength score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. *Forceful hand* prevents the opponent from moving closer to you without first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the *forceful hand* and the target closer to you. The *forceful hand* can instead be directed to interpose itself, as *interposing hand* does.
