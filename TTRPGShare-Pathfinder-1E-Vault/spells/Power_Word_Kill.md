# Power Word Kill 

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 324  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (death, mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 9, psychic 9, sorcerer 9, witch 9, wizard 9

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature with 100 hp or less  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You utter a single word of power that instantly kills one creature of your choice, whether the creature can hear the word or not. Any creature that currently has 101 or more hit points is unaffected by *power word kill*.

## Mythic Power Word Kill 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 103  
Treat the target’s current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting *mythic power word kill* would instantly kill a creature with 85 hit points or fewer.  
  
You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to become exhausted.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend four uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target’s hit point total drops to the point that this spell would have killed it upon casting, it’s instantly slain.
