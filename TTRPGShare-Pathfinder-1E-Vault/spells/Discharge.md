**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

*Discharge* dissipates the charges from one technical object, temporarily depowers one electrically powered technological object that does not use charges, or severely hinders a creature with the robot subtype. If the spell targets an object with charges, the object loses all of its remaining charges. If the object is powered by electrical means other than charges, its functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds. If the spell targets a creature not of the robot subtype, it affects a random charged or electrically powered item in that creature’s possession. If the target is a robot, the robot is staggered and cannot use any energy-based attacks for 1d4 rounds. A robot that’s affected by this spell receives a new saving throw at the end of each round to shrug off the effect.

**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: arcanist 6, bard 6, cleric 6, magus 6, oracle 6, skald 6, sorcerer 6, warpriest 6, witch 6, wizard 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: or Area one creature or technological object, or a 20-ft.-radius burst  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

This spell functions as *discharge*, except it can discharge multiple technological objects and can be used to target an area.  
  
You choose to use *greater discharge* in one of two ways: an area discharge or a targeted discharge.  
  
*Area Discharge*: When *greater discharge* is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creature’s possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.  
  
*Targeted Discharge*: This spell functions as *discharge*, but if the target is a creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the target’s charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you possess.
