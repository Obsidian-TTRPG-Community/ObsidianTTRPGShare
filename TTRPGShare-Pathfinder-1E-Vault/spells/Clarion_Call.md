### Description 

The subject of this spell gains two benefits. First, the affected creature gains the ability to create a sound like the blast of a mighty horn or trumpet simply by miming the action of sounding one. Second, the subject can speak in a booming voice that carries easily over great distances, lowering the DC of any check to hear what is said by -15. This spell is particularly prized by battlefield commanders and champions who wish to make themselves clearly heard or gain the attention of their allies or foes.
