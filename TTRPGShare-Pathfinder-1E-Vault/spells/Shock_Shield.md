### Description 

This spell creates an invisible shield similar to but not as strong as the *shield* spell. This shield hovers in front of you and negates *magic missile* attacks directed at you. The disk provides a +2 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks.  
  
At any time, as a free action, you may dismiss your shield, at which point it deals 1d6 points of electrical damage to all creatures within a 5-foot burst, including you. A Reflex saving throw halves the damage.
