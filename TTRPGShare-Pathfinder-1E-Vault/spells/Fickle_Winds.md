### Description 

You create a mobile cylinder of wind encompassing every target of the spell and protecting them as *wind wall*, but not interfering with them in any way. For example, arrows and bolts fired at the targets are deflected upward and miss, but the targetsâ€™ own arrows or bolts pass through the wall as if it were not there.  
  
A Large creature counts as 4 Medium creatures for the purpose of how many targets you can effect with the spell; a Huge creature counts as 8, a Gargantuan creature as 16, and a Colossal creature as 32. This spell has no effect within the area of a higher-level wind or weather spell.
