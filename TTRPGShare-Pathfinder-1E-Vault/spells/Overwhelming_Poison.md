# Overwhelming Poison 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 221  
**school**:: necromancy (poison)
**level**:: antipaladin 4, cleric 6, druid 6, hunter 4, oracle 6, ranger 4, shaman 6, warpriest 6, witch 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (an adder's fang)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature or one dose of poison; see text  
**duration**:: 10 minutes/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

This spell increases the virulence of the targeted dose of poison, making the poison more difficult to resist. The poison is unaffected by *delay poison*, and the DC to remove it with *neutralize poison* is increased by 5. Additionally, the poison uses its own saving throw DC or *overwhelming poison’s* DC, whichever is higher.  
  
If cast on a creature that is currently suffering from exposure to one or more doses of poison, the spell applies to one of the doses of your choice, or a random dose of poison affecting the target if you don’t know what poisons are afflicting the target.  
  
If cast on a creature that is venomous, this spell affects the first dose of poison that creature delivers before the end of the spell’s duration.
