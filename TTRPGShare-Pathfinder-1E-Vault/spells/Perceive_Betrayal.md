### Description 

By donning a silver circlet anointed with blood, you gain the ability to sense traitorous intent toward a single person to whom you defer, designated when you cast the spell. The spell alerts you when a creature with traitorous intent is within 200 feet, although it doesn’t identify the source. By concentrating, you can learn the strength of the greatest threat, based on the following categories.  
  
*Ill Will*: Someone dislikes your liege, but isn’t planning to act against her.  
  
*Plotting*: Someone is actively conspiring against your liege.  
  
*Imminent*: Someone is in the process of carrying out a plot against your liege.  
  
Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting or thought-detecting effects cannot have their intent detected by perceive betrayal.
