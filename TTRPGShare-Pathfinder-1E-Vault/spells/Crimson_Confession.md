### Description 

You ward an object or an area with your personal rune or mark. You can choose for the writing to be visible or invisible, and it doesnâ€™t harm the material upon which it is placed. A *detect magic* spell causes an invisible mark to glow and be visible. If any creature other than you touches the warded object or area and fails a Fortitude save, its skin turns bright red for 1 hour per level. This coloring cannot be washed away, but it can be dispelled.  
  
*See invisibility*, *true seeing*, a *gem of seeing*, or a *robe of eyes* likewise allows the user to see an invisible mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The ward cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an *erase* spell.
