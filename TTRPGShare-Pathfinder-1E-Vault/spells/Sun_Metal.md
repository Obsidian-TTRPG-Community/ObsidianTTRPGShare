### Description 

The target weapon ignites into flame that does not hurt the weapon or the wielder, but damages those hit by the weapon. When the weaponâ€™s wielder hits with this weapon, it deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage. This damage is not multiplied in the case of a critical hit. This effect immediately ends if the weapon is submerged in water. This effect does not stack with the *flaming* or *flaming burst* weapon special ability or any other effect that grants the weapon extra fire damage. It does not function on weapons with the *frost* or *icy burst* weapon special ability or any other effect that grants a weapon extra cold damage.

The additional damage dealt by the weapon increases to 1d6 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by the weapon is dazzled for 1 round (no saving throw). On a critical hit, the target is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates, DC equal to the DC of the spell).
