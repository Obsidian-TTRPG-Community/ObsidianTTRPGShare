### Description 

The next creature you attack using your smite evil class ability is wreathed in flames that impede its movement. Until the end of the spellâ€™s duration, the target is entangled. If the target starts its turn in a square adjacent to you, it is considered to be entangled to an immobile object (you) and cannot move. A target that saves against this spell is affected for only 1 round.
