## Implant Urge

**source**:: Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 60  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 1, bard 1, medium 1, mesmerist 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, spiritualist 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will partial
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You make the target unconsciously desire a goal you define when you cast this spell. The DC of any Diplomacy check to ask the target to act in a way that it believes will lead it toward that goal decreases by 5. The target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that compel it to act in a way that it believes will lead it toward that goal. Spells that reveal the target’s goals or thoughts reveal the implanted urge as the target’s most important goal and the target does not register as thinking of anything else as long as it is presented with the focus of its urge or a way to move toward its goal. Anyone studying the target’s thoughts can notice the implanted nature of this urge with a successful caster level check.
