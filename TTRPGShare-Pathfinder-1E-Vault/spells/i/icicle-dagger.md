### Description

You create a masterwork dagger out of ice. The dagger deals 1 point of cold damage in addition to normal dagger damage. If the dagger leaves your hand for more than 1 round, it melts and the spell ends. At 6th level, the dagger functions as a *+1 frost dagger*. At 11th level, it gains the *returning* property when thrown, melting away and reforming in your hand just before your next turn.
