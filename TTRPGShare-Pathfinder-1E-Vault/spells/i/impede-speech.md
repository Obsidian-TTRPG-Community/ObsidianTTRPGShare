### Description

This minor curse interferes with the target’s ability to speak. On a failed save, the target has difficulty stringing words together. Only with great concentration can he communicate intelligibly. Speaking in combat becomes a move-equivalent action rather than a free action. If the target attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, he has a 50% chance of making an error and losing the spell. Even if he can successfully cast a spell, doing so takes 1 round if the spell’s normal casting time is less than 1 round. If the spell’s casting time is usually 1 round or longer, its casting time doubles (up until the end of *impede speech*). *Impede speech* cannot be dispelled, but *break enchantment*, *limited wish*, *miracle*, *remove curse*, or *wish* can end it prematurely.
