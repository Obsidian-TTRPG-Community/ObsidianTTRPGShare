### Description

This spell functions as *telempathic projection*^OA^, except its mood-altering effects remain dormant in the target’s mind. Upon casting this spell, the caster designates a command word or phrase, of which the target retains no memory. The next creature to speak the command word or phrase to the target triggers the implanted *telempathic projection*, treating the speaker as the original spellcaster.
