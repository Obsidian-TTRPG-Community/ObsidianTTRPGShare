### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF (cold iron ingot)

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You launch an ingot of iron at the target. If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, the target’s skeleton or exoskeleton turns into jagged shards of cold iron. Whenever the target moves, it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and is sickened for 1 round as metal spines stab into its flesh. This damage is subject to damage reduction, but it overcomes damage reduction as though it were a weapon of cold iron and magic. A creature affected by this spell can choose to remain motionless to avoid taking damage. Creatures with DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron and magic affected by this spell are nauseated instead of sickened. This spell has no effect on a creature that has neither a skeleton nor a hard carapace.
