### Description 

You imbue an object with psychic energy. The *node of blasting* unleashes a mental blast when a creature with a mind touches the object, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the creature touching the object and causing the creature to be staggered for 1 minute. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered condition.  
  
Magic traps such as *node of blasting* are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to thwart *node of blasting*. The DCs to find a *node of blasting* using Perception and to disable it using Disable Device are both equal to 25 + the spellâ€™s level. Additionally, a creature with the read aura occult skill unlock (see page 197) can attempt the same Perception check to notice a *node of blasting*.
