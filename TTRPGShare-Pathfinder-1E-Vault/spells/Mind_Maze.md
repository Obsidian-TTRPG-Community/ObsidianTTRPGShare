### Description 

This spell causes the target to act as though it’s wandering through a maze. While under the effects of the spell, the target can’t make attacks or cast spells and must take at least one move action each round to walk in a random direction determined using the guidelines for missed splash weapons (*Core Rulebook* 202). The target must move at its maximum speed during this required movement, though additional move actions after the first can cover shorter distances. If this movement takes the target into a dangerous area, such as through a threatened square or off a ledge, the target receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Walking into a harmless obstacle, such as a wall, ends the target’s movement.
