### Description 

You swear an oath not to reveal your identity, magically preventing anyone from discovering it so long as you avoid revealing your face or other easily identifiable features. The spell distorts your voice and subtly alters your body language and the appearance of your gear and any animals you use, whether as companions, mounts, or otherwise. This spell does not make you appear to be a different creature type, nor does it change your apparent height or body type.  
  
This spell provides you with a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to conceal your identity, but not on checks to impersonate anyone in particular. This spell distorts the appearance of your voice, gear, and animals in the same way each time, essentially creating an alternate persona that can be recognized by those who have observed it before.
