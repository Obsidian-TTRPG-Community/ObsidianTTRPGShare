### Description 

You can excavate and move an amount of snow, earth, dust, sand, and loose or packed rocks or ice chunks (each no more than 5 feet in diameter) whose volume fills one 5-foot cube per level. If you are buried, you can open a space around yourself and use any remaining cubes for tunneling. This spell is otherwise similar to *expeditious excavation* (*Pathfinder RPG Advanced Playerâ€™s Guide* 220). *Carve passage* has no effect on earth creatures or solid rock or ice.
