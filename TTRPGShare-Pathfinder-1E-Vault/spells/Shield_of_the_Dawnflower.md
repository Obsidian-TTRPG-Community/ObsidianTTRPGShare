### Description 

You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination as if it were a *continual flame* spell. You can only have one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as *fire shield*.

## Mythic Shield of the Dawnflower 

**source**:: Mythic Origins pg. 13  
The disk of sunlight protects you as a buckler with a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels (maximum +5).  
  
You can make a melee touch attack with your *shield of the Dawnflower* in place of a normal attack to deal its fire damage to a creature. Creatures taking damage from your shield catch on fire (Reflex negates); the save DC to extinguish the fire is equal to the DC of the spell.

# Shield of the Dawnflower, Greater 

**source**:: Inner Sea Gods pg. 240  
**school**:: evocation (fire, good, light)
**level**:: bard 6, cleric 6, magus 6, oracle 6, skald 6, warpriest 6 (Sarenrae)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level

### Description 

You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. Half of this damage is fire damage and half is holy damage (as the spell flame strike). An undead creature or a creature particularly vulnerable to light that hits you instead takes 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level. Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination equivalent to a *daylight* spell. You can have only one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as *fire shield* or *shield of the Dawnflower* (*The Inner Sea World Guide* 296).
