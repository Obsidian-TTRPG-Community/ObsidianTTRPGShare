# Harrowing 

**source**:: Inner Sea World Guide pg. 295  
**school**:: divination
**level**:: arcanist 3, bard 3, shaman 3, skald 3, sorcerer 3, witch 3, wizard 3

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, F (a Harrow deck)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 day/level or until fulfilled

### Description 

You use a Harrow deck to tell a fortune for yourself or someone else. If you cast *harrowing* on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, “hunting down the pirate king,” or “traveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword”) that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell’s duration.  
  
If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards, as detailed on page 293 of this book. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card’s alignment matches the target creature’s alignment. If the card and target’s alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit’s check. If the card and target’s alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a -1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit’s check.  
  
While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can “spend” at any time to modify that card’s associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a *harrowing* are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell’s duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed.  
  
A single creature can only be under the effects of one *harrowing* at a time. If it is subjected to a second harrowing while a previous *harrowing* is still in effect, the new harrowing automatically fails.

## Mythic Harrowing 

**source**:: Mythic Origins pg. 12  
The bonuses and penalties associated with your reading are doubled, resulting in a +4 luck bonus if the card’s and target’s alignment are identical, a -2 penalty if the alignments are opposite, and a +2 luck bonus for any other alignment. You can use each bonus twice-once at this doubled value, the second time at the normal value (+2 or +1). You must use a given card’s doubled bonus before you can use its lower bonus. Once you have used both bonuses, or when the spell’s duration ends, the spell ends and any penalties are removed.  
  
A *mythic harrowing* cast on the target of a non-mythic *harrowing* supersedes and negates the *harrowing* effect. If a creature is subjected to a second *mythic harrowing* while a previous *mythic harrowing* is still in effect, the new *mythic harrowing* automatically fails.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power during the reading, you may discard one card of your choice and draw one new card in its place, replacing the effects of the chosen card with the effects of the newly drawn card. You must keep this new card. You can use each bonus twice, both at the doubled values. Once you have used both bonuses, or when the spell’s duration ends, the spell ends and any penalties are removed.

# Harrowing, Greater 

**source**:: The Harrow Handbook pg. 9  
**school**:: divination
**level**:: arcanist 6, bard 5, skald 5, sorcerer 6, witch 6, wizard 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, F (a harrow deck)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: one creature, plus one additional creature for every 3 caster levels  
**duration**:: 1 day/level or until fulfilled

### Description 

This spell functions as *harrowing*, except it can affect an entire group of creatures and allows its subjects some measure of control over their destiny. Subjects of a *greater harrowing* spell record and spend their accumulated bonuses and penalties individually, according to their own alignment.  
  
Each participant in a *greater harrowing* can gain a special ability to seize control of fate if a card that matches that participant’s alignment is drawn. Like the bonuses and penalties granted by the spell, the special ability can be used once before the end of the spell’s duration. The exact ability gained depends on the card’s suit; if multiple cards that match a participant’s alignment are drawn, the participant can select one suit of her choice during the spell’s casting.  
  
*Hammers*: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you can reroll any bull rush, grapple, or sunder combat maneuver checks. You must use the result of this second roll, even if it is worse.  
  
*Keys*: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you gain evasion, as the rogue class feature. If you already possess evasion, you instead gain improved evasion, as the advanced rogue talent.  
  
*Shields*: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you gain fast healing 1 and don’t die until you reach a number of negative hit points equal to double your Constitution.  
  
*Books*: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you gain a +3 enhancement bonus on checks with all skills you have no ranks in, and you can use those skills even if they can’t normally be used untrained.  
  
*Stars*: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, you gain immunity to one of the following (your choice): charm and compulsion effects, curse effects, or fear effects.  
  
*Crowns*: As a standard action, you can grant yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 1 minute. While this bonus persists, whenever you succeed at a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to improve a nonhostile creature’s attitude toward you, that creature’s attitude toward you becomes helpful for the remaining duration of the Charisma bonus, regardless of the number of steps by which you would normally improve its attitude. The creature reverts to its original attitude after the duration expires.  
  
A single creature can be under the effects of only one *harrowing* or *greater harrowing* at a time. If the subject is targeted with a second *harrowing* or *greater harrowing* spell while a previous *harrowing* or *greater harrowing* is still affecting him, the new spell automatically fails for that subject.
