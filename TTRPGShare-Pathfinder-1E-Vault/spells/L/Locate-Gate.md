### Description 

You sense the direction of the nearest *teleportation circle* (permanent or with a remaining duration), *gate* spell, or other effect which magically connects two different locations (for example, an active magic item, a creature’s special ability, or unique adventure location). *Locate gate* detects only spells or effects with a permanent or ongoing duration, not instantaneous effects like *dimension door* or *teleport*.  
  
Locate gate can be blocked by spells like *nondetection*, if the effect originates from a specific object or creature. However, spell effects can’t likewise be warded. For example, *ring gates* are a specific object, but a permanent *teleportation circle* is not (the surface in which it’s inscribed doesn’t count). *Locate gate* isn’t blocked by lead, water, or other physical environmental conditions, but it is blocked by any intervening area that is dimensionally warded (such as by *dimensional lock* or *forbiddance*).
