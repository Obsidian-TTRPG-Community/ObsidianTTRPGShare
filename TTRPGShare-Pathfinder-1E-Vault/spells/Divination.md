# Divination 

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 273  
**school**:: divination
**level**:: cleric 4, inquisitor 4, medium 3, oracle 4, psychic 4, sahirafiyun 4, shaman 4, spiritualist 4, warpriest 4, witch 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, M (incense and an appropriate offering worth 25 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: instantaneous

### Description 

Similar to *augury* but more powerful, a *divination* spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct *divination* is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.  
  
As with *augury*, multiple *divinations* about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first *divination* spell and yield the same answer each time.

# Prognostication 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 223  
**school**:: divination
**level**:: cleric 6, inquisitor 6, medium 4, oracle 6, psychic 6, shaman 6, spiritualist 6, warpriest 6, witch 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 8 hours  
**components**:: V, S, M (rare incense and tonics worth 250 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

You glimpse the future. *Prognostication* functions as *divination* except that the spell can see up to a year and a day into the future. Because of the increased unpredictability of the distant future, *prognostication* is significantly more cryptic than the already-cryptic *divination* spell.

# True Prognostication 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 228  
**school**:: divination
**level**:: cleric 8, oracle 8, psychic 8, shaman 8, witch 8

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 week  
**components**:: V, S, M (rare incense and tonics worth 1,000 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: instantaneous

### Description 

*True prognostication* functions as *divination* except that the spell can see up to 100 years into the future. Because of the extreme unpredictability of the far-distant future, *true prognostication* is incredibly cryptic when used to learn about events on such large a scale.
