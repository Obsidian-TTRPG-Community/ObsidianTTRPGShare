# Hollow Heroism 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 216  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (mind-affecting, ruse)
**level**:: arcanist 4, bard 3, bloodrager 4, inquisitor 4, medium 3, psychic 4, skald 3, sorcerer 4, spiritualist 4, summoner 4, summoner (unchained) 4, witch 4, wizard 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 10 minutes/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

This spell functions as *heroism*, except that you can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the spellâ€™s duration ends (no save).  
  
Attempts to identify *hollow heroism* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as *heroism*.
