# Hex Vulnerability 

**source**:: Advanced Class Guide pg. 184  
**school**:: necromancy (curse)
**level**:: shaman 1, witch 1

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a drop of your blood)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

The targeted creature becomes susceptible to a repeat use of your harmful hexes, even if you could not otherwise target that creature with a particular hex for a certain time period. For example, normally after you target a creature with a charm hex, you cannot target it again for 1 day. But after casting this spell on a creature, you could try the charm hex repeatedly as long as the spell persists. The end of this spell has no effect on any active or ongoing hex on a creature. For example, if the creature failed its save against a second use of your charm hex, it remains charmed for the normal duration, even if the spell expires before the hex does.  
  
Each subsequent casting of this spell on a target within a 24-hour period gives the target a +4 bonus on its save against the spell and imposes a -4 penalty on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance with this spell.
