### Description 

You erase a portion of the target’s mind and experiences, inflicting 2 temporary negative levels on the target for 1 day per caster level. If the target is a spellcaster who must choose and prepare spells in advance, each negative level imposed by *mindwipe* also causes the target to lose one prepared spell from her highest level of spells known for each of her spellcasting classes for which she must prepare spells. These lost spells are no longer considered known by the target until the corresponding negative levels are removed.  
  
If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, each negative level inflicted by *mindwipe* causes her to lose one spell slot of her highest level of spells for each spontaneous spellcasting class in which she has levels and to lose knowledge of one random spell known of that level (or the next lowest level if she has already lost knowledge of all spells known of that level, and so on). The target cannot use the lost spell slots and spells known as long as the corresponding negative levels last. When the target loses a spell known, the spell remains on her class list but she cannot prepare or cast the spell.  
  
If the negative levels from *mindwipe* cause the target’s total number of negative levels to equal or exceed her character level, instead of dying, she enters a catatonic state as long as the negative levels from *mindwipe* continue to cause her total number of negative levels to equal or exceed her character level.
