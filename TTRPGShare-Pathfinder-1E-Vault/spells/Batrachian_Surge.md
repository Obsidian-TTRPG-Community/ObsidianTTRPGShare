**Gills**: Your throat expands, and gill slits appear along your neck. You can breathe underwater.  
  
**Leaping**: Your legs elongate and become especially muscular. You are always treated as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump, and you gain a competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump equal to your caster level.  
  
**Swimming**: You grow a large tadpole tail, and your other limbs shrink slightly. You gain a swim speed equal to your base land speed.  
  
**Tongue**: Your tongue extends to the length of your body. Increase your reach by 5 feet when delivering touch spells. This increased reach doesnâ€™t stack with any other spells or abilities that affect your reach.
