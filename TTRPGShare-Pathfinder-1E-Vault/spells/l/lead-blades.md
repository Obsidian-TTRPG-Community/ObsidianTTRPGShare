### Description

*Lead blades* increases the momentum and density of your melee weapons just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are carrying when the spell is cast deal damage as if one size category larger than they actually are. For instance, a Medium longsword normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if benefiting from *lead blades*. Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses one of your weapons to make an attack it deals damage as normal for its size.
