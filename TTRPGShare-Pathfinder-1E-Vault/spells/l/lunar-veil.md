**duration**:: 10 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates, see text

### Description

You conjure a tremendous area of shadow to obscure moonlight within the area, creating something akin to a lunar eclipse. The light level is lowered by two steps (though unlike *deeper darkness*, areas of normal light or dimmer become normal darkness rather than supernaturally dark). Lycanthropes in the area must make a Will save every round or revert to their humanoid forms. In addition, lycanthropes attempting to assume animal or hybrid form within the affected area take a -5 penalty on Constitution checks to do so.
