### Description

You inspire yourself or a lover to a vengeful rage against a chosen enemy, who must be a creature that has wronged you in some way. If cast on you, the next time you are in combat with that enemy, you gain the benefits of a *rage* spell. If cast on a lover, he or she gains the benefits of a *rage* spell the next time the lover is in combat against your enemy. This variant of the spell must be cast within 1 hour of an intimate encounter with the target. The *rage* effect lasts 1 round per level. If the creature that triggers the *rage* effect is one of your lovers or ex-lovers, the benefits granted by the rage spell double. This spell counts as a *contingency* spell on the target for the purpose of multiple contingent effects. Worshipers of Calistria are fond of using this spell, and many keep the effect running whenever possible.
