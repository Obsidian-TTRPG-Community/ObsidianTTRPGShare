### Description

A *limited wish* lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a *limited wish* can do any of the following things.

-   Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
-   Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
-   Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
-   Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
-   Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as or *insanity*.
-   Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -7 penalty on its next saving throw.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a *limited wish* spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).

## Mythic Limited Wish

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 100  
When using *mythic limited wish* to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you’re a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you’re a caster who prepares spells). If you don’t know or haven’t prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled *mythic limited wish*, even if you’re helpless or couldn’t otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).
