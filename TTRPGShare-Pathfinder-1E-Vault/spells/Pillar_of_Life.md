### Description 

You conjure a pillar of positive energy in a single 5-foot square within range that radiates light as if it were a sunrod. Living creatures adjacent to the pillar can spend a standard action to touch the pillar and heal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Creatures can move into the square containing the pillar, but if an undead creature moves into the pillar it takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Undead creatures vulnerable to bright light take 1d8 points if damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A creature cannot benefit or suffer more than once from a single casting of this spell.

## Mythic Pillar of Life

The damage healed increases to 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The damage dealt to undead increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), or 2d6 points of damage per caster level for undead vulnerable to bright light (maximum 20d6). If a dead creature is brought into the pillarâ€™s square and that creature could be revived by *breath of life*, the *pillar of life* ends and the creature returns to life as per *breath of life*.
