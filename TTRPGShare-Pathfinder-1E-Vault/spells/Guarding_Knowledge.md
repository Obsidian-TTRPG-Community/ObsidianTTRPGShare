### Description 

Upon casting this spell, choose a specific variety of monster (red dragon rather than dragon) and one of its special attacks that you have successfully identified with a Knowledge check or otherwise researched, such as a cockatrice’s petrification ability or a spider swarm’s poison. You gain a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against the selected special attack. The bonus does not apply to saves against other monsters’ abilities of the same name, spell-like abilities, or special attacks derived from class levels or equipment. If you use a trophy from a monster of the exact same variety as an optional material component, the bonus increases to +6.
