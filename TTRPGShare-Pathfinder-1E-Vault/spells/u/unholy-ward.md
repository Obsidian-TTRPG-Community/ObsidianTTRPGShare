This spell grants you resistance to the holy powers of good-aligned deities and their servants. You resist 10 points of damage from holy sources (divine power damage from *flame strike*, additional damage from smite evil, channeled positive energy, etc.), provided they originate from a good-aligned source or a servant of a good-aligned god. You ignore a maximum of 10 points of damage per caster level, at which point the spell ends.
