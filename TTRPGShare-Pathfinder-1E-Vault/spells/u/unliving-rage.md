### Description

This spell functions as *rage*, except it affects only undead creatures and bolsters them with necromantic energy rather than emotion. Each affected creature gains a +2 profane bonus to Strength and Charisma, a +1 profane bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian’s rage.
