### Description

This spell creates an animated replica of the target drawn from the target’s subconscious. This living memory is an animated form of the target’s negative thoughts and emotions and is intent on destroying the target entirely. The living memory appears to be an exact replica of the target creature, but upon inspection it is obviously a construct. It uses the statistics of a clockwork angel except that it has an Intelligence of 10 and does not have the clockwork trait, the enhance weapon ability, or vulnerability to electricity. If the living memory is destroyed, it vanishes entirely, including any replicas of equipment.  
  
You do not control the living memory. The living memory constantly attacks the target. The nature of the living memory causes the target to become unsettled. Roll on the following table to determine how the target acts while the living memory is in sight. If the result offers a saving throw, the DC is equal to that of this spell. The result remains in effect for as long as the living memory is in sight. If the target loses sight of the living memory and then sees it again, roll on the chart again. d% Behavior
