### Description

When a creature attempts to touch you with an attack (such as a touch attack, an unarmed strike, an attack with a natural weapon, or a grapple), it feels a field of force blocking its way. It can choose to abandon the attempt, losing its action, or to push through the ward. If it pushes through, you can trigger a wave of force against that creature. This discharges the spell, deals 1d4 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and pushes the creature back 5 feet. If the creature cannot be pushed back 5 feet (if a solid surface is directly behind it, for example), it takes 2d4 additional points of force damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the total amount of force damage the creature takes.  
  
Members of the Prophet of Kalistrade prestige class can cast this spell, even though it is not a divination or enchantment.
