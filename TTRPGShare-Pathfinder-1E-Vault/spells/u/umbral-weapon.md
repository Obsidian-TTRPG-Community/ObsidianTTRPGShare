## Umbral Weapon

**source**:: Melee Tactics Toolbox pg. 31  
**school**:: illusion (cold, shadow)
**level**:: antipaladin 2, arcanist 2, bard 2, magus 2, skald 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a pair of miniature swords)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: melee weapon touched  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

A shadowy afterimage trails behind the targeted weapon, potentially damaging foes even when the weapon misses. Once per round, when the weapon’s wielder misses a creature with the target weapon, the wielder can reroll the attack. If the reroll hits, the spell hits the targeted creature and deals 1d8 points of cold damage, plus 1 additional point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spell damages the target. If the creature successfully resists *umbral weapon*, the spell is dispelled. If not, the creature takes damage as normal.
