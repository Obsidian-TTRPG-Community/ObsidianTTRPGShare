### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You utter a dire portent, causing destiny and fate to unravel around the target. This profoundly disturbing effect causes the target to suffer a cumulative -2 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for every hero point it possesses. The target can reduce this penalty by spending hero points normally, but it takes 2d6 points of damage for each hero point spent while this spell is in effect.
