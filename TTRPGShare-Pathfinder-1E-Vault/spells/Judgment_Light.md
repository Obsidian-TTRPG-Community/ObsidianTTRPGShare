### Description 

An inquisitor may only cast this spell while she has a judgment active. When she does cast this spell, it causes one or more of the following effects based on the inquisitor’s active judgments.  
  
*Destruction*: Red light erupts from the caster. Enemies in the area take 4d8 points of damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will saving throw halves the damage and negates the shaken effect.  
  
*Healing*: Green light erupts from the caster. Allies in the area regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + the caster’s Wisdom modifier.  
  
*Justice*: Blue light erupts from the caster, revealing hidden and invisible creatures to all. The light outlines such creatures for 1 round per caster level, imposing a -20 penalty on Stealth checks on those creatures.  
  
*Piercing*: Violet light erupts from the caster, reducing the spell resistance of enemies within the burst by 5 for 1 round per caster level.  
  
*Protection*: Amber light erupts from the caster, granting allies in the burst a +2 sacred bonus to AC and CMD, and a +4 bonus to AC against critical confirmation attack rolls for 1 round per caster level.  
  
*Purity*: White light erupts from the caster, allowing each ally within the burst to attempt a saving throw against a single effect that allows a saving throw with a +2 sacred bonus on the roll.  
  
*Resiliency*: Golden light erupts from the caster, granting allies within the burst DR 3/magic or the alignment your judgment allows for 1 round per caster level.  
  
*Resistance*: Copper light erupts from the caster, granting allies within the burst resistance 5 against the energy the judgment protects the inquisitor against when she casts this spell for 1 round per caster level.  
  
*Smiting*: Silver light erupts from the caster, making allies’ weapons within the burst count as magic, the alignment her weapon is, and adamantine for purposes of overcoming damage reduction for 1 round per caster level.
