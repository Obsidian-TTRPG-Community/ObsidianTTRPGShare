### Description 

This spell functions like *death knell*, except instead of using the slain targetâ€™s life energy to enhance yourself, you use it to summon a Small fire elemental resembling a burning, howling version of the slain creature. The elemental acts immediately on your turn and otherwise behaves as if you had summoned it with *summon monster II*. The elemental remains for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the slain creature.
