### Description

You grant the targeted weapon one of the following weapon special abilities: *anarchic*, *axiomatic*, *holy*, or *unholy*. If *anarchic*, this spell has the chaos descriptor; if *axiomatic*, the law descriptor; if *holy*, the good descriptor; and if *unholy*, the evil descriptor. If the caster attempts to place a special ability on a weapon that already has that special ability, the spell fails.  
  
If a warpriest casts this spell on his sacred weapon, the duration doubles. Warpriests with unarmed strike as a sacred weapon can cast this spell on their unarmed strike.
