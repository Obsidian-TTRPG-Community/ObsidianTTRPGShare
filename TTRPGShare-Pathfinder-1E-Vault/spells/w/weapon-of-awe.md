**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless, object)

### Description

You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no saving throw. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition.  
  
You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an unarmed strike.
