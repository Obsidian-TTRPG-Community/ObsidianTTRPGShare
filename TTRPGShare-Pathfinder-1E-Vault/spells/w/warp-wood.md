## Warp Wood

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 368  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: druid 2, hunter 2, occultist 2, shaman 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description

You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.  
  
You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.  
  
Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. *Make whole*, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.  
  
You can combine multiple consecutive warp wood spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.
