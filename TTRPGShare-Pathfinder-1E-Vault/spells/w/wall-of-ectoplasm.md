### Description

You draw forth a massive veil of ectoplasm that roils with restless spirits. Immovable once formed, the *wall of ectoplasm* is 1 inch thick per caster level and covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a *wall of ectoplasm* 100 feet long and 10 feet h igh, a wall 25 feet long and 40 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion and need not be anchored, but must be created continuous and unbroken. The wall can’t include squares that have creatures within them, even if the creatures are on the Ethereal Plane. The wall exists on both the Material Plane and Ethereal Plane, and blocks ethereal and incorporeal creatures from passing through it.  
  
One side of the wall, selected by you, radiates a deeply foreboding and menacing aura from the writhing spirits within. The range of this mind-affecting fear effect is 10 feet from the wall’s surface, and creatures that are in range when the wall is created or that later approach to within 10 feet must succeed at a Will save or become shaken (or panicked if they have 4 Hit Dice or fewer) for 1 round per your caster level.  
  
Each 10-foot square of the wall has 2 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of the wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached, but if a section is destroyed, the remaining ectoplasm in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall’s overall size by one 10-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. The wall can also take the form of a sphere or hemisphere whose maximum radius is 1 foot per caster level, and that is as hard to break through as the ectoplasmic plane form.
