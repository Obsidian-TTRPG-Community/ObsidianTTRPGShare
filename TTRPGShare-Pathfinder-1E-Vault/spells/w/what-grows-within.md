### Description

By speaking the name “Xhamen-Dor,” you infuse yourself with the essence of the Inmost Blot and gain a +3 profane bonus on Will saving throws for the spell’s duration. When you prepare *what grows within* for the first time, or the first time you use it via a spell-completion or spell-trigger item, you can thereafter be targeted by Xhamen-Dor’s infected dreams ability (see page 86). As long as you are under the effects of *what grows within*, your mind-affecting spells carry this supernatural taint within them and can infect those who succumb to those effects. Whenever you successfully affect a creature with one of your mind-affecting spells (this requires the target to fail its saving throw against the spell if the spell allows a save, but automatically affects a target if the spell does not allow a saving throw), that target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against *what grows within* or it immediately becomes afflicted by a lesser version of Xhamen-Dor’s seeded infestation. This infestation does not expose the victim to Xhamen-Dor’s infectious dreams, but it can ultimately result in that creature’s transformation into one of the seeded. Each time you affect a creature with *what grows within* in this manner, the remaining duration of *what grows within* is reduced by 1 round. If you affect multiple creatures in a round, you choose the order in which they must save against the effects of *what grows within*, and reduce the spell’s remaining duration by 1 round each time one of them is affected by the infestation.  
  
*Lesser Seeded Infestation*-*save* Fortitude DC = spell’s save DC; *onset* immediate; *frequency* 1/day; *effect* 1d4 Constitution drain; *cure* none. This infestation can be cured by magic alone. A creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 by this infestation dies and rises from death in 1d4 rounds as a seeded creature (see page 90). This is an infestation effect.
