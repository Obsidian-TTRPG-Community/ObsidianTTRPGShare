## Water Shield

**source**:: Pathfinder \#24: The Final Wish pg. 61  
**school**:: evocation (acid, water)
**level**:: arcanist 4, cleric 4, druid 3, hunter 3, oracle 4, sorcerer 4, warpriest 4, wizard 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF (1 cup of water)

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)

### Description

This spell surrounds you in a spout of clear acid that aids in deflecting attacks and damages creatures that attack you in melee. The constantly upward-rushing waters grant you a measure of protecting, shielding you so you only take half damage from acid and fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.  
  
Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
