## Warp Metal

**source**:: Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 6  
**school**:: transmutation (earth)
**level**:: arcanist 4, bloodrager 4, cleric 4, druid 4, hunter 4, medium 4, occultist 4, oracle 4, psychic 4, sorcerer 4, warpriest 4, wizard 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a twisted wire)

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: 1 Small metal object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius; see text  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description

You cause metal to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a successful Strength check to open, at your option). A vehicle grinds to a halt and ceases to operate. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon imposes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.  
  
You can warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.  
  
Alternatively, you can unwarp metal (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. *Make whole*, on the other hand, does nothing to repair a warped item.  
  
You can combine multiple consecutive castings of *warp metal* to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single casting. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.
