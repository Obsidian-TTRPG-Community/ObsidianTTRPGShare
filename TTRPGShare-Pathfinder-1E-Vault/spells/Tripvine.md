### Description 

You animate a rope, vine, or similar object so that it attempts to trip any creature that comes near. The rope attacks anything in a 10-foot-square area you designate. The rope does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB is equal to your caster level +2. A tripped target that was running, jumping, or charging takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Creatures aware of the tripvine gain a +4 bonus to their CMD against it.  
  
The Green Faith created this spell, but it is now common.
