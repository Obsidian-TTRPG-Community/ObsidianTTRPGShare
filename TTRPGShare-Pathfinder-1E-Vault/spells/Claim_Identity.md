# Claim Identity 

**source**:: Spymaster's Handbook pg. 28  
**school**:: transmutation (polymorph)
**level**:: alchemist 3, antipaladin 3, arcanist 4, bard 3, druid 4, hunter 4, inquisitor 3, investigator 3, shaman 4, skald 3, sorcerer 4, witch 3, wizard 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a needle and thread)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: humanoid creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You steal the target’s face, transforming yourself into a flawless imitation of it. All of the target’s facial features, vocal cues, and identifying physical traits change, transforming it into an unremarkable member of its race and gender. You transform into a perfect likeness of the target’s true form, as if affected by *alter self*, and gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the original subject of this spell; you take no penalties on this check if the original target is of a different race, age, size, or gender.  
  
*Claim identity* prevents any other polymorph effects from restoring the target’s true face for the spell’s duration, though the target can still assume other forms or faces via magic or any natural shapechanging ability.

**school**:: transmutation (polymorph)
**level**:: alchemist 5, antipaladin 4, arcanist 6, bard 5, druid 6, hunter 6, inquisitor 5, investigator 5, shaman 6, skald 5, sorcerer 6, witch 5, wizard 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a silver needle costing 100 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: humanoid creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions as per *claim identity*, except it transforms its target into a helpless, inanimate porcelain mask for the spell’s duration. The target remains aware of everything it can see or hear while transformed. The target can’t speak or move, but can still take purely mental actions (such as casting certain spells) or be targeted by spells that affect its mind.  
  
Any creature donning this mask is transformed into a flawless imitation of the spell’s target, as if affected by *claim identity* , and reverts to its natural form upon removing the mask. Any damage dealt to the mask immediately ends this spell.
