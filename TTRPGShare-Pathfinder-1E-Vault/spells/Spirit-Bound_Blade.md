### Description 

You focus emotional energy and weave it into a shroud of hardened ectoplasm around the weapon you touch, infusing it with a ghostly glow and great power. The weapon becomes a *ghost touch* weapon, and gains one of the following additional benefits, depending on the type of emotion you infuse into the weapon. If a special ability wouldn’t apply to the chosen weapon (such as vicious on a ranged weapon), the weapon doesn’t gain that benefit.  
  
**Anger**: The weapon also gains the *vicious* special ability.  
**Dedication**: The weapon also gains the *returning* special ability.  
**Despair**: The weapon also gains the *cruel*^UE^ special ability.  
**Fear**: The weapon also gains the *menacing*^UE^ special ability.  
**Hatred**: The weapon also gains the *cunning*^UE^ special ability.  
**Jealousy**: The weapon also gains the *mimetic*^UE^ special ability.  
**Zeal**: The weapon also gains the *keen* special ability.  
  
If you are a spiritualist and the type of emotional energy you choose matches the emotional focus of your phantom, the weapon grants its wielder a +2 bonus on skill checks with both skills you gain Skill Focus in from your phantom’s emotional focus.
