### Description 

You read the psychic impressions left upon an object by emotionally or psychically charged events in the itemâ€™s history, or the information imprinted by the *charge object* or *implant false reading* spells. This spell returns the same information as the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), but gives 1 piece of information when cast and requires 1 round of concentration per additional piece of information instead of 1 minute. You must still attempt an Appraise check to see how much information you gain. You gain a +10 competence bonus on the check.
