# Prediction of Failure 

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 232  
**school**:: divination (curse, fear, mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 8, occultist 6, psychic 8, sorcerer 8, witch 8, wizard 8

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: permanent or 1 round/level (see text)  
**saving-throw**:: Will partial
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You wrack the targetâ€™s body and mind with the anguish and suffering of every bitter failure it will ever experience, rendering it permanently shaken and sickened. A successful Will save reduces the duration to 1 round per level. If the target is a spellcaster, failing this saving throw means it also gains a random minor spellblight (see *Ultimate Magic*).
