# Shadow of Doubt 

**source**:: Inner Sea Races pg. 222  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (darkness, emotion, evil, mind-affecting)
**level**:: antipaladin 4, bard 4, skald 4 (Tiefling)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature/3 levels  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will partial (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You create a shadowy aura of doubt fueled by a foe’s own inner flaws. Targets perceive all illumination as if it were one light level darker, to a minimum light level of darkness (not supernatural darkness), even on a successful saving throw.  
  
Fleeting mental shadows of regrets and anxieties distract the spell’s targets; at the start of each of their turns, they must each succeed at a Will save or be staggered for 1 round. A good-aligned target takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect; an evil-aligned target gains a +4 bonus instead.
