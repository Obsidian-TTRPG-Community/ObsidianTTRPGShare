### Description 

You suppress sounds made by the targets, granting them a +4 bonus on Stealth checks. The targets have a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components or using abilities that have audible components (such as some bardic performances). This spell does not hamper the targetsâ€™ ability to hear other sounds and provides no protection against language-dependent or sonic spells and effects.
