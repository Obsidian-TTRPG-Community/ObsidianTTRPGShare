### Description 

This spell transforms your targets into trees as per tree shape, except the targets transform into living trees that resemble their original forms. If a target is in a situation that would prove fatal to a tree created by this spell, such as off the ground or under water, the target receives a +4 bonus on its Fortitude save.  
  
If the spell succeeds, the target must also attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the creature loses the ability to observe what transpires around it, and its mental capacity reverts to that of a tree, rendering it unable to take any kind of action. A target that succeeds at the saving throw can observe the area around it but can’t take any actions other than communicate to those under the effects of a speak with plants spell or to other trees. Over the span of 1 year, the target’s appearance becomes more like a common tree and less like its original form.  
  
Any polymorph effects on a target are automatically dispelled when the target fails to resist the effects of *rival’s weald*, and as long as *rival’s weald* remains in effect, the target cannot use other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form. Incorporeal, gaseous, and plant creatures are immune to *rival’s weald*.
