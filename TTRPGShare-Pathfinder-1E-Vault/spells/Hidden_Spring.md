### Description 

You spend 1 hour in quiet meditation, holding the focus component in both hands and walking around a natural area. You are simultaneously drawn to areas of natural moisture while drawing that moisture closer. As the spellâ€™s casting time concludes, you thrust the focus component into the ground. From that point, a fresh, clean water trickles forth at a rate of 1 gallon every 10 minutes. You cannot cast this spell inside a building or in an area of worked stone, but you can cast it underground. You cannot cast this spell within 1 mile of an existing *hidden spring*.
