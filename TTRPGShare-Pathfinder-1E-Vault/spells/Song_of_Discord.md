# Song of Discord 

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 345  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (mind-affecting, sonic)
**level**:: bard 5, psychic 5, skald 5

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**area**:: creatures within a 20-ft.-radius spread  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced by a *song of discord* to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.

### Description 

This spell functions as *song of discord* except that affected creatures automatically attack the nearest target each round. In addition, all affected creatures gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength for the duration of the spell. A creature that succeeds at the Will save reduces the effectâ€™s duration to 1 round.
