### Description 

You inflict a curse similar to the spell burn spellblight (*Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 97*) on a creature. Each time a spellcaster who is afflicted with this curse casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin seems to burn as though she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level of the spell cast or spell-like ability used), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she loses the spell or spell slot and is staggered for a round.  
  
Unlike with the spell burn spellblight, the burning sensation is a tangible effect, visible during the act of spellcasting as an incorporeal, violet flame surrounding the caster.
