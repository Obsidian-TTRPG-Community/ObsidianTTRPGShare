### Description 

You create a crackling lash of unholy lightning that flickers and flashes in your hand like a whip, shifting color in response to your mood and will. Once per round, you can make a melee touch attack with the *lightning lash* against a target within 15 feet. If the attack is successful, it deals 1d6 points of electricity damage and 1d6 points of damage from divine power (similar to *flame strike*), and allows you to attempt a trip combat maneuver check as a free action against your target (using your caster level as your CMB).
