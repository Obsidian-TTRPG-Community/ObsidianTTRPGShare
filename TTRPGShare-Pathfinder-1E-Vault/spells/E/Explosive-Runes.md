### Description 

You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The *explosive runes* detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the *explosive runes* (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the *explosive runes* is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the *explosive runes* were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).  
  
You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the *explosive runes*. Likewise, you can remove the *explosive runes* whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful *dispel magic* or *erase* spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the *explosive runes* and failing to do so triggers the explosion.  
  
Magic traps such as *explosive runes* are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart *explosive runes*. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for *explosive runes*.
