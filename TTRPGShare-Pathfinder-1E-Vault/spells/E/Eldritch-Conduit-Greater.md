### Description 

This spell functions like *eldritch conduit* save for the differences listed above and that the target must be within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) in order for you to use the conduit. Using a creature as a conduit for a spell ends the greater eldritch conduit effect on that creature, but does not end the effect for other eldritch conduits.
