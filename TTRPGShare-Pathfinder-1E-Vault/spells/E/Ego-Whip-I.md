**level**:: psychic 3

### Casting

**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will partial
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You can use your psychic power to overwhelm the target’s ego, leaving the target feeling hopeless and unsure of itself. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. The target takes a -2 penalty to that ability score, and is also staggered for the first round it’s affected. A successful Will save negates the staggered effect and reduces the duration of the penalty to 1 round.
