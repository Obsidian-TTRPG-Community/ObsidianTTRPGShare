# Create Pit 

**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 213  
**school**:: conjuration (creation)
**level**:: arcanist 2, sorcerer 2, summoner 2, summoner (unchained) 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (miniature shovel costing 10 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**effect**:: 10-ft.-by-10-ft. hole, 10 ft. deep/2 levels  
**duration**:: 1 round + 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex negates
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

You create a 10-foot-by-10-foot extradimensional hole with a depth of 10 feet per two caster levels (maximum 30 feet). You must create the pit on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling into it. In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect.  
  
Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. The pit’s coarse stone walls have a Climb DC of 25. When the duration of the spell ends, creatures within the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the surface over the course of a single round.

# Acid Pit 

**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 204  
**school**:: conjuration (creation) (acid)
**level**:: arcanist 4, sorcerer 4, summoner 4, summoner (unchained) 4, wizard 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (drop of acid), F (Fine shovel worth 10 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**effect**:: 10-ft.-by-10-ft. hole, 10 ft. deep/2 levels  
**duration**:: 1 round + 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex negates, see text
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

This spell functions as *create pit*, except that it places a 5-foot-deep pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact with the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may be harmed. Refer to Table 9-2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks (*Core Rulebook* 216). Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition. Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how they became broken) must make a Fortitude saving throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed. The walls of the pit are quite slippery and have a Climb DC of 30.

### Description 

This spell functions as *create pit*, except that the pit has the ability to squeeze and crush any creature trapped within it and has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the hole take falling damage as normal. In addition, anyone within the pit, not just those on the bottom, takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round as the pit contracts and then returns to its normal size (a successful Reflex save halves this damage). The ever-shifting walls of the pit are quite difficult to scale and have a Climb DC of 35.

For those willing to accept the damage incurred while climbing, the pit’s walls have a Climb DC of 20.

# Walk the Plank 

**source**:: Villain Codex pg. 188  
**school**:: conjuration (creation)
**level**:: arcanist 5, sorcerer 5, summoner 5, summoner (unchained) 5, wizard 5

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a shark tooth and a splinter of a ship's hull)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**effect**:: 20-ft.-by-20-ft. hole, 10 ft. deep/4 levels  
**duration**:: 1 round plus 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex negates (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

This spell functions as per *create pit*^APG^, except as noted here. All but the top 10 feet of the hole is filled with saltwater, reducing the fall damage for anyone falling into the pit to 1d3 points of nonlethal damage and allowing Huge or larger creatures at the water’s surface to simply pull themselves out of the pit as part of a normal move action, without a Climb check. Additionally, the pit contains a single advanced shark (*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary* 294, 247) for every 4 caster levels you have (maximum four advanced sharks). If desired, when you cast the spell, you can substitute two of the summoned sharks for one great white shark (*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary* 4 241). These sharks immediately attack any creature that falls into the pit, even you. If multiple creatures fall in the pit, the sharks attack randomly. When the spell ends, creatures inside the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit, as normal for *create pit*, but the conjured water and sharks vanish.
