### Description 

Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful melee touch attack.  
  
A paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become sickened (Fortitude negates). A *neutralize poison* spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench. This is a poison effect.
