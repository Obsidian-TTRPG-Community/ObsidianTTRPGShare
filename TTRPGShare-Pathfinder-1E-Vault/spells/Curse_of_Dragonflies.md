### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a paper insect)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: permanent (D)

**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You invest a target with cursed elemental energy, making the open skies anathema to it. If the affected creature ever tries to fly more than 5 feet above the ground, paper insects erupt from the air around the creature to interfere with its movement. The affected creatureâ€™s flight maneuverability decreases by one step for every 3 caster levels you have. A creature whose maneuverability would be brought below clumsy must land at the end of its turn each round or fall.  
  
This spell does not affect incorporeal creatures or creatures that are otherwise intangible (such as a wizard using *gaseous form* to fly).
