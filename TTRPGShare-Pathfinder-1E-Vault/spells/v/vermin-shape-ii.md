## Mythic Vermin Shape II

**source**:: Mythic Origins pg. 13  
Each *mythic vermin shape* spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic *vermin shape* spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know a lower-level *mythic vermin shape* spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn *mythic vermin shape II* if you know *vermin shape II*, even if you don’t know *mythic vermin shape I*). Each *mythic vermin shape* spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.  
  
The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0), and the resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects increases by 2. Choose one natural attack type the vermin form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4).  
  
**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round a number of times equal to your tier. For example, if you are 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of *mythic vermin shape*.
