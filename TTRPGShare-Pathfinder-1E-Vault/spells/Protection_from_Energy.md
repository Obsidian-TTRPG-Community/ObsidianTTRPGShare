**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 10 min./level or until discharged  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

*Protection from energy* grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.  
  
*Protection from energy* overlaps (and does not stack with) *resist energy*. If a character is warded by *protection from energy* and *resist energy*, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.

### Description 

This spell functions like *protection from energy*, except you divide the duration in 10-minute intervals among the creatures touched. Once the spell absorbs 12 points of energy damage per caster level (maximum 120 points) for a subject, the spellâ€™s effects end for that subject.
