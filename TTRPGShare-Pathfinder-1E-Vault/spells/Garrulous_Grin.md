### Description 

This Nidalese spell plants a seed of supernatural fear deep in a subject’s mind, causing self-doubt, stuttering, and evasiveness. Affected creatures have difficulty meeting anyone’s gaze and seem dishonest or guilty. The target takes a -4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to convince another of the truth of her words, and on Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to influence another creature’s attitude.
