# Steam Ray Fusillade 

**source**:: Aquatic Adventures pg. 61  
**school**:: evocation (fire, water)
**level**:: arcanist 7, sorcerer 7, wizard 7

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a scraping from a hydrothermal vent)

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level

### Description 

For the duration of the spell, you can fire three rays of steam once per round as a standard action (and you also fire three such rays as part of casting the spell). These rays function similarly to the rays from *scorching ray* (you can fire them at close range, theyâ€™re ranged touch attacks, they deal 4d6 points of fire damage each, and spell resistance negates them) except that they work both underwater and above water without a caster level check for being a fire spell.
