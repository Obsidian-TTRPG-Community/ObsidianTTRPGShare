### Description 

This spell protects you (but not your gear) from a natural occurrence or condition (not against a spell or the action of a creature) that would kill you. You must specify the condition, and the spell is effective only against that condition. If you are subjected to that condition during the duration of the spell, you feel no discomfort and take no damage from the condition. At the end of the spellâ€™s duration, the condition has full normal effects if you are still subjected to it.
