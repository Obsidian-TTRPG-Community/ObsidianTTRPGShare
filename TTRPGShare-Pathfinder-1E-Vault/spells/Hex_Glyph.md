# Hex Glyph 

**source**:: Advanced Class Guide pg. 184  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: shaman 3, witch 3

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: or Area object touched or up to 5 sq. ft./level  
**duration**:: permanent until discharged (D)  
**saving-throw**:: see text
**spell-resistance**:: no (object) and yes (see text)

### Description 

This spell functions like the spell glyph version of *glyph of warding*, except you can store a hex you know (but not a major hex or a grand hex) instead of a spell. If the hex has a target, it targets the intruder. If the hex has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. The triggered hex uses this spellâ€™s caster level and DC.  
  
*Read magic* allows its caster to identify a *hex glyph* with a successful DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and indicates that it stores a hex, but does not indicate the effect of that hex.
