### Description 

This spell functions as *summon swarm*, except that living and undead creatures that fail their saving throw against the swarmâ€™s distraction find that their limbs twist and spasm, as their bodies become susceptible to transmutations. Such creatures take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and on saving throws against transmutation effects for 1 hour per caster level.
