### Description 

A sheer wall of flame appears and rushes away from you. Tendrils of fire reach out of it, shaped into skulls screaming in agony. When the wall passes through a creatureâ€™s space, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 5d8). Any creature taking fire damage must also succeed at a Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Deaf creatures receive a +4 circumstance bonus on their Will saves.  
  
If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a creature takes 1d6 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.
