### Description 

You may only cast this spell if you currently have a familiar. You place your soul into the body of your familiar, and your familiar’s soul is placed in your body. This functions as if you possessed your familiar using *magic jar*; your familiar simultaneously possesses your body in the same manner. You can’t freely transfer your soul between your body and your familiar’s-if you choose to return to your body as a standard action, the spell ends. If either body is killed, both spirits return to their original bodies, the spell ends, and the original owner of the slain body dies.
