### Description

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A *spider climbing* creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

## Mythic Spider Climb

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 109  
The target gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed or 30 feet, whichever is higher. The target can take the run action while climbing and needs only one hand free to climb.  
  
The target can move freely across spider webs (including giant spider webs), *web* spells, and similar adhesives of 2nd level or less (including tanglefoot bags) as if it were using *freedom of movement*.
