## Spontaneous Immolation

**source**:: Ultimate Combat pg. 245, Orcs of Golarion pg. 28  
**school**:: evocation (fire)
**level**:: arcanist 2, psychic 2, sorcerer 2, wizard 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (pinch of saltpeter)

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude half and Reflex (see description)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You point your finger at a creature, causing it to spontaneously burst into flame. The target takes 3d6 points of fire damage and catches on fire. A successful Fortitude save reduces this damage by half and prevents the target from catching on fire. Each round on your turn, a burning target can attempt a new save to extinguish the flames (DC equal to the DC of the spell); otherwise it takes another 1d6 fire damage.
