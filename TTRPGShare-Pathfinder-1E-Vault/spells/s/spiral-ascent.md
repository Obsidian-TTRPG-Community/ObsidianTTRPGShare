### Description

You transform yourself into a helical beam of divine energy that instantly transports you upward to a spot within range. The destination must be a square in the spell’s range that’s within 10 feet of a point directly above you. The destination must be within your line of sight or familiar to you. After using this spell, you can’t take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load.  
  
If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you are teleported to a random open space on a suitable surface within the range and other limitations of the spell. If no such space is available, the spell simply fails. This spell does not function on a plane lacking gravity. On a plane with subjective directional gravity, you can use this spell to teleport in any direction.
