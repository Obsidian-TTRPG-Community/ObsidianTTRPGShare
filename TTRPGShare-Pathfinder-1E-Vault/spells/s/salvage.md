### Description

An invisible force pulls together the remains of a shipwreck. Bits of hull, tattered sails, broken masts, and smashed figureheads knit themselves back together. Rotten wood turns solid once more, and sails re-weave themselves as the rigging snakes across the masts.  
  
It takes a variable amount of time for the ship to rebuild itself, depending on its size.

|--------------|--------------|
| **Size**     | **duration**:: |
| Raft         | 1 minute     |
| Rowboat      | 1 minute     |
| Keelboat     | 10 minutes   |
| Longship     | 1 hour       |
| Sailing ship | 2 hours      |
| Warship      | 3 hours      |
| Galleon      | 4 hours      |

  
At the end of the duration, an air bubble forms around the repaired ship. If submerged, the ship shoots to the surface, erupting with a great splash before settling on the water.  
  
Though the spell requires time to repair the ship, its effects are instantaneous. A *salvaged* ship cannot be dispelled to return it to a shipwreck. However, before the spell’s duration ends and while the ship is still being repaired, *salvage* can be dispelled to interrupt the repair process. The ship remains in the condition it was in when the spell was interrupted until a new *salvage* spell is cast (but continues to age normally and suffers the effects of its environments). A new *salvage* spell’s duration is modified by any repairs already begun.
