## See Through Stone

**source**:: Dwarves of Golarion pg. 25  
**school**:: divination
**level**:: druid 4, hunter 3, ranger 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)

### Description

You gain the ability to see through solid rock as if it were transparent glass. You may see through 1 foot of stone per caster level. You see within the stone as if you were looking at the area in normal light, even if there is no illumination, though low-light vision and darkvision have no effect on your ability to see through stone. Metal at least 1 inch thick or wood or dirt at least 3 feet thick blocks your vision.  
  
The spell does not negate concealment for those creatures hiding behind stone objects (the stone is still an obstacle to your attacks).
