## Sessile Spirit

**source**:: Occult Adventures pg. 185

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature or object (see text)  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You reach into the target creature and cause that spirits within to become dormant and inactive. If the target is a medium with a spirit inhabiting its body or a spiritualist with a phantom inhabiting its consciousness (or a member of another class using the spirit or phantom class features), a failed save renders that spirit or phantom powerless, suppressing any benefits the spirit or phantom normally provides to its host, including bonus feats and spells known.  
  
If a spirit within the target is a creature using a possession effect, including *possess object*, *possession*, or a ghost’s malevolence, the spell targets the possessing creature rather than the creature it inhabits. On a failed save, the possessing spirit isn’t exorcised from the target but is dazed for the duration of the spell.
