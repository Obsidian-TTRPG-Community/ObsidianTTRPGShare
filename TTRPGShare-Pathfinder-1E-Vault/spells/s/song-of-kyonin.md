### Description

Certain elven bards of Kyonin are known for the restorative power of their performances-mostly as a result of this spell. You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell (although this spell is called *song of Kyonin*, the bardic performance need not be singing). As long as that performance continues, up to 3 creatures affected by the performance gain fast healing 2. When this bardic performance ends or you change to a different bardic performance, the fast healing granted by this spell ends as well, but all creatures affected by this spell heal 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) and are cured of any of the following conditions: exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, paralyzed, sickened, or stunned.
