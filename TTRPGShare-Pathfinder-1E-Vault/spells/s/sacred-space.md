## Sacred Space

**source**:: Advanced Race Guide pg. 89  
**school**:: evocation (good)
**level**:: cleric 2, oracle 2, paladin 2, warpriest 2 (aasimar)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a vial of ambrosia)

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**area**:: 20-ft.-radius emanation  
**duration**:: 2 hours/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

This spell sanctifies an area with heavenly power. The DC to resist spells or spell-like abilities with the good descriptor or channeled energy that damages evil outsiders (as when using Alignment Channel) increases by +2. In addition, evil outsiders take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and they cannot be called or summoned into a *sacred space*. If the *sacred space* contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or good-aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled. You cannot cast *sacred space* in an area with a permanent fixture dedicated to a deity other than yours.
