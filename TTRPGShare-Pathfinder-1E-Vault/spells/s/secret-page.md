### Description

*Secret page* alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. *Explosive runes* or *sepia snake sigil* can be cast upon the *secret page*.  
  
A *comprehend languages* spell alone cannot reveal a *secret page*'s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return it to its *secret page* form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A *detect magic* spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. *True seeing* reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with *comprehend languages*. A *secret page* spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an *erase* spell.
