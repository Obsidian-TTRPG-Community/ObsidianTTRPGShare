## Sunstalker

**source**:: Adventurer's Guide pg. 17  
**school**:: illusion (glamer)
**level**:: arcanist 3, bard 3, hunter 3, ranger 3, skald 3, sorcerer 3, wizard 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

A touched creature becomes invisible (as per *invisibility*) as long as it is in direct sunlight (or bright light shed by a *daylight* spell). If an action the target creature takes causes the invisible creature to become visible but does not end the *sunstalker* spell’s duration, the creature can use this spell’s magic to become invisible again as a standard action as long as it stands in an area of sunlight (as defined above). The creature gains only concealment (20% miss chance) in normal light.
