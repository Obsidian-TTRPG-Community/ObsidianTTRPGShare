### Description

This spell functions like *symbol of death*, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the *symbol of sleep* instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes. Unlike with the *sleep* spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.  
  
Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of sleep* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of sleep* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of sleep* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a *symbol of sleep* and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for *symbol of sleep*.
