## Saddle Surge

**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 240  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: paladin 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you and your mount  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D); see text

### Description

You and your mount form a perfect synergy that endows both of you with advantages based upon how far you travel each round. For every 5 feet your mount moves in a given round, you gain a +1 competence bonus on Ride checks and both you and your mount gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls made with weapons or natural attacks for 1 round. For instance, if your mount traveled 40 feet in a round, you would gain a +8 bonus on Ride checks and you and your mount would both gain a +8 bonus on damage rolls for 1 round, to a maximum bonus equal to your caster level. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your mount, the spell immediately ends.
