### Description

This spell functions like *symbol of death*, except that all creatures within the radius of a *symbol of distraction* instead become fascinated by the symbol for 10 minutes per caster level. Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of distraction* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of distraction* simply remains active for a duration of 10 minutes × your caster level. All fascinated creatures move toward the *symbol of distraction*, trying to remain within the symbol’s area of effect. If the symbol leads affected creatures into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature can attempt an additional Will saving throw, with success indicating it is no longer fascinated. If a creature’s view of the symbol is completely blocked, it is immediately freed of the symbol’s effect.
