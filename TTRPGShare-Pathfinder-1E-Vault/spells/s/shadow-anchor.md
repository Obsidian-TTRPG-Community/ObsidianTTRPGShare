## Shadow Anchor

**source**:: Advanced Race Guide pg. 211  
**school**:: illusion (shadow) (shadow)
**level**:: arcanist 2, bard 2, mesmerist 2, psychic 2, redmantisassassin 2, skald 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2 (wayang)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**effect**:: a shadowy shadow tether  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D); see text  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

The target’s shadow becomes a flexible tether to its current square. The creature can move up to 5 feet from that square without penalty. Moving farther than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to make a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMB of 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a bard or sorcerer). The target takes a -1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target’s move is wasted and it cannot move farther away. If it fails this check by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet toward the tether square and is knocked prone. If it beats the check by 10 or more, the spell ends. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. If the target uses a teleportation effect or leaves the current plane, the spell ends.

Add your tier to the CMD of the shadow tether. A creature attempting to escape the shadow tether using planar travel or teleportation must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted to the Plane of Shadow instead of its intended destination, as if it had cast *shadow walk* (if the target could not reach the Shadow Plane from its current location using shadow walk, this aspect of the spell has no effect).
