**level**:: arcanist 1, bard 1, cleric 1, hunter 1, inquisitor 1, oracle 1, ranger 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, warpriest 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 10 min./level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)

### Description

This spell functions as *tongues*, except the creature touched gains only the ability to speak and understand a regional human language, such as Varisian or Common (Taldane in the Inner Sea region or Tien in Tian Xia), and the language granted must be one you know. You must select the language at the time of casting. The language can’t be a dead language, such as Ancient Osiriani or Jistka.  
  
The target speaks the language with a native accent, but the spell doesn’t impart knowledge about any culture associated with the language, nor does it change the target’s appearance.
