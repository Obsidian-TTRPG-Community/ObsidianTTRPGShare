## Seeds of Influence

**source**:: Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 62  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (emotion, mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 4, bard 3, medium 3, mesmerist 3, psychic 4, skald 3, sorcerer 4, witch 4, wizard 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: S, M (a rose)

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You leave a magical trace in the mind of a creature with an attitude of at least indifferent toward you. The target takes a cumulative -2 penalty on its Will save to negate the spell for each step by which its attitude is better than indifferent.  
  
The target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against divination spells you cast. You can target that creature with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than *seeds of influence* as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the modified spell doesn’t take longer to cast and doesn’t use a higher-level spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast, *seeds of influence* ends for that target. A creature can be subject to only one *seeds of influence* spell at a time; later castings of *seeds of influence* remove any previous casting.
