### Description

An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A *slowed* creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.  
  
Multiple *slow* effects don't stack. *Slow* counters and dispels *haste*.

## Mythic Slow

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 109  
The penalty on attack rolls, on Reflex saves, and to AC increases to -2, and affected creatures move at one-fourth speed. Select one affected creature; this creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.
