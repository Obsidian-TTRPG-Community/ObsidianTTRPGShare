## Sealed Life

**source**:: Occult Adventures pg. 185  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: medium 2, spiritualist 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature

**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You seal the life force within the target, preventing it from sharing its vitality with others. Affected creatures can’t transfer damage to or from another, such as through *shield other*, a spiritualist’s life bond, or a summoner’s life link. Effects such as *vampiric touch* that steal vitality from others deal damage normally, but provide no benefits.
