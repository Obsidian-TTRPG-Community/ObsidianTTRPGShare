### Description

This spell functions like *symbol of death*, except that all creatures within the radius of the *symbol of insanity* instead become permanently insane (as the *insanity* spell).  
  
Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of insanity* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of insanity* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of insanity* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a *symbol of insanity* and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for *symbol of insanity*.
