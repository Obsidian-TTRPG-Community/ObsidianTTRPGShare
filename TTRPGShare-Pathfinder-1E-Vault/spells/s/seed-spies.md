### Description

This spell functions as *insect spies*, except it creates wafting seeds with magical intellect instead of insects. The seeds can hear but not see. They fly at a speed of 10 feet (good maneuverability), but they can’t crawl or climb, although they can cling to rough, soft, or sticky creatures or surfaces.
