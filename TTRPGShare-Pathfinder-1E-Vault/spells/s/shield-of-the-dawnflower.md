### Description

You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination as if it were a *continual flame* spell. You can only have one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as *fire shield*.

## Mythic Shield of the Dawnflower

**source**:: Mythic Origins pg. 13  
The disk of sunlight protects you as a buckler with a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels (maximum +5).  
  
You can make a melee touch attack with your *shield of the Dawnflower* in place of a normal attack to deal its fire damage to a creature. Creatures taking damage from your shield catch on fire (Reflex negates); the save DC to extinguish the fire is equal to the DC of the spell.
