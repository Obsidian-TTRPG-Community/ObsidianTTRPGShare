## Spell Absorption

**source**:: Inner Sea Magic pg. 61  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: arcanist 5, sorcerer 5, wizard 5

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S, M (a prism)

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level

### Description

If you successfully counterspell a 3rd-level or lower level spell (through either *dispel magic* or normal means) while *spell absorption* is in effect, you absorb the countered spell and use it to regain spells you have already cast. If you’re a wizard, you regain the use of any single spell that you have cast since the last time you prepared spells. If you’re a sorcerer, you regain a single spell slot. The spell recovered or spell slot regained must be of an equal level or lower than the spell you counterspelled.
