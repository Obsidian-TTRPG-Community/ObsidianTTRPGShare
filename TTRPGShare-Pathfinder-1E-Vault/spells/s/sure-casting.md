## Sure Casting

**source**:: Pathfinder Society Primer pg. 13  
**school**:: divination
**level**:: arcanist 1, bard 1, cleric 1, inquisitor 1, oracle 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, warpriest 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, F (a square of cloth and a needle)

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round (see text)

### Description

You gain temporary insight into your enemies’ magical defenses. When you next cast a spell before the end of the next round, treat your caster level as 5 higher than normal for the purpose of overcoming spell resistance. This bonus doesn’t increase any other effects that depend on caster level, such as the spell’s damage or range, and affects only the first spell cast after *sure casting*.
