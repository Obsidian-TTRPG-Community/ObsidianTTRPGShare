### Description

Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). When delivering the jolt, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor (or is carrying a metal weapon or is made of metal).

## Mythic Shocking Grasp

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 108  
The spell’s damage increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d8). If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you may attempt a free grapple combat maneuver against the target.  
  
Alternatively, if the target is carrying a metal weapon, you may attempt a free disarm combat maneuver against that weapon. This free combat maneuver doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power and the free grapple or disarm combat maneuver is successful, the target is staggered until your next turn. This is an electricity effect.
