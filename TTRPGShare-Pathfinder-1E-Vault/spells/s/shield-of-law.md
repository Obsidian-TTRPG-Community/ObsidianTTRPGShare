## Shield of Law

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 342  
**school**:: abjuration (lawful)
**level**:: cleric 8, oracle 8

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (a reliquary worth 500 gp)

### Effect

**range**:: 20 ft.  
**target**:: one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and slowing chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.  
  
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike *protection from chaos*, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.  
  
Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.  
  
Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as *protection from chaos* does.  
  
Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is *slowed* (Will save negates, as the *slow* spell, but against *shield of law*'s save DC).
