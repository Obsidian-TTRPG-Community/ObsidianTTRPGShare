### Description

This spell functions like *symbol of death*, except that each creature within the radius of a *symbol of pain* instead suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.  
  
Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of pain* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of pain* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of pain* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a *symbol of pain* and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for *symbol of pain*.
