**range**:: see text  
**target**:: sphere of annihilation

### Description

This spell allows remote viewing through spheres that have previously consumed some portion of the spellcaster’s body: a single digit of a finger or toe at a minimum. The caster can view and listen to events within a 20-foot radius of the associated sphere; this radius follows the sphere if the sphere moves. Unlike a true *scrying* spell, no other spells operate through the associated sphere, but *spherescry* produces no indication of its activity on the target and cannot be discovered by normal methods of magical detection.
