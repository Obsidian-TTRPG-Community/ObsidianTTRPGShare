### Description

This spell functions like *symbol of death*, except that every creature within 60 feet of a *symbol of weakness* instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.  
  
Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of weakness* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of weakness* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.  
  
*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of weakness* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a *symbol of weakness* and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for *symbol of weakness*.
