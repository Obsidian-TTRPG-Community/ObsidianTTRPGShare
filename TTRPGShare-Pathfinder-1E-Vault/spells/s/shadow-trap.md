## Shadow Trap

**source**:: Blood of Shadows pg. 31  
**school**:: illusion (shadow)
**level**:: antipaladin 1, arcanist 1, bard 1, bloodrager 1, cleric 1, mesmerist 1, occultist 1, oracle 1, psychic 1, shaman 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, warpriest 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You pin the target’s shadow to its current location, causing the target to become entangled and preventing it from moving farther than 5 feet from its original position, as if its shadow were anchored to the terrain. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action. A flying creature can only hover in place or fall while entangled in this manner. This spell automatically fails when cast on a creature that doesn’t throw a shadow, and it ends if the creature is entirely in an area with no illumination.
