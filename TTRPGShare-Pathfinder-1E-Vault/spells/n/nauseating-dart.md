### Description

You spit a poisonous stinger around the size of a quill at a creature within range, as though you had fired a dart from a blowgun. You must succeed at a ranged attack to hit your target. The stinger deals 1d2 points of piercing damage and poisons the target, causing it to become nauseated for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.
