### Description 

This spell functions like *minor image*, except it always creates an animated illusion of you presenting to a vampire a material, object, or sound that it is averse to, such as garlic, a holy symbol, or bells ringing. You specify what aversion the illusion depicts when you cast the spell. The vampire reacts to the illusion as if it were real; it can overcome the effect by succeeding at a disbelief save or a normal Will save against the illusionâ€™s DC (instead of the normal DC 25 to overcome its revulsion). The illusion is only quasireal and cannot otherwise affect creatures.
