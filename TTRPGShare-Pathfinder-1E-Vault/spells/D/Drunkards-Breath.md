This spell emanates from your mouth and functions like *stinking cloud*, except as noted above. The effect is barely visible and does not obscure vision. The nausea effect resembles that of an extreme hangover. This is a poison effect. Cayden Caileanâ€™s church uses this spell to disperse angry crowds, such as when celebrations get out of hand.
