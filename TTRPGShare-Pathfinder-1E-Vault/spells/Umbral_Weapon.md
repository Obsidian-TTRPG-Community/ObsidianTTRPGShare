### Description 

A shadowy afterimage trails behind the targeted weapon, potentially damaging foes even when the weapon misses. Once per round, when the weaponâ€™s wielder misses a creature with the target weapon, the wielder can reroll the attack. If the reroll hits, the spell hits the targeted creature and deals 1d8 points of cold damage, plus 1 additional point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spell damages the target. If the creature successfully resists *umbral weapon*, the spell is dispelled. If not, the creature takes damage as normal.
