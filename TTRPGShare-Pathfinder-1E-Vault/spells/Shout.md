### Casting

**components**:: V

### Effect 

**range**:: 30 ft.

**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude partial or Reflex negates (object); see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description 

You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save. A *shout* spell cannot penetrate a *silence* spell.

## Mythic Shout 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 108  
The duration that creatures in the area are deafened increases to 4d6 rounds, and the damage dealt increases to 5d8 points of sonic damage. The damage dealt to crystalline creatures and exposed brittle or crystalline objects increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d8). Crystalline creatures reverberate with sonic energy, taking 4 points of sonic damage on your turn for a number of rounds equal to your tier.

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (a metal or ivory horn)

### Effect 

**range**:: 60 ft.  
**area**:: cone-shaped burst  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude partial or Reflex negates (object); see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description 

This spell functions like *shout*, except that the cone deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level, maximum 20d6, against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. A creature in the area of the cone can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and the duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save. A creature holding vulnerable objects can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage to those objects.
