# Ironbloom Sprouts 

**source**:: Pathfinder \#62: Curse of the Lady's Light pg. 75  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: cleric 1, druid 1, hunter 1, oracle 1, warpriest 1 (Torag)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF, M (1 gp worth of powdered iron)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: 2d4 fresh mushrooms touched  
**duration**:: 1 day/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions like *goodberry*, except as noted above and that it transforms 2d4 mushrooms into magical ironbloom mushrooms rather than transforming common berries into magical berries. Alternatively, you may create twice as many mushrooms, but each only has the nourishment ability of a *goodberry* and not the healing properties.
