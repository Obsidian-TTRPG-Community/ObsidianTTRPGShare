# Temporary Resurrection 

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 243  
**school**:: necromancy
**level**:: arcanist 7, occultist 6, psychic 7, sorcerer 7, witch 7, wizard 7

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 500 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: dead creature touched  
**duration**:: 24 hours

### Description 

You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead (such as with *raise dead*). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric can cast *raise dead* or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with *temporary resurrection*, this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.
