## Halt Undead

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 293  
**school**:: necromancy
**level**:: arcanist 3, inquisitor 3, sorcerer 3, wizard 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic)

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: up to three undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of *hold person* on a living creature). The effect is broken if the *halted* creatures are attacked or take damage.
