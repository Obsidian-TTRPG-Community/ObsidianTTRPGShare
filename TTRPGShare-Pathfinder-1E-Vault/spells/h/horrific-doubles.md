### Description

You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as *mirror image*, except as noted.  
  
Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of *mirror image*). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock. Both additional effects are mind-affecting fear effects, and spell resistance applies against them.  
  
If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.
