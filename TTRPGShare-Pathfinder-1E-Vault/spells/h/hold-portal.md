**duration**:: 1 min./level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A *knock* spell or a successful *dispel magic* spell can negate a *hold portal* spell.  
  
Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this spell.

## Mythic Hold Portal

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 98  
The target portal can be as large as 30 square feet per caster level. A creature attempting to force open the portal must first succeed at a Will save against the spell’s DC. This is a mindaffecting effect. Failure means the creature can’t open the door while the spell is in effect.
