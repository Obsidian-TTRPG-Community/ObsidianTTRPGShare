### Description

With a single touch, you create temporary hairline fractures in a piece of stone or a creature with the earth subtype. If you cast this spell on a section of stone, you reduce its hardness to 5 and its hit points to 10/inch of thickness. If you cast this spell on a creature with the earth subtype, that creature takes a -2 penalty to AC for the spell’s duration. *Make whole* reverses this spell’s effect.
