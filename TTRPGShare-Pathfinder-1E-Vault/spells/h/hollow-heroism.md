## Hollow Heroism

### Casting

**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 10 minutes/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

This spell functions as *heroism*, except that you can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the spell’s duration ends (no save).  
  
Attempts to identify *hollow heroism* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as *heroism*.
