You create the sound of a large hunting horn, blowing up to three notes as loud as a roaring dragon. These notes can be heard up to 2 miles away in typical outdoor conditions. You can make these sounds at any point during the spell’s duration as a free action, and each sounding can be short or long, allowing you to send very simple coded messages.
