### Description

This spell functions as *greater heroism*, except that you can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the spell’s duration ends (no save), increasing to a -8 penalty against fear effects. Additionally, she takes damage equal to your caster level when you reverse the spell.  
  
Attempts to identify *greater hollow heroism* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as *greater heroism*.
