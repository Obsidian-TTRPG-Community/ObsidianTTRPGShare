### Description

You channel residual feelings of terror into the minds of creatures within the area, causing those fears to manifest when confronted with a specific object. All creatures in the area must succeed at a Will save or acquire a phobia (*Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250*) for the spell’s duration. You choose one kind of creature, object, or image within the area of the spell when it is cast that triggers the phobia. The kind of creature, object, or image that triggers the phobia must be named specifically. A creature type or subtype is not specific enough. The phobia can be cured using traditional methods of treating insanity, and spells or effects that prevent possession or mind control suppress the phobia for their duration. Each time the phobia is triggered in an affected creature, the spell’s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.
