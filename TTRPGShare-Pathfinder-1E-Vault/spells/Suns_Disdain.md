### Description 

You alter a creature so the touch of the sun is hostile to it. The cursed creature gains light blindness and is blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the *daylight* spell. The cursed creature is dazzled as long as it remains in areas of bright light, and it is treated as being particularly susceptible to sunlight for the purposes of resolving spells like *searing light*, *sunbeam*, and *sunburst*.
