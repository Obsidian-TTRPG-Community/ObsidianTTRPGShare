# Suggestion 

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 350  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (language-dependent, mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 3, bard 2, medium 2, mesmerist 2, occultist 3, psychic 2, skald 2, sorcerer 3, witch 3, wizard 3

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, M (a snake's tongue and a honeycomb)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level or until completed  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The *suggestion* must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.  
  
The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.  
  
A very reasonable *suggestion* causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or -2).

## Mythic Suggestion 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 109  
*Mythic suggestion* loses the language-dependent descriptor, and can target one or more living creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst.

# Contagious Suggestion 

**source**:: Blood of the Beast pg. 14  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (language-dependent, mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 5, bard 4, medium 4, mesmerist 4, occultist 5, psychic 5, skald 4, sorcerer 5, witch 5, wizard 5

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level or until completed (D)

### Description 

This spell functions as per *suggestion*, except the target can pass on the enchantment to other targets. The target is compelled to communicate your suggestion to another creature, forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the *suggestion* effect on the initial target isn’t negated. If a secondary target fails, it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread the *suggestion*. This spell can affect a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level. Creatures that save against this spell cannot be affected by that particular casting of *contagious suggestion* for 24 hours.

# Triggered Suggestion 

**source**:: Advanced Class Guide pg. 197  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (language-dependent, mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 4, bard 3, mesmerist 3, psychic 4, skald 3, sorcerer 4, witch 4, wizard 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, M (a snake’s tongue and a honeycomb)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 day/level or until completed  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions as *suggestion*, except you can use it only to specify a condition that triggers a special activity, and the subject does not remember that you made the suggestion. For example, you could use *triggered suggestion* on a palace guard to make him attack the king the next time he and the king are alone, and the guard would not remember the suggestion to do so until the trigger occurred.
