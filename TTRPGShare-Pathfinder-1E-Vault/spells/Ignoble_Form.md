### Description 

The target takes on the form of a half-elf from the surface world. Its skin, hair, and eyes change to match a specific human ethnicity. You can even change the targetâ€™s facial features or produce light facial hair or stubble. The target loses its darkvision, light blindness, and light sensitivity traits, if it normally has them. The target gains lowlight vision; a +3 racial bonus on a single Craft, Knowledge, Perform, or Profession skill of its choice; and both a +4 bonus on Bluff checks and a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass itself off as a half-elf.
