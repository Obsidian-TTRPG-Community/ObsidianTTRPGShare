### Description 

You call forth a fast-moving wave that batters all creatures in its path and leaves the target area flooded. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6). The wave also attempts a bull rush combat maneuver against all creatures of any size within its area of effect. Attempt a single combat maneuver check and apply the result to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush attempt doesnâ€™t provoke attacks of opportunity.  
  
The area covered by the cone remains inundated for 1 round per caster level. If cast on land, treat the area as a deep bog. If cast on water, the water level within the affected area rises by 5 feet.
