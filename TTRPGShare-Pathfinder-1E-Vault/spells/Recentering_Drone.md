### Description 

You emit a calming subsonic drone that allows the targets to temporarily refocus and restore their balance when they’re suffering from debilitating conditions. A target with the dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition ignores the penalties of those conditions for the duration of this spell. A target with one of the following conditions is treated as having the associated lesser condition for the duration of the spell, as shown by the following table.  
  

|               |                      |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **Condition** | **Lesser Condition** |
| Blinded       | Dazzled              |
| Exhausted     | Fatigued             |
| Frightened    | Shaken               |
| Nauseated     | Sickened             |

  
At the end of the spell’s duration, the targets are again subject to the appropriate penalties if the original conditions affecting the target are still in effect.
