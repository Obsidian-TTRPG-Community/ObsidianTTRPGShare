### Description 

A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a *dimensional anchor* include *astral projection*, *blink*, *dimension door*, *ethereal jaunt*, *etherealness*, *gate*, *maze*, *plane shift*, *shadow walk*, *teleport*, and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a *gate* or *teleportation circle* for the duration of the spell.  
  
A *dimensional anchor* does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, *dimensional anchor* does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
