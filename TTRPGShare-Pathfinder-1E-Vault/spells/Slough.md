**school**:: transmutation (evil)
**level**:: arcanist 5, cleric 5, occultist 4, oracle 5, psychic 5, sorcerer 5, spiritualist 4, warpriest 5, witch 5, wizard 5

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF (a pinch of dried skin flakes)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

The target takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round as its skin loosens and splits. Once it has taken 5 or more points of Constitution damage in this way, its skin falls off to reveal its musculature. The creature ceases taking Constitution damage, but takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against disease, pain effects, or poison, and on Charisma-based skill checks with the exception of Intimidate and Use Magic Device. The creatureâ€™s skin regrows rapidly-once its Constitution damage is fully healed, its skin becomes intact once again and the penalties end.
