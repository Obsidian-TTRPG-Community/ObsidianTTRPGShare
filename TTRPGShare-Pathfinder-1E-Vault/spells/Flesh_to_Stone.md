**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature

### Description 

The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells such as *deathwatch*.  
  
Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.

## Mythic Flesh to Stone 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 94  
A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is partially petrified, becoming slowed (as the *slow* spell) for a number of rounds equal to your tier. The creature can end this effect early by spending a full-round action breaking away its own petrified flesh, dealing 5d10 points of damage to itself. Any effect that removes or reverses petrification negates this partial petrification and the *slow* effect. The spell can affect objects and undead, as long as the target is primarily made of flesh or bone, such as a corpse or zombie. The spell doesn’t affect the target’s gear. If cast on a creature with equipment, the creature transforms into stone but its gear doesn’t.  
  
**Augmented (9th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any Large or smaller creature fully petrified by the spell immediately animates and follows your commands, as if you had cast *animate objects*.
