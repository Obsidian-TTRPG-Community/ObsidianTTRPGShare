**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (octopus or squid tentacle)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**area**:: 20-ft.-radius spread  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

This spell causes a field of rubbery black tentacles to appear, burrowing up from the floor and reaching for any creature in the area.  
  
Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of your turn, including the round that *black tentacles* is cast. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentacles' CMB, the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their Strength and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.  
  
If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The *black tentacles* spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that *black tentacles* succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The CMD of *black tentacles*, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.  
  
The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last.

## Mythic Black Tentacles 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 85  
Add your tier to the base attack bonus of the tentacles. The tentacles also deal an additional 2d6 points of acid damage with a successful grapple.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell creates twice as many tentacles in the same area, meaning each creature in the area is attacked twice per round. The tentacles can grapple creatures that are immune to grappling if that immunity is from a non-mythic source, but combat maneuver checks to grapple such creatures take a -5 penalty.

### Description 

This spell functions as *black tentacles*, except the tentacles blindly grasp at the targets’ eyes and ears, and tug at their hair, clothes, and equipment. Instead of grapple attempts, the tentacles attempt dirty trick combat maneuver checks (CMB = your caster level + 4 \[the tentacles’ Strength bonus\] + 1 \[the tentacles’ size bonus\]). Roll on the following table to determine the effect of a successful dirty trick combat maneuver check.

| 1-20   | Blinded. The tentacles suction over the victim’s eyes.                          |
| 21-40  | Deafened. The tentacles clap themselves around the victim’s ears.               |
