## Mythic Scorching Ash Form

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 107  
**school**:: transmutation (fire)
**level**:: alchemist 4, arcanist 4, investigator 4, redmantisassassin 4, sorcerer 4, wizard 4 (ifrit)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: S, M (a bit of gauze and a handful of ashes)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: willing corporeal creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

This spell functions like *gaseous form*, except the target becomes a visible swirl of hot ash and smoke instead of harmless translucent gas. The target gains the fire subtype. Any creature that begins its turn sharing a space with the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or suffer the effects of smoke inhalation.

### Mythic Description

The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This otherwise makes the same changes as *mythic gaseous form*.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of *scorching ash form* as a move action.
