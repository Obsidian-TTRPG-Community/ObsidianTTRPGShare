### Description

You invoke the mystical power of the moon to drive the target into a mad, bestial frenzy. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round, dropping held items as its nails and teeth elongate and sharpen. The target gains a bite attack and two claw attacks that deal damage appropriate for the creature’s size, and for the remainder of the spell’s duration the target behaves as if under simultaneous *rage* and *confusion* spells, attacking with its natural weapons in preference to other actions. During the final round of the spell’s duration, the target is again dazed as it returns to its normal state.
