### Description

*Harm* charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, *harm* deals half this amount. *Harm* cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.  
  
If used on an undead creature, *harm* acts like *heal*.

### Mythic Description

The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster level (maximum 225 points).  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell also acts as *poison*.
