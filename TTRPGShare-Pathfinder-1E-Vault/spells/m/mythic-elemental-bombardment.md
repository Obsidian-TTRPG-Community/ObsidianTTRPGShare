### Description

You summon elementals from their elemental planes and hurl them onto your enemies with great force. You must have line of effect to a point at least 60 feet above your intended targets and within the spell’s range. You can summon one greater elemental, two Huge elementals, four Large elementals, or eight Medium elementals. You aim the elementals at targets within 60 feet of each other, no more than one elemental per target.  
  
Each elemental can strike only a single target, regardless of its size. When an elemental strikes a target, it makes a single slam attack at its full attack bonus with a +4 circumstance bonus. The elemental deals damage according to the table below. The type and amount of damage dealt varies by the size and type of elemental (see the table). Some elementals inflict an additional special ability upon successfully hitting a target; these additional special abilities are detailed in the elemental’s full stat block and are denoted with an asterisk (\*). Whether or not it hits, the elemental takes bludgeoning damage according to its size. A summoned elemental acts on the same turn that it lands, starting prone in the nearest available space adjacent to its target.  
  
You must select one type of elemental to summon when casting this spell (see the table). When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type.

### Mythic Description

If you expend one use of mythic power, you can summon a combination of differently sized elementals of up to two different types, as long as their total number does not exceed the original limit. For example, you could summon one Huge air elemental and two Large fire elementals, or one Large water elemental and six Medium earth elementals.  
  
**Augmented (9th)**: If you expend three uses of mythic power, you summon twice as many elementals as normal, each with the advanced simple template.
