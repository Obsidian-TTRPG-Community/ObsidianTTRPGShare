## Magic Fang, Greater

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 309  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: druid 3, hunter 3, ranger 3, spiritualist 3, summoner 3, summoner (unchained) 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

This spell functions like *magic fang*, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.  
  
Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).  
  
*Greater magic fang* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

## Mythic Magic Fang, Greater

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 100  
This functions like *mythic magic fang*. You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to natural attacks or unarmed strikes affected by the spell: *flaming*, *frost*, *keen*, *merciful*, *shock*, or *thundering*. You must choose only one with each casting of the spell. For example, you can’t add *flaming* to a tiger’s bite and *keen* to its claws with the same casting. If the target has an Intelligence score less than 3, these abilities are always on (the target can’t activate or deactivate the effect) and it might react with fear if its attacks make noise or create visible energy.  
  
**Augmented (5th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can reduce the granted enhancement bonuses by 1 to add two of the above abilities or one of the following abilities: *flaming burst*, *icy burst*, or *shocking burst*.
