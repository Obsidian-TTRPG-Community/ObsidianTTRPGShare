## Mythic Death Knell

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 90  
**school**:: necromancy (death, evil)
**level**:: antipaladin 1, cleric 2, inquisitor 2, oracle 2, spiritualist 2, warpriest 2, witch 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: living creature touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous/10 minutes per HD of subject; see text  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to fuel your own power. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living creature that has -1 or fewer hit points. If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells. These effects last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature.

### Mythic Description

Increase the spell’s range to close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). Increase the temporary hp gained from the spell to 2d8 and the enhancement bonuses to Strength to +4, and gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time decreases to 1 immediate action, and you may target a creature that you killed on your last turn as if it were still alive; the dead target gets no save.
