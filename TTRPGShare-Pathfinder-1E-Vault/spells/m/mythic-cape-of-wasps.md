## Mythic Cape of Wasps

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 87  
**school**:: conjuration (summoning)
**level**:: druid 4, hunter 4, witch 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)

### Description

You summon a wasp swarm, which fills your space (up to 5 feet by 5 feet) but does not attack you. The dense cloud of vermin gives you partial concealment against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 points of swarm damage and poison from the wasp swarm, but is not affected by the swarm’s distraction ability. As a free action on your turn, you may have the swarm cling to you tightly, giving you a fly speed of 20 feet (poor maneuverability); when using the swarm to fly, it does not provide concealment or harm creatures that strike you. You can return the swarm to its protective shape as a free action on your turn.

### Mythic Description

The wasp swarm fills a 15-foot-by-15-foot space centered on you (or on 1 of your squares, if your space is larger than 1 square). Creatures in the area of the swarm are affected by it normally (including the swarm’s distraction ability). Add your tier to the swarm’s distraction DC.  
  
When you use the swarm to fly, it fills only your space, your fly speed is 30 feet (average maneuverability), and the swarm still provides partial concealment against ranged attacks.
