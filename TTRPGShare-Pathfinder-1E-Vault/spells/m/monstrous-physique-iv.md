**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 102  
Each *mythic monstrous physique* spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic *monstrous physique* spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know a lower-level *mythic monstrous physique* spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn *mythic monstrous physique II* if you know *monstrous physique II*, even if you don’t know *mythic monstrous physique I*). Each *mythic monstrous physique* spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.  
  
The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2 each, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 each (minimum penalty of 0). Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature.  
  
**Augmented (4th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. Additionally, you can cast this spell on other willing creatures, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature per tier.
