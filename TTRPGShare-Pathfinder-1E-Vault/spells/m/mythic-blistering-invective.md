## Mythic Blistering Invective

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 86  
**school**:: evocation (fire, language-dependent)
**level**:: alchemist 2, bard 2, inquisitor 2, investigator 2, mesmerist 2, skald 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**area**:: 30-ft. radius  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex partial, see text
**spell-resistance**:: special, see below

### Description

You unleash an insulting tirade so vicious and spiteful that enemies who hear it are physically scorched by your fury. When you cast this spell, make an Intimidate check to demoralize each enemy within 30 feet of you. Enemies that are demoralized this way take 1d10 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Spell resistance can negate the fire damage caused by this spell, but does not protect the creature from the demoralizing effect.

### Mythic Description

Enemies that are demoralized by your Intimidate check take 2d8 points of fire damage and catch fire (no saving throw). Any Reflex save attempted to extinguish the flames automatically fails as long as the creature remains demoralized by your Intimidate check.  
  
**Augmented (5th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell doesn’t have the language-dependent descriptor and you don’t take a penalty on your Intimidate check to demoralize creatures that are larger than you.
