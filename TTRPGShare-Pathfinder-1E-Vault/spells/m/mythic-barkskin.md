## Mythic Barkskin

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 85  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: alchemist 2, druid 2, hunter 2, investigator 2, ranger 2, shaman 2, summoner 2, summoner (unchained) 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: living creature touched  
**duration**:: 10 min./level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

*Barkskin* toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.  
  
The enhancement bonus provided by *barkskin* stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.

### Mythic Description

The target also gains DR/magic equal to the double the enhancement bonus the spell provides to the target’s natural armor bonus.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell grants DR/epic rather than DR/magic.
