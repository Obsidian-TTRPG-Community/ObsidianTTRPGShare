### Description

You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence. Even if the sending is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.  
  
If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the sending does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)

### Mythic Description

You can contact a number of additional creatures equal to your tier. Each creature must receive the same message, and can communicate back only to you.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can send the message to unfamiliar creatures (using the same number of creatures as non-augmented *mythic sending*). You must either describe the intended recipients in general or specific terms (such as “orcs,” “the queen of this country,” or “left-handed half-elven males”) or specify restrictions such as range, creature type, and alignment (such as “all good-aligned humanoids in the castle on the hill”). If a greater number of creatures meet your description than the maximum number you can send to, the closest ones to you receive the message.
