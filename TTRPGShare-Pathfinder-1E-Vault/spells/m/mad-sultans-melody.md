### Description

You imitate the mad cacophony created by the awful beings associated with the Outer God, Azathoth. This spell targets only creatures with the ooze type, creatures with the amorphous special ability, and non-bipedal creatures with a special association with the Outer Gods. This music draws the targets’ attention to the caster, as per the fascinate bardic performance. It affects mindless creatures despite the mindless quality typically granting immunity to mind-affecting effects, though it doesn’t ignore any other immunity to mind-affecting effects the creature might have. The caster doesn’t have to maintain the effect each round-the music continues for the duration of the spell. Creatures fascinated by *mad sultan’s melody* become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24 hours after the spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks on any of its targets for any reason (such as an attack).  
  
If you have the bardic performance class feature and the fascinate bardic performance, you can choose to use the spell’s saving throw DC or a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your levels in the class that grants you bardic performance + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. If you choose to use the latter DC, each round of the melody costs 1 round of bardic performance and it counts as an active performance for determining how many performances you can have active.  
  
This spell takes a toll on the caster. Each time you cast it, you take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), you instead take 2d6 points of sanity damage.
