### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**effect**:: ray

### Description

A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.  
  
When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as *forceful hand* or a *wall of force*, but not magical effects such as a *globe of invulnerability* or an *antimagic field*.  
  
A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.  
  
Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.

### Mythic Description

The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 60d6) plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage.  
  
A creature that succeeds at its saving throw takes 5d8 points of damage plus 1 point of Constitution damage. A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this spell is entirely disintegrated.  
  
**Augmented (7th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you fire two rays.  
  
Alternatively, you may fire only one ray, but if the target is a non-mythic creature and it fails its saving throw, it’s automatically disintegrated regardless of its current hp.
