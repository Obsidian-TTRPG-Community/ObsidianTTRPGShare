### Description

You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.

-   Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate *charm*, *geas/quest*, *suggestion*, or similar spells.
-   Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.
-   Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.
-   Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.

Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.  
  
A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream, too much wine, or another similar excuse.

### Mythic Description

You can modify an additional 5 minutes of the subject’s memory per tier. You may affect multiple memories with one casting of the spell, as long as the total number of minutes doesn’t exceed this limit. Each affected memory counts as a minimum of 5 minutes. For example, you could implant a memory of having a brief meeting with the mayor before lunch and another brief meeting just after dinner, even though the two events would have been hours apart.  
  
**Augmented (8th)**: If you expend four uses of mythic power, instead of altering the target’s memories, you alter all other creatures’ memories of the target (only the target gets a saving throw against the spell). All creatures on the same plane as the target forget his name, their relationship to him, and everything he has done; he is essentially a stranger to them. Any important acts by the target are attributed to someone else. Everyone’s memories of history are rewritten to incorporate this change. The target’s memories are unaffected. You can exclude a number of other creatures up to your tier from the effects of this spell (so they remember the truth), including yourself if you wish. Written records are unchanged unless you expend an additional six uses of mythic power when you cast the spell, and written records on other planes remain unchanged regardless.
