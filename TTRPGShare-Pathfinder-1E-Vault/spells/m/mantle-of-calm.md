## Mantle of Calm

**source**:: Advanced Class Guide pg. 186  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (emotion, mind-affecting)
**level**:: cleric 3, inquisitor 3, mesmerist 2, oracle 3, paladin 3, psychic 3, shaman 3, warpriest 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none and Will negates (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: no and yes (see text)

### Description

You surround yourself with a mantle of calm serenity. You take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells you cast. Any creature affected by a rage effect (barbarian’s rage, bloodrager’s bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, rage spell, skald’s inspired rage raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt at a Will saving throw, without the rage effect’s bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate).  
  
If you become affected by a rage effect while this spell is active, this spell immediately ends. If your rage effect comes from a skald’s raging song, then it ends only for you, and you cannot re-accept the effects of the song.
