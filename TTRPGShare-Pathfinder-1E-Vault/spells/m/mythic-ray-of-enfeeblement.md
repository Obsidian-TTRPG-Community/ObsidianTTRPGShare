### Description

A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject's Strength score cannot drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.

### Mythic Description

The Strength penalty increases to 1d8 + 1 per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If the target fails its save, it’s fatigued.
