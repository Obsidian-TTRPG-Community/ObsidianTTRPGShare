### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**duration**:: instantaneous

### Description

You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the *phantasmal killer*. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.  
  
If the subject of a *phantasmal killer* attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a *helm of telepathy*, the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.

### Mythic Description

If the target fails its Will save but succeeds at its Fortitude save, the phantasmal killer persists in the target’s mind, giving it the dazed condition until your next turn. On your next turn, the target must attempt another Fortitude save against the phantasm. Success means it takes 3d6 points of damage; failure means it dies from fear.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell can affect a living target that is immune to fear, illusions, or mind-affecting effects.
