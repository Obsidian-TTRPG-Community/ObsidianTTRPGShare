You may animate one Small or smaller object or a corresponding number of larger objects as follows: A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.  
  
This spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.  
  
*Animate objects* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

### Mythic Description

Animated objects you create with this spell get the maximum number of hit points per level, gain a +4 bonus to their Strength ability scores, and have 1-1/2 times the normal number of construction points.
