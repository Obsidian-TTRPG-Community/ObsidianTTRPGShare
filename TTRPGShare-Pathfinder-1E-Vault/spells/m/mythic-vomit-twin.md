## Mythic Vomit Twin

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 111  
**school**:: conjuration (creation, teleportation)
**level**:: alchemist 3, arcanist 4, investigator 3, magus 3, psychic 4, sorcerer 4, summoner 3, summoner (unchained) 3, wizard 4 (goblin)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**effect**:: creates one ooze duplicate of the caster  
**duration**:: 1 round/level

### Description

Upon casting this spell, you vomit forth a disgusting ooze copy of yourself into a single adjacent square. As long as the twin exists, whenever you take a move action to move, the twin can move as well, although it does not need to follow you and cannot take any other actions. On subsequent rounds, at the start of your turn, you can instantaneously exchange places with your twin, as if using *teleport*. This is not an action and does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  
  
The twin has a speed of 30 feet and provokes attacks of opportunity from movement as normal. It has an AC equal to 10 + 1/2 your caster level and a number of hit points equal to your caster level. If the twin is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, although you can create a new one on your turn as a standard action as long as the duration persists. You cannot have more than one vomit twin at a time.

### Mythic Description

Any spell you cast that has a range of touch, close, medium, or long can originate from the twin instead of you. The twin gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your tier, and has hit points equal to double your caster level. The twin can attempt attacks of opportunity using your base attack bonus, but has no ability score modifiers, skills, or feats. It threatens an area appropriate for your size and wields a copy of the weapon you were wielding when you cast *mythic vomit twin*. If the twin’s weapon is destroyed or disarmed, on your turn the twin generates a new weapon from its own substance. Its attacks deal damage using that weapon’s die type.  
  
**Augmented (5th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create two copies when you cast the spell, and both can be active at the same time. If you instead expend three uses of mythic power, you create three copies when you cast the spell, and all three can be active at the same time.
