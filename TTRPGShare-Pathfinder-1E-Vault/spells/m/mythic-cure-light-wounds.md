### Description

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

### Mythic Description

The damage cured increases to 2d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +10). The spell cures up to 1 point of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what type of ability damage is cured.
