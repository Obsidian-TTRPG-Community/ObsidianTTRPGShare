## Mythic Sacred Bond

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 106  
**school**:: conjuration (healing)
**level**:: cleric 3, inquisitor 2, oracle 3, paladin 2, warpriest 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S, F (a pair of golden bracelets worth 100 gp each worn by both you and the target)

### Effect

**range**:: touch; see text  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 10 minutes/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

To use this spell, you first touch the intended recipient, creating a sympathetic field of healing energies between you. Once the spell has been cast, you and the target may cast conjuration (healing) spells with a range of touch upon each other so long as you are within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Should either you or the target remove your bracelet, the spell immediately ends.

### Mythic Description

The range at which you and the target can cast conjuration (healing) spells on each other increases to medium (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level). When you or the target uses the *sacred bond* to cast a healing spell on the other, the caster also heals a number of hit points equal to the minimum amount the spell can heal.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, casting a healing spell through the link heals the caster the normal amount instead of the minimum amount.  
  
You and the target can use the link to heal each other with targeted healing abilities such as lay on hands. Unlike with healing spells, a character using a healing ability in this way doesn’t heal herself.
