## Mage Armor

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 306  
**school**:: conjuration (creation) (force)
**level**:: arcanist 1, bloodrager 1, occultist 1, psychic 1, sorcerer 1, spiritualist 1, summoner 1, summoner (unchained) 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (a piece of cured leather)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a *mage armor* spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.  
  
Unlike mundane armor, *mage armor* entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since *mage armor* is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

## Mythic Mage Armor

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 100  
The armor bonus increases to +6. There is a 50% chance that any critical hit or sneak attack made against the target is negated and treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing *moderate fortification armor*.
