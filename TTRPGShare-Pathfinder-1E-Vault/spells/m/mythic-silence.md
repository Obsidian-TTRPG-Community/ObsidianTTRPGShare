## Mythic Silence

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 108  
**school**:: illusion (glamer)
**level**:: antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric 2, inquisitor 2, mesmerist 2, oracle 2, psychic 2, skald 2, warpriest 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)  
**area**:: 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates; see text or none (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes; see text or no (object)

### Description

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a *silence* spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.

### Mythic Description

This spell also applies to telepathy, cutting off any mental communication within the area. At the time of casting, you can choose to be immune to your own *mythic silence* effect and can designate up to one creature per tier to also gain this immunity. Creatures immune to the *mythic silence* are subject to sonic effects as normal.
