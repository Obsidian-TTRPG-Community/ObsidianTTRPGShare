### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF (soft clay)

### Effect

**range**:: touch

**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with *stone shape*, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.

### Mythic Description

The duration changes to 1 round/level and instantaneous (see text). Each round after the round you cast the spell, you can spend a standard action to shape up to 5 additional cubic feet of stone you touch. Shaped stone has an instantaneous duration (meaning it does not revert to its previous form when the spell ends).
