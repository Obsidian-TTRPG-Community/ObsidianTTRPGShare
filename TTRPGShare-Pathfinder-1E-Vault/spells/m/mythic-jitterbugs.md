## Mythic Jitterbugs

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 99  
**school**:: illusion (figment) (mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 2, bard 1, mesmerist 1, psychic 2, redmantisassassin 2, skald 1, sorcerer 2, wizard 2 (gnome)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: short (25 ft. +5 ft. 2/levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level

### Description

You cause the target to perceive itself as being covered in creeping, crawling, stinging bugs. This causes the target to become jittery and unable to stay still, forcing it to constantly move and twitch. The target takes a -4 penalty on all Dexterity checks and Dexterity-based skill checks, and cannot take the delay, ready, or total defense actions.

### Mythic Description

Starting on the second round of the spell, the affected target must succeed at a Fortitude save on your turn or be nauseated for 1 round, as if distracted by an actual swarm.
