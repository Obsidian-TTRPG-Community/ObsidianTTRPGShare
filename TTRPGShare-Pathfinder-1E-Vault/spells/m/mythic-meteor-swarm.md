### Description

*Meteor swarm* is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to *fireball* in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.  
  
If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.  
  
Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.

### Mythic Description

The meteors created by this spell deal bludgeoning damage in a line extending from you to the target destination where it explodes. Creatures in the path of a meteor take 2d10 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. The damage from the exploding meteors increases to 6d10 points of fire damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex saves against the fire damage are also knocked prone and deafened for 1d4 rounds.  
  
**Augmented (10th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures in the path of a meteor also take 4d10 points of fire damage and the damage from the exploding meteors increases to 10d10 points of fire damage; this fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity.
