## Microcosm

**source**:: Occult Adventures pg. 176  
**school**:: illusion (phantasm) (mind-affecting)
**level**:: psychic 9

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one or more creatures  
**duration**:: permanent  
**saving-throw**:: Will partial (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You plunge the targets’ minds into a veiled immersive mindscape (see page 235) of your own design. You can affect any number of creatures whose combined total Hit Dice do not exceed 30. A creature of 10 HD or fewer gets no saving throw, one of 11-15 HD escapes after 10 minutes per level you possess on a successful save, and a creature of 16 HD or more negates the effect on a successful save. Given time, the bodies of creatures whose minds are trapped in a *microcosm* can die of starvation and thirst without care. Creatures can neither escape from nor enter a *microcosm*, even via a *mindscape door*. *Microcosm* can be ended only by *miracle* or *wish*.  
  
Creatures inside a *microcosm* can be affected by mind-affecting effects targeted against their real bodies. However, they perceive them as natural events within their inner mindscape. Multiple creatures affected by the same *microcosm* can interact with one another within the mindscape.
