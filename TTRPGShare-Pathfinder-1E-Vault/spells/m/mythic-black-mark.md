## Mythic Black Mark

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 85  
**school**:: necromancy (curse, fear)
**level**:: druid 7, witch 7 (human)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a flask of seawater)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: permanent  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark’s exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The *black mark* functions as a *mark of justice*, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the *black mark* is active, the target is affected as if subject to *nature’s exile*, but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not.

### Mythic Description

Any time the cursed creature travels on or in the water more than 1 mile from shore, each day it (or the vessel it’s on) is attacked by one or more aquatic or water monsters, as if summoned by *summon nature’s ally VII* (caster level 13th).
