## Mythic Pernicious Poison

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 103  
**school**:: necromancy (poison)
**level**:: antipaladin 2, arcanist 2, druid 2, hunter 2, occultist 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 10 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You weaken the target’s defenses against poison. The target gains a -4 penalty on saves against poison, and poisons affecting the target continue for another 2 frequency increments (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned target with skill or magic take a -4 penalty.

### Mythic Description

The number of successful saving throws needed to cure a poison increases by one. If the poison deals ability damage on a failed saving throw, that ability damage increases by 1.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target’s penalty on saves against poison increases to -8, and the penalty for attempting to cure the target with skill or magic increases to -8.  
  
If you expend three uses of mythic power, the poison bypasses the creature’s poison immunity (this doesn’t affect poison immunity from not having a Constitution score).
