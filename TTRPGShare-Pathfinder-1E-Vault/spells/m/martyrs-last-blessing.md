## Martyr's Last Blessing

**source**:: Pathfinder \#68: The Shackled Hut pg. 69  
**school**:: conjuration (healing)
**level**:: cleric 3, hunter 3, oracle 3, ranger 3, warpriest 3 (Milani)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 minute  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: personal (see text)  
**target**:: you and one ally/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart (see text)  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level or instantaneous (see text)  
**saving-throw**:: Will half (harmless, see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

You charge your body with healing energy, which erupts from you if you are dying or are killed before 1 hour per level has passed. If you’re brought below 0 hit points or killed (including by effects that kill without dealing damage, such as *phantasmal killer* and *power word kill*), the eruption of healing energy acts as *mass cure light wounds* on allies (other than you). Allies with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first. Among allies with equal HD, those closest to you are affected first. If the duration ends, the stored healing energy dissipates with no effect.
