## Mythic Memory Lapse

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 100  
**school**:: enchantment (mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 1, bard 1, mesmerist 1, occultist 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.

### Mythic Description

The target forgets an additional round, back to the beginning of the turn before its last turn.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend 1 round implanting a false memory in the affected target. This false memory is limited to events that could have occurred during the time it just forgot, as if using *modify memory* but limited to that short period of time. For example, you couldn’t implant the memory of a lengthy conversation, as that couldn’t happen in the forgotten length of time.  
  
The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to the *mythic memory lapse* DC plus your tier) to resist this implanted memory. Success means no memory is implanted, but the target still forgets the allotted time.
