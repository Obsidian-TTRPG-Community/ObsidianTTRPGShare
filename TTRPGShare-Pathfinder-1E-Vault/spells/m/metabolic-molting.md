## Metabolic Molting

**source**:: Blood of the Beast pg. 19  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: cleric 6, druid 6, hunter 6, oracle 6, shaman 6, warpriest 6, witch 6 (Nagaji)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, M (a valuable gemstone worth at least 250 gp)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: willing creature or dead body touched  
**duration**:: see text  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

You encase the willing subject in a jeweled shell that has the same hardness and hit points as 5 inches of iron (hardness 10, hp 150). For 7 days, the subject enters a state of suspended animation (as per *temporal stasis*), during which it heals from even the most grievous wounds. Each day, the subject regains 5 hit points per Hit Die it has as well as recovering from 2 points of ability damage or ability drain from any ability score of its choice. After 7 days, the shell crumbles away and the subject emerges, its body’s severed limbs, broken bones, and ruined organs regrown (as per *regenerate*).  
  
If the gemstone you use for the component is worth at least 5,000 gp, *metabolic molting* can bring a target back to life, as long as it has been dead for no more than 1 hour when the spell is cast. When the spell is used on such a creature, the creature comes back to life after 7 days and stabilizes at 0 hit points. A creature brought back to life through *metabolic molting* gains 1 permanent negative level, or 2 points of Constitution drain if it is 1st level. Like *raise dead*, this spell can’t save creatures slain by death effects.
