### Description

The warded creature gains resistance to ranged weapons. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons. This spell doesn't grant you the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.

### Mythic Description

The damage reduction increases to 15/magic. The maximum damage prevented by the spell increases to 15 points per caster level (maximum 150 points). If the spell prevents all damage from a ranged weapon attack, it turns the projectile or weapon back on the attacker, using the same attack roll result. If the attacker is also protected by *mythic protection from arrows* and its spell completely prevents the damage from the rebounded attack, the weapon or projectile is destroyed.
