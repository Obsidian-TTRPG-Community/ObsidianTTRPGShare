### Description

You invigorate your allies, who can hustle (*Core Rulebook* 170) as long as you continue to sing or chant (which requires your concentration). This movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. You can concentrate on this spell and hustle at the same time.
