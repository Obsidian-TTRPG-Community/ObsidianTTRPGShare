## Mythic Burning Gaze

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 87  
**school**:: evocation (fire)
**level**:: arcanist 2, bloodrager 2, druid 2, hunter 2, magus 2, mesmerist 2, occultist 2, shaman 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF (eye of a mundane salamander)

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.  
  
As a standard action as long as this spell’s effects persist, you may direct your *burning gaze* against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from *burning gaze*.  
  
Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack-foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze.

### Mythic Description

You may focus your burning gaze on a creature or object as a move action instead of as a standard action. The target takes 1d8 points of fire damage for failing its save and for each round it’s on fire.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, once during the spell’s duration you can, as a full-round action, direct your burning gaze at up to one creature per caster level.
