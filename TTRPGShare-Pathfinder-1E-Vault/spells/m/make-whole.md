**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one object up to 10 cu. ft./level or one construct creature of any size  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless, object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless, object)

### Description

This spell functions as *mending*, except that it repairs 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 5d6).  
  
*Make whole* can fix destroyed magic items (at 0 hit points or less), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. When *make whole* is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.

## Mythic Make Whole

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 100  
The damage the spell repairs increases to 2d6 points of damage per caster level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 10d6). A construct repaired with this spell gains a +2 enhancement bonus on an ability score of your choice for the next 24 hours. To repair a magic item, your caster level has to equal to only the caster level of the magic item, not double the caster level.
