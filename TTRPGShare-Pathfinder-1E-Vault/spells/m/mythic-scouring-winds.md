**level**:: arcanist 7, druid 7, sorcerer 7, witch 7, wizard 7

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)

### Description

This spell brings forth a windstorm of stinging sand that blocks all vision. You can move the storm up to 30 feet each round as a move action.  
  
Any creature in the area takes 3d6 points of piercing damage each round. The area is considered a windstorm (see the wind effects table).  
  
If a creature with spell resistance successfully resists this spell, it is unaffected by the winds and sand, but still unable to see within the area of the spell.

### Mythic Description

The spell’s damage increases to 4d8 points of piercing damage. Any creature in the area at the start of your turn must succeed at a Reflex save or be blinded for as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves.  
  
**Augmented (5th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the sandstorm’s radius and height each increase to 40 feet, and the damage dealt increases to 6d8 points of piercing damage. Each round, you can either move the storm up to 50 feet as a move action or up to 10 feet as a swift action.
