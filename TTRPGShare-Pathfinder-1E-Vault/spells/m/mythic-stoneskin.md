### Description

The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains DR 10/adamantine. It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

### Mythic Description

The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease, poison, and stun effects. There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against the target is treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing *medium fortification* armor.
