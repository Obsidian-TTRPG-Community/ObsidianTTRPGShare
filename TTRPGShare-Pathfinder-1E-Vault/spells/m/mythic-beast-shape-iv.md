### Mythic Description

Each *mythic beast shape* spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic *beast shape* spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order and are not required to know a lower-level *mythic beast shape* spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn *mythic beast shape II* if you know *beast shape II*, even if you don’t know *mythic beast shape I*). Each *mythic beast shape* spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.  
  
The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4).  
  
**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round. For example, if you’re 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of *mythic beast shape*.
