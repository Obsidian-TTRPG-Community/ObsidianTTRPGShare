### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none

### Description 

You test a creature’s purity of convictions by exposing it to a sheet of divine fire. Unless the target’s alignment is within one step of your deity’s, the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6 points of damage). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to firebased attacks. Additionally, if the target has an element of its alignment that is in direct opposition to your (chaos opposes law and evil opposes good), you can also attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target as a free action.
