# Sand Whirlwind 

**source**:: Taldor, Echoes of Glory pg. 25  
**school**:: conjuration (creation)
**level**:: cleric 3, oracle 3, warpriest 3

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a handful of sand, dust, or fine powder)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (blinding only)
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

A whirling cloud of sand strikes the target, blinding it and hampering its ability to speak. To speak while affected by the spell, the target must make a Concentration check (DC equal to the DC of this spell). If the target tries to cast a spell, the Concentration DC increases by the level of the spell being cast. A successful Will save negates the blindness but not the speechhampering effect.
