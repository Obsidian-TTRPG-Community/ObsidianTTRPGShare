**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You make the target an asymptomatic carrier for a host of virulent diseases. Creatures that end their turn adjacent to the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be affected as if by the spell contagion. The target itself does not become diseased, and suffers no ill effects from this spell. Once *plague bearer* ends, the target is no longer contagious, though any creature it infected remains diseased.
