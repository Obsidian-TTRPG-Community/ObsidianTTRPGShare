### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched

### Description 

This spell causes a brushy beard of stiff iron to erupt from the face of a willing target. The *ironbeard* grants a +1 armor bonus to AC, and this bonus stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The *ironbeard* may also be used as a weapon equivalent to cold iron armor spikes. The *ironbeard* makes it difficult to speak, so any spellcasting with a verbal component has a 20% spell failure chance.
