### Description 

This spell increases the effectiveness of a planned action. If the targets spend at least 1 minute studying a situation, they receive bonuses to their first actions in response to the situation. All targets must declare in advance what their intended actions are. If they perform those actions, they receive a +2 sacred bonus to AC, saving throws, and checks for the first round. This bonus increases to +4 at 10th level and +6 at 15th level.  
  
For example, the PCs discover a camp of orcs; the PC cleric casts *tactical assault*, the group spends 1 minute analyzing the layout of the camp, and then declares its actions. As long as the PCs stick to the plan, they gain a +2 morale bonus to AC, saving throws, and all actions for the first round.
