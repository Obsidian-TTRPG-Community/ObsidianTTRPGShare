### Description 

As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate skill check to make a target act friendly toward you. If you succeed, the target assists you normally, but *Egorian diplomacy* clouds the memory of any threats or pressure you applied. The target remembers assisting you, but can’t remember why, and its attitude toward you doesn’t worsen as a result of being intimidated.  
  
Whether a creature fails or succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes immune to further castings of Egorian diplomacy for 24 hours.
