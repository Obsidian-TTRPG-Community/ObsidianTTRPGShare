### Description 

You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate.  
  
The *nightmare* prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The *nightmare* leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.  
  
The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge the subject and the physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.

| \*You must have some sort of connection to a creature of which you have no knowledge. |                        |

  
*Dispel evil* cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the *nightmare* and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the *dispel evil*.  
  
If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell ends.  
  
If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.  
  
You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You always fail Reflex and Will saving throws, for example.)  
  
Creatures who don't sleep (such as outsiders) or dream are immune to this spell.

## Mythic Nightmare 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 102  
The spellâ€™s damage increases to 4d6 points of damage, and the target is also shaken for 24 hours.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: You can deliver a mind-affecting spell through a *mythic nightmare*. The maximum level of the delivered spell is equal to half your tier, and you must expend one use of mythic power for each spell level of the imbued spell in addition to the one use needed to cast *mythic nightmare*. You choose whether the delivered spell affects the creature immediately or when it awakens. The delivered spell affects only the target, even if it normally affects multiple creatures or an area.
