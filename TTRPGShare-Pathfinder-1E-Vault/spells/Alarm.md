### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F/DF (a tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**area**:: 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space  
**duration**:: 2 hours/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

*Alarm* creates a subtle ward on an area you select. Once the spell effect is in place, it thereafter sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the *alarm*. You decide at the time of casting whether the *alarm* will be mental or audible in nature.  
  
*Mental Alarm*: A mental *alarm* alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental “ping” that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A *silence* spell has no effect on a mental *alarm*.  
  
*Audible Alarm*: An audible *alarm* produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.  
  
In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a *silence* spell cannot hear the ringing.  
  
Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the *alarm*.  
  
*Alarm* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

# Escape Alarm 

**source**:: Villain Codex pg. 45  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: arcanist 2, bard 2, hunter 2, inquisitor 2, occultist 2, psychic 2, ranger 2, skald 2, sorcerer 2, spiritualist 2, summoner 2, summoner (unchained) 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F (a short segment of chain)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**area**:: ten 10-foot cubes/level  
**duration**:: 24 hours  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

You place a ward on an area that notifies you when a creature exits it. This functions as *alarm*, except as noted. It alerts you when a creature leaves, rather than enters, the area, and you can’t select a password to bypass its effects. Instead, when you place an *escape alarm*, you can attune up to one additional creature per caster level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to your own *escape alarm* and don’t count against the limit. Attuned creatures can enter and exit the spell’s area without triggering the alarm. If you select a mental alarm rather than an audible one, all attuned creatures receive the mental alert when someone exits the warded area.

# Selective Alarm 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 224  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: arcanist 3, bard 3, hunter 2, inquisitor 3, occultist 3, psychic 3, ranger 2, skald 3, sorcerer 3, spiritualist 3, summoner 3, summoner (unchained) 3, wizard 3

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, F/DF (a slender iron rod 1 foot in length)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**area**:: up to 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space  
**duration**:: 2 hours/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

This spell functions as *alarm*, except that you can tweak the spell to be more discerning in what types of creatures or objects trigger the alarm. Instead of being triggered whenever a creature of Tiny size or larger enters the warded area, you can set whatever triggering conditions you wish, as long as they are based on observable phenomenon. For example, you could cause the *selective alarm* to trigger when creatures of a certain race (such as orcs, bugbears, or kobolds) enter the area, or whenever a group of four or more creatures enters the area together, or when a metal object is brought into the area. You can’t choose triggering conditions that rely on unobservable information, such as having it triggered when creatures of a certain alignment enter the area, nor could you have the alarm be triggered by “something worth more than 5,000 gp” entering the area, or even “a weapon” entering the area, because an item’s value and classification as a weapon is subjective, and might vary from one person to the next.
