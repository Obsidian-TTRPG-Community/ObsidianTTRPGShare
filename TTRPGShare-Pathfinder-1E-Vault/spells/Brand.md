### Description 

*Brand* etches an indelible rune or mark of no more than 6 characters onto a creature, inflicting 1 point of damage. The mark may be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. A *brand* can be hidden by clothing or removed by scraping it away (causing 1d6 points of damage), though the *brand* returns if the damage is healed.

# Brand, Greater 

**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 207  
**school**:: transmutation (curse)
**level**:: inquisitor 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: permanent  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions like *brand*, except that it inflicts 1d6 points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily. In addition, a *greater brand* blazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened. Like the effects of *bestow curse*, a *greater brand* cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a *mark of justice*.
