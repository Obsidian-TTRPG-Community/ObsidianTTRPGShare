## Disable Construct

**source**:: Advanced Class Guide pg. 179  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: alchemist 3, arcanist 3, investigator 3, redmantisassassin 3, sorcerer 3, witch 3, wizard 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: construct touched  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

You can make a melee touch attack to send a pulse into the target, interfering with the magic that endows it with life. If the construct fails its saving throw, it becomes helpless, but it receives a new save each round at the end of its turn to shake off the effect. If the construct is normally immune to magic, the pulse is less effective and the construct receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw.
