### Description

*Dazzling blade* makes a weapon appear dazzlingly shiny, as if crafted from pure silver and heavily polished. In combat, the flashing movements of a *dazzling blade* become almost hypnotic. The wielder of a weapon under the effects of *dazzling blade* gains a +1 competence bonus on all Bluff checks made to feint in combat. The wielder also gains a +1 competence bonus on all CMB checks made to disarm a foe, and a +1 competence bonus to his CMD against disarm attempts made against the weapon bearing the *dazzling blade* effect. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 caster levels, to a maximum bonus of +5 at 12th level.  
  
The wielder of a *dazzling blade* can discharge the spell into a blinding burst of silvery light as a free action. The wielder selects an adjacent opponent as the focal point of this burst of light-that creature must make a Will save to avoid being blinded for 1 round (with a successful save, the creature is instead dazzled for 1 round).  
  
Despite its shiny appearance, a *dazzling blade* grants no extra benefit against creatures that are vulnerable to silver.
