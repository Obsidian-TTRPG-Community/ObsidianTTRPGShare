### Description

This spell functions as *discharge*, except it can discharge multiple technological objects and can be used to target an area.  
  
You choose to use *greater discharge* in one of two ways: an area discharge or a targeted discharge.  
  
*Area Discharge*: When *greater discharge* is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creature’s possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.  
  
*Targeted Discharge*: This spell functions as *discharge*, but if the target is a creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the target’s charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you possess.
