## Delay Pain

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 216  
**school**:: enchantment (emotion)
**level**:: arcanist 2, bard 2, bloodrager 2, cleric 2, inquisitor 2, mesmerist 2, oracle 2, psychic 2, skald 2, sorcerer 2, warpriest 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You override the target’s ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as *pain strike* and *symbol of pain*) do not affect the target until this spell’s duration has expired. This does not negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain while the spell lasts.
