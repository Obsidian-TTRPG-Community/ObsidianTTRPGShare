### Description

You create an arrow made of crackling electricity, which you may use for one of two effects.  
  
*Attack*: You may throw the arrow up to Medium range or fire it from a bow up to the bow’s maximum range. Either use is a ranged touch attack. The arrow deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point per level (maximum +5).  
  
*Beacon*: You throw or fire the arrow straight up. When it reaches maximum range or a solid surface (such as the roof of a cave) it explodes in a peal of thunder and forms a forked bolt of electricity resembling Erastil’s holy symbol, which lingers for 1 round. The thunder and lightning are as loud and bright as natural thunder and lightning, but they do not harm any nearby creatures.
