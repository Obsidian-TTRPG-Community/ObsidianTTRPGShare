### Description

You suppress magical sound-dampening effects within the area. *Disrupt silence* temporarily negates magical silence within its area, so that normal sounds can be heard within the overlapping areas of effect. Additionally, *disrupt silence* can automatically counter or dispel any magical silence effect of equal or lower level cast upon the same target, such as *silence*. If you cast *disrupt silence* on the target of a higher-level silence effect, it functions as *dispel magic* instead of its normal function.
