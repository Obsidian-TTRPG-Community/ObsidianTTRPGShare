## Delusional Pride

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 216

**level**:: arcanist 1, bard 1, medium 1, mesmerist 1, psychic 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 minute  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

The target becomes so distracted by an overblown sense of its worth that it takes a -2 penalty on attacks and skill checks. However, this feeling also gives the target a +2 morale bonus on saves against charm and compulsion effects.
