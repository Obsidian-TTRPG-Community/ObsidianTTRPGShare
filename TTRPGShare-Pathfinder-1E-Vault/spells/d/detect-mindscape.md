### Description

This spell functions similarly to *detect thoughts*, allowing you to sense when one or more creatures’ consciousnesses are inside a mindscape (see page 234). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular subject.  
  
**First Round**: You sense the presence or absence of a mindscape. At least one of the creatures inside the mindscape must be within the cone-shaped area for you to detect the mindscape.  
  
**Second Round**: You sense the number of consciousnesses inside the mindscape. Not all of the creatures within the mindscape must be standing inside the cone-shaped area of the spell for you to count them; only one is required to get this reading. However, you can’t determine the location of the creatures if you can’t see the creatures themselves. You sense their presence only in an abstract way.  
  
**Third Round**: You sense an image of what’s taking place inside the mindscape. The creature controlling the mindscape can sense your efforts, and if it does not wish you to view the mindscape, it can prevent this viewing with a successful Will save. Otherwise, you perceive the visuals remotely, as if watching through a window. If a creature has disguised itself, you see only the creature’s mental mask (not its true form).  
  
Each round, you can turn to detect mindscapes in a new area. The spell can penetrate many barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.  
  
If you are within a mindscape when you cast this spell, you become aware you’re in a mindscape. On the second round, you can still detect how many consciousnesses are inside, but you don’t get the image of the mindscape in the third round.
