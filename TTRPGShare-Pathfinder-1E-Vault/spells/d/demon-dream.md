### Effect

**range**:: unlimited

### Description

When the target of *demon* dream is a worshiper of a demon lord or Lamashtu, the caster has the option of making the spell function instead as a *dream* spell. Otherwise, this spell functions like *nightmare* (see *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 316*), save that the subject matter of the dream always involves demons. Upon waking from a *demon dream*, the victim must make a saving throw against the spell to resist taking 1d6 points of Wisdom drain from the unsettling, madness- inducing dream-this is in addition to the damage and fatigue normally caused by the *nightmare*.
