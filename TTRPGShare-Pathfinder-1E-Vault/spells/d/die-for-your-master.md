### Description

This spell functions as *bleed for your master*, but it allows your companion or familiar to intercept any attack that targets you, including those that do not require attack rolls (e.g., *chain lightning*, *hold monster*, and *magic missile*). Your companion or familiar cannot intercept effects that do not affect creatures of its type (e.g., dominate person).
