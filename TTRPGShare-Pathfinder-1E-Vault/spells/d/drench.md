### Description

A sudden downpour soaks the target creature or object. The rain follows the subject up to the range of the spell, soaking the target with water.

*Note from Jason Bulmahn*: The following spells are different from your standard cantrips. They are rare cantrips. Spellcasters that gain access to all 0-level spells at 1st level do not gain access to rare cantrips. A spellcaster gains access to rare cantrips only by uncovering their secrets in some other way. Some are guarded by jealous mages, while others are lost in missing libraries or molder on forgotten scrolls.  
  
These cantrips are not legal in Pathfinder Society play. Note that *penumbra* was changed into the higher-level spell *protective penumbra*. The cantrip version is similar, but does not replace its higher-level counterpart.
