## Dream Shield

**source**:: Occult Origins pg. 28  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: alchemist 2, arcanist 4, bard 2, investigator 2, medium 2, mesmerist 2, psychic 3, shaman 2, skald 2, sorcerer 4, witch 4, wizard 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (hollow glass ball or dreamcatcher)

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

You ward the target’s mind against intrusion and influence while she is unconscious. While sleeping, the target is protected against divinations such as *nondetection* and gains spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level against mind-affecting effects. In addition, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spell or effect that would possess or exercise direct mental control over her. This functions in all respects like the second property of *protection from evil* but it applies regardless of the alignment of the creature or object that created the possession or mental influence effect.  
  
If the target is awake, instead of the previous effects, the *dream shield* provides a +4 bonus on saving throws against sleep effects. The spell’s other effects are suppressed while the target is awake. If the target falls asleep or is otherwise rendered unconscious, the other effects of the *dream shield* resume. Every 10 minutes spent awake consumes 1 hour of the *dream shield’s* duration.
