### Description

You create a semi-living intelligent draconic servant that loyally obeys and serves you. Treat this servant as a pseudodragon with all of the abilities granted by one of the following spells: *form of the alien dragon I*, *form of the dragon I*, or *form of the exotic dragon I*. Your draconic ally can use its breath weapon once per day. Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell’s range, and can go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command. The draconic ally speaks one language of your choice that you know. You cannot have more than one draconic ally at a time. As long as a previous ally exists, you cannot successfully cast this spell again. If you have a breath weapon, you can cast this spell as a standard action by expending one use of your breath weapon as a free action when you cast the spell.  
  
Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship Apsu or Dahak add *draconic ally* to their spell lists as a 3rd-level spell.
