### Description

You can detect other worshipers of your deity (mortal worshipers, outsider servants, and so on). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you focus on a particular area or subject.  
  
*1st Round*: Presence or absence of the faithful.  
  
*2nd Round*: Number of individual faithful in the area.  
  
*3rd Round*: The exact location of each worshiper. If a fellow worshiper is outside your line of sight, then you discern his direction but not his exact location.  
  
Each round, you can rotate to detect worshipers in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but a sheet of lead, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. A creature’s personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether or not it is of the same faith as you-hence heretics and splinter cultists of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. Furthermore, since the spell picks up a creature’s current beliefs and feelings, a creature actively pretending to be a member of the same faith also appears to the spell to be a member. Thus, the spell is still useful in locating potential hidden members of the same faith among the general populace, but on its own, it doesn’t weed out spies.
