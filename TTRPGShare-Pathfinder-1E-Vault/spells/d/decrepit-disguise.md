**duration**:: 1 day/level  
**saving-throw**:: none (object) or Will disbelief (if interacted with)
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

You make an object seem like a worthless version of itself. A masterwork or magic sword could seem to be a useless, rusting, discarded blade, and a luxurious throne could appear to be a decrepit wooden chair. If used against an attended object, the wielder can immediately attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. *Decrepit disguise* counters and dispels *quintessence*.  
  
*Decrepit disguise* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell by a caster of 9th level or higher for the cost of 500 gp.
