### Description 

This spell functions as *ancestral regression*^ARG^, except as noted above and as follows. The wayang loses her darkvision racial trait and gains the low-light vision racial trait in its place. The alignment and personality of the wayang are not affected by the transformation, but the spell conceals her alignment as per *undetectable alignment*. Unlike *ancestral regression*, this spell grants the target a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as a gnome; even though the wayang appears as a gnomish analog of herself, the differences between gnomes and wayangs are great enough that she cannot be mistaken for a gnome by other wayangs who know her.
