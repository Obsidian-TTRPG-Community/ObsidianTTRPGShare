# False Belief 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 214  
**school**:: enchantment (compulsion) (mind-affecting)
**level**:: bard 2, mesmerist 2, psychic 2, skald 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes, plus length of memory to be altered  
**components**:: V, S, M (lemon juice and a scrap of parchment)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: willing creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You temporarily alter the target’s memory (similar to *modify memory*) to eliminate, change, or implant a memory of up to 1 hour in length. When the duration of this expires, the target’s real memory returns, and the false memory fades to little more than a vague outline, like a dream. This false memory seems true to the target, so effects that detect lies or force the target to speak the truth (as the subject understands it) don’t detect the falsehood.
