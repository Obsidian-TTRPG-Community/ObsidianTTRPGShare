### Description 

You fill the target with a sense of entitled self-importance, making the subject unable to bear the indignity of another creature getting something that it doesn’t have. Whenever an ally of the target receives a harmless spell or spell-like ability, beneficial supernatural effect, or assisting action (including the aid another action, first aid using the Heal skill, etc.) that doesn’t also include the target, the target is driven into a murderous rage against either the producer of that effect or the nearest creature that benefited from that effect, whichever is closer. The target must attack that creature on its next turn. Any ability that deals lethal damage is considered an attack for this purpose. Once the target deals lethal damage to the object of his jealous rage, the compulsion to attack that creature ends.
