### Description 

You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the area. The *shifting sand* obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the *shifting sand* must make a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws.  
  
As a move action, you may move the area of *shifting sand* up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or prone in the spellâ€™s area are carried along with the *shifting sand* in the same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects may also be carried along or shallowly buried by the *shifting sand*.
