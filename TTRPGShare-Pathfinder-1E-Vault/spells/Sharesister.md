### Description 

Ithuna Vardsdottir claims to have unearthed this ancient prayer in a ruined temple of Desna, though Pathfinders have reported the use of similar magic in Irrisen among the White Witches. While the name of this spell is *sharesister*, it works equally well on male or female creatures-both targets of the spell must simply be of the same gender.  
  
When you deliver the spell, you receive a negative level for the duration of the spell, and the other target receives a +1 insight bonus to her caster level and a +1 insight bonus to the save DCs of all of her spells. At 11th level, you can opt to take four negative levels to grant a +2 insight bonus to the other targetâ€™s caster level and spell save DCs if you wish, while at 17th level you can take 6 negative levels to increase the insight bonus to +3. Any effect that removes or prevents the negative level immediately ends the *sharesister* spell. Negative levels received from the spell vanish as soon as this spell effect ends. Negative levels from multiple castings of this spell stack.
