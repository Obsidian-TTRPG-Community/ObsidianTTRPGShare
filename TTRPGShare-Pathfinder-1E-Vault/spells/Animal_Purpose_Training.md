### Description 

You instill the target animal with a general purpose (see the Handle Animal skill), which can be any purpose except combat training-fighting, guarding, heavy labor, hunting, performance, or riding. This purpose supersedes the animalâ€™s previous trained purpose and any tricks it knows. When the spell ends, the animal reverts to its previous trained purpose and known tricks.
