# Depilate 

**source**:: Blood of the Beast pg. 27  
**school**:: necromancy
**level**:: arcanist 1, bard 1, druid 1, hunter 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, witch 1, wizard 1 (Tengu)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: S, M (a sliver of cow's tongue)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature with hair or fur  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This simple jinx causes a target’s hair or fur to fall out in patchy clumps, leaving the creature disheveled and less commanding. A jinxed creature takes a -2 penalty on all Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform checks until the hair begins to regrow 1 week later, or until the damage can be concealed with a successful Disguise or Heal check (the DC is equal to the original save DC of the spell). A successful *break enchantment*, *remove curse*, or similar effect instantly regrows the target’s hair or fur and removes the spell’s effects.
