### Description 

You bring into being a localized region of increased gravity that crushes a creature to the ground. Affected targets weigh twice as much as normal, can move only at half speed, jump only half as far as normal, and can lift and carry only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by two steps (from good to poor, for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fly check to remain in the air.  
  
*Freedom of movement* negates the effects of this spell. A creature targeted by *gravity well* behaves normally in the area of a reverse *gravity spell*.
