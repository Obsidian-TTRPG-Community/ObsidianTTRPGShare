### Casting

**components**:: V, S, M (1 drop of blood from a good outsider or 1 dose of holy water)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 round/2 levels

### Description 

You anoint a wounded creature with the blood of an outsider with the good subtype (such as an angel) or holy water, giving it fast healing 1. The target radiates the aura of a good creature for the duration of the spell and can sense the righteousness of the magic, though this has no long-term effect on the targetâ€™s alignment. If the target has its own evil aura, this is not suppressed by celestial healing, and can also be detected normally.
