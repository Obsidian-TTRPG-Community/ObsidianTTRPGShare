# Signifer's Rally 

**source**:: Cheliax, Empire of Devils pg. 23  
**school**:: conjuration (teleportation) (evil)

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (100 gp worth of bloodstone for every ally teleported)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one willing ally/5 levels  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

You teleport up to one ally per five caster levels to your location. You determine which allies you want to teleport at the time of casting; these allies have 1 round to decide to allow or refuse your spell, and they teleport immediately upon accepting. Allies are teleported as if you had cast *teleport* on them (your current location is at least “studied carefully” for this purpose), appearing in a puff of brimstone in a space adjacent to you. If you are in combat and your allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon arrival but are not considered flat-footed even though they have not taken any actions. The spell does not function in areas warded against intrusion by evil creatures (such as a *magic circle against evil* effect).
