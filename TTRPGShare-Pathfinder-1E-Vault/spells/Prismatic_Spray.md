## Mythic Prismatic Spray 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 104  
The spell automatically blinds creatures with up to 12 Hit Dice instead of 8 Hit Dice. Attempt one bull rush combat maneuver and apply its results to each creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush doesnâ€™t provoke an attack of opportunity.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the area changes from a cone into a line. Creatures in the line are struck by two beams (or three, if the creature rolls an 8 on the table). The spell bypasses energy resistance and immunity.
