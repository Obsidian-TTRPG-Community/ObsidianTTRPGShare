### Description 

The spell allows you channel fire into your very being. If you donâ€™t already have the fire subtype, this spell grants you the fire subtype. If you already have the fire subtype, you instead channel the flames from your being outward, creating a 10-foot-radius aura of fire centered on you. Creatures who enter or end their turns in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d8 points of fire damage.  
  
Multiple castings of this spell stack; you can cast it once on yourself to gain the fire subtype, then again to manifest the aura of flames around you.
