# Auditory Hallucination 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 204  
**school**:: illusion (phantasm) (mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 1, bard 1, magus 1, medium 1, mesmerist 1, occultist 1, psychic 1, skald 1, sorcerer 1, wizard 1

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: S

### Effect 

**range**:: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart  
**duration**:: concentration  
**saving-throw**:: Will disbelief
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You cause the targets to believe they hear any sound you imagine. The sound can include intelligible speech. Instead of precisely imagining a sound, you can identify a sound the subjects know and they imagine it doing what you describe as you cast the spell. For example, you could cast this spell on orc warriors and have them imagine the sound of their chieftain calling for help, even if you’ve never heard their chieftain and even if the chieftain speaks in a language you don’t understand. All targets hear the same hallucination. You can change the sound as part of concentrating on the spell.

**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions as *auditory hallucination*, except that you can include the image of any object, creature, or force you imagine or identify for the targets to imagine. You can move the image while you concentrate. After you cease concentration, you can define simple movements or changes for the phantasm to perform that can be explained in 25 words or fewer.  
  
The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately or instruct it to do so. Its AC is equal to 10 + the level of this spell.

# Permanent Hallucination 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 221  
**school**:: illusion (phantasm) (mind-affecting)
**level**:: arcanist 7, psychic 7, sorcerer 7, wizard 7

**saving-throw**:: Will disbelief
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions as *audiovisual hallucination*, except that the phantasm you create includes visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal components, and the phantasm follows a complex script. The phantasm follows that script without your having to concentrate on it and can react to stimuli the target perceives, as appropriate for the script. Unlike most illusions with a save to disbelieve, if the target disbelieves a *permanent hallucination*, she can choose to end the effect entirely at any time.

# Triggered Hallucination 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 227

**level**:: arcanist 6, bard 6, magus 6, mesmerist 6, occultist 6, psychic 6, sorcerer 6, wizard 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (jade dust worth 25 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: permanent until triggered, then 1 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will disbelief
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions as *audiovisual hallucination*, except that this spell’s phantasm has no apparent effect until a specific condition occurs. You must overcome the target’s spell resistance to plant the *triggered hallucination*, but the target doesn’t attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with audiovisual hallucination). The phantasm can include auditory, olfactory, visual, tactile, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.  
  
You set the triggering condition (such as hearing a certain word or seeing a type of creature) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger can’t be based on any quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. *Triggered hallucination* uses the target’s senses to notice triggers.
