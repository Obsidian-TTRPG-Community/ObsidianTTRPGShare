### Description 

The spell allows you to channel cold into your very being. If you donâ€™t already have the cold subtype, this spell grants you the cold subtype. If you already have the cold subtype, you instead channel the frost from your being outward, creating a 10-footradius aura of cold centered on you. Creatures who enter or end their turns in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d8 points of cold damage.  
  
Multiple castings of this spell stack; you can cast it once on yourself to gain the cold subtype, then again to manifest the aura of frost around you.
