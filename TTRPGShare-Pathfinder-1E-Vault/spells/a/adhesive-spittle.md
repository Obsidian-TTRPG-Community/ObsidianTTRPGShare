## Adhesive Spittle

**source**:: Advanced Class Guide pg. 172  
**school**:: conjuration (creation)
**level**:: alchemist 1, arcanist 1, investigator 1, psychic 1, sorcerer 1, witch 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: 15 ft.  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 round/level or until discharged (see text)  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex partial
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

Once during this spell’s duration, you can spit a viscous liquid as a standard action. This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do not have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to counteract this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to break the adhesive, or to cast a spell) use the spell’s DC rather than a tanglefoot bag’s normal DCs. The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after you spit it.
