## Aura of Cannibalism

**source**:: Monster Codex pg. 9  
**school**:: necromancy (evil)
**level**:: arcanist 3, cleric 3, oracle 3, sorcerer 3, warpriest 3, witch 3, wizard 3

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a piece of flesh from another creature of your species)

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**area**:: 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on you  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You emanate an aura that saps the strength of others of your kind and channels their energy into you. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the spell’s area and shares both your creature type and at least one subtype you possess (if any), that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of damage. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you deal with this spell (maximum 10 + your caster level). These temporary hit points go away when the spell ends.  
  
As long as you have at least 5 temporary hit points while this spell is in effect, you gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If you have 15 or more temporary hit points, this competence bonus increases to +2.
