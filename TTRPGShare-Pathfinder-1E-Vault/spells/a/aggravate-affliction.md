## Aggravate Affliction

**source**:: Pathfinder \#82: Secrets of the Sphinx pg. 75  
**school**:: necromancy
**level**:: arcanist 4, cleric 3, druid 3, hunter 3, oracle 3, sorcerer 4, warpriest 3, witch 3, wizard 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

All recurring afflictions (those with a frequency,including curses, diseases, and poison) possessed by the targeted creature immediately trigger, requiring an immediate saving throw (as described in the affliction) to avoid suffering their effects. A successful saving throw does not count toward ending the affliction, and this extra save does not change the timing of the next save against the affliction. Afflictions without a frequency are unaffected by this spell.
