**level**:: alchemist 1, arcanist 1, cleric 1, inquisitor 1, investigator 1, oracle 1, sorcerer 1, warpriest 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**components**:: V, S, DF/M (a miniature magnifying glass or spectacles)

### Effect

### Description

Your understanding of the written word becomes analytical and discerning. You gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on Appraise checks to determine the value of books and scrolls and on Linguistics checks to detect forgeries, and you can attempt a Linguistics check to detect a forged document at a glance, rather than taking the normal 1 round of examination per page. In addition, you immediately detect whether written works within 30 feet and within your line of sight have a magical aura and the strength of any such auras, as though you had concentrated on each written work for 1 round using *detect magic*.
