### Description

You contact the spirits of your ancestors and use their great wisdom to bolster your own knowledge. Consulting with the spirits is a full-round action. If you consult with the spirits before making a Knowledge check, you gain a +4 insight bonus on the check. If you have already failed at a Knowledge check, you may consult with your ancestors and make another attempt. The insight bonus on these checks increases to +6 at caster level 7th and +8 at caster level 11th. You may consult with the spirits for this purpose as often as you like while the spell remains in effect. Only you can hear the spirits speak to you.
