### Description

*Abeyance* suppresses the effects of a single curse on a creature. It does not restore any damage or drain that might have been caused by the curse. *Abeyance* cannot suppress curses that cannot be removed by *remove curse*, but it can suppress curses such as lycanthropy that require *remove curse* along with additional measures. An individual curse can be suppressed only once by abeyance, even if cast by a different caster.  
  
*Abeyance* does not allow a creature to divest itself of cursed objects, though it can suppress a curse contracted from an object.
