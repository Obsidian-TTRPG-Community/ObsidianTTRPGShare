### Description

Invisible layers of solid force surround and protect the target, granting that target a +2 armor bonus to AC. Additionally, the first 5 points of lethal damage the target takes from each attack are converted into nonlethal damage. Against attacks that already deal nonlethal damage, the target gains DR 5/-. Once this spell has converted 5 points of damage to nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), the spell is discharged.

Add half your tier to the spell’s armor bonus. Add half your tier to the amount of lethal damage from each attack that is converted to nonlethal damage and to the DR against nonlethal damage. Add half your tier to your caster level when determining how much damage the spell converts before it’s discharged.
