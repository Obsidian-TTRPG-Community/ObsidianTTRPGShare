### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**effect**:: 1 hippocampus plus 1 hippocampus/3 caster levels  
**duration**:: 1 hour/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

You summon a school of hippocampi (one plus one per 3 caster levels, to a maximum of six at 15th level) to serve as combat-trained mounts. The hippocampi avoid combat if possible but defend themselves if attacked. If any hippocampus attacks, the remaining duration of the spell changes from 1 hour per level to 1 round per level (so if a full 4 hours remained, the hippocampi last for only 4 more rounds).
