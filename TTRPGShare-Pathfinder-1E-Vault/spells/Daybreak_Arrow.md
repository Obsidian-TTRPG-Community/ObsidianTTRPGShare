### Description 

You cause ammunition, including shuriken, to exude radiant energy. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take these penalties for 1 round after being struck by such ammunition. Undead and creatures harmed by sunlight take an additional 1d6 points of damage from such projectiles. This extra damage and half of any other damage you deal with an affected projectile results directly from radiant energy and is not subject to damage resistance. Such a projectile sheds light as if it were a sunrod for 1 round after it is fired or thrown.

## Mythic Daybreak Arrow 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 90  
The additional damage to undead and creatures harmed by sunlight increases to 1d8. The affected ammunition is entirely composed of radiant energy, and bypasses all damage resistance from undead targets and those harmed by sunlight. The duration of the sunrod light effect increases to 1 minute.
