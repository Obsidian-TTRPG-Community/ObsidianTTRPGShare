Any creature of chaotic, neutral, or evil alignment who targets you with a spell must succeed at a Will save or take a -4 penalty on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks for the spellâ€™s duration.

The penalties for alignment components stack (therefore, a chaotic evil spellcaster would take a -8 penalty).
