### Description 

When you cast *imprisonment* and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the *temporal stasis* spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a *freedom* spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a *crystal ball*, a *locate object* spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but *discern location* does. A *wish* or *miracle* spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a -4 penalty on its save.
