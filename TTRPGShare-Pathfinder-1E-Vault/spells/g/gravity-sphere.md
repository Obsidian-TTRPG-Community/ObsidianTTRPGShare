### Description

You affect the local gravity field in a 30-foot-radius sphere around the spell’s designated point of origin. Creatures in the affected area can be weighed down by high gravity, lightened by low gravity, or left to float in an area with no gravity, depending on the effect you choose for your *gravity sphere*. See page 18 for rules on the effects of high, low, and no gravity.  
  
Creatures that fall within the area of a *gravity sphere* spell take more damage from the fall if the gravity within is higher and less damage if the gravity within is lower. However, if the creature falls through a *gravity sphere* and continues to fall in a non-affected area, the rest of the fall damage is calculated normally. For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a lowgravity sphere and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low gravity plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).  
  
This spell doesn’t counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect gravity; both effects occur simultaneously. For instance, a no-gravity *gravity sphere* spell cast within the area of a *reverse gravity* spell would simply mean that creatures float about until the *gravity sphere*’s duration expires or they exit the *gravity sphere*, at which point they return to the top of the reverse gravity effect’s area. If both gravity-altering magical effects could not feasibly take place simultaneously (at the GM’s discretion), the *gravity sphere* spell supersedes the previous effect (if it’s higher-level than the previous effect) or simply fails (if it’s lower-level).
