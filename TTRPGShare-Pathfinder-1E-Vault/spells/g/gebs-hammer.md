### Description

Centuries of war with Nex trained the necromancers of Geb to extract every last resource from the mindless undead that make up most of Geb’s rank-and-file troops.  
  
When you cast this spell, you draw the remains of nearby destroyed undead together and fuse them into a mass of flesh and bone you can then hurl at any foes within range. Three corpses within range of the spell are required for the spell to function. *Geb’s hammer* can be directed to attack one foe within range per round as a move action. It uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, modified by your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever one is highest). On a hit, the corpse hammer deals 1d6 points of damage per three caster levels (to a maximum of 6d6 points of damage).  
  
*Geb’s hammer* also has secondary effects based on the nature of the three bodies you use to create it. If the majority used to create *Geb’s hammer* (at least two) were skeletal, the jagged bits of bone cause the corpse hammer to deal slashing damage and increase *Geb’s hammer’s* critical threat range to 19-20. On the other hand, if the majority were fleshy (at least two), the increased mass causes *Geb’s hammer* to deal bludgeoning damage and increase its critical hit damage to ×3.  
  
Undead that have been destroyed by positive energy or a similar effect that does not leave a corpse, like a *disintegrate* spell, cannot be used to form *Geb’s hammer*.
