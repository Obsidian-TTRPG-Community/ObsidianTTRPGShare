### Description

You cause a long, thin vine to sprout from your body-typically from the center of your chest or from the palm of an outstretched hand. As a standard action, you can direct the end of the vine to move to any square within 20 feet of you and perform one of the following tasks: deliver a touch spell that you cast after the vine has grown, pick up an unattended object weighing 20 pounds or less, give a held object to another creature, attempt to disable a trap or lock using your Disable Device modifier with a -2 penalty, or perform any other task that the GM deems reasonable. The vine does not threaten squares and cannot make attacks of opportunity, nor can it wield weapons.
