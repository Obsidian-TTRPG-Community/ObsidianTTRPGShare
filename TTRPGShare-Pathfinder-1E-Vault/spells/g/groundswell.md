**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched

### Description

This spell allows the target to cause the ground to rise up beneath him. As a swift action, the target can cause the ground to rise 5 feet, while all adjacent squares are treated as steep slopes. The *groundswell* precludes flanking from creatures standing at lower elevations than the target. If the target moves after creating a *groundswell*, the ground returns to its normal elevation at the end of his turn; otherwise, it remains in place until the target moves or uses a swift action to return the ground to normal. A *groundswell* cannot increase elevation of the ground beyond 5 feet.
