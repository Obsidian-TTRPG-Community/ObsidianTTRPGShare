### Description

*Gravity bow* significantly increases the weight and density of arrows or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant before they strike their target and then return them to normal a few moments later. Any arrow fired from a bow or crossbow you are carrying when the spell is cast deals damage as if one size larger than it actually is. For instance, an arrow fired from a Medium longbow normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if fired from a *gravity bow*. Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses your bow to make an attack the arrows deal damage as normal for their size.
