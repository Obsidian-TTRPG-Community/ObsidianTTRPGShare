# Pyrotechnic Eruption 

**source**:: Horror Adventures pg. 125  
**school**:: evocation (fire)
**level**:: arcanist 4, bloodrager 3, magus 4, occultist 4, sorcerer 4, wizard 4

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a pinch of coal)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: see text  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex half (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

The caster causes jets of flame to erupt from the ground and surround the target. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) unless it succeeds at a Reflex save for half damage. The blaze surrounds the target for the duration of the spell, forcing the creature to attempt a new save each round. Each round, the damage dealt is reduced to half as many d6; the spell expires when it would deal no damage. If the target moves, the *pyrotechnic eruption* follows, even if the target teleports.  
  
Anyone attempting to touch the target takes damage, using the same amount of dice as the last time the target attempted a save (Reflex half). A creature can take the place of the target by bull rushing or grappling it and switching places. The new creature then automatically takes the current roundâ€™s damage with no saving throw and can begin to attempt Reflex saves starting on its next turn.
