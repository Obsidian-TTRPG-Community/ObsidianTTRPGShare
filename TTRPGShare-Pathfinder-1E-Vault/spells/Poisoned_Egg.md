### Description 

You transform the contents of a normal egg into a single dose of small centipede poison (injury; *save* DC 11; *frequency* 1/round for 4 rounds; *effect* 1 Dex; *cure* 1 save). The poison reverts to a normal egg at the end of the spell’s duration (the reverted egg substance is harmless unless the poisoned creature is vulnerable to eggs). The egg may be raw or cooked but must be whole and not empty when you cast the spell. When applying the poisoned egg’s contents to a weapon, the wielder has no chance of poisoning herself, as though she had the poison use class feature.
