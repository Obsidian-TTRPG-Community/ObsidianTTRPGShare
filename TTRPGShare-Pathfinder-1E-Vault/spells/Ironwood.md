### Description 

*Ironwood* is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, *ironwood* is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on *ironwood*. Spells that affect wood do affect *ironwood*, although *ironwood* does not burn. Using this spell with *wood shape* or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.  
  
Further, if you make only half as much *ironwood* as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.
