### Description 

You create a sticky ball of burning tar that you can hurl at your enemies as a ranged attack. If the tar ball strikes, it deals 1d4 points of fire damage + your Strength modifier, and splashes the target with hot, sticky tar. The tar deals 1d4 points of fire damage each round on the creatureâ€™s turn for the next 1d4 rounds and gives the target a -2 penalty to Dexterity for that duration. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish or cool the tar before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing or cooling the tar requires a DC 15 Reflex save or at least 1 gallon of nonflammable liquid. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically cooling the target automatically ends the effect.
