### Description 

Using a slashing motion with the spell’s focus as part of the casting of *shadow invasion*, you cut open a rift to the Plane of Shadow that fills a 30-foot area with shadowy energies. This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as *darkness*). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the shadow subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as *shadow evocation*) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of shadow invasion.  
  
In addition, the rift created by *shadow invasion* has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When *shadow invasion* is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton will be summoned under the caster’s command (as per *summon monster V*). This chance is 5% for every full round that shadow invasion was active. If the caster level of *shadow invasion* is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutor kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of *shadow invasion* would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors.
