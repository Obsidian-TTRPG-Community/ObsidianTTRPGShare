### Description 

You call upon the primordial power of ancient megafauna to boost the size of your target. Because of its connection to living creatures of the distant past, the spell does not function on outsiders, undead, and summoned creatures. Your target grows to legendary proportions, increasing in size by one category. The creature’s height doubles and its weight increases by a factor of 8. The target gains a +6 size bonus to its Strength score and a +4 size bonus to its Constitution score. It gains a +6 size bonus to its natural armor, and DR 10/adamantine. Its carrying capacity changes to reflect its new size. The creature’s equipment and weapons, if any, also increase in size. Any enlarged item that leaves the creature’s possession returns to its original size (though thrown weapons and ammunition deal damage at their enlarged size before returning to their true proportions).  
  
If insufficient room is available to accommodate the creature’s growth, it attains the maximum possible size and can attempt a Strength check (using its increased Strength score) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it. The spell cannot crush a creature by enclosing it.
