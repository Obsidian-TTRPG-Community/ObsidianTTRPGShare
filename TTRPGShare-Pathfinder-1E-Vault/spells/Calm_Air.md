### Description 

This spell calms the air and disperses fog, dust, and other particles. The wind force in the area is reduced in strength by one step per 4 caster levels (to a minimum wind force of light) and clouds are dispersed, although parts of nonmagical clouds that extend beyond the area are not affected. If a magical cloud or wind’s point of origin is inside the area of a calm air spell, the whole effect is suppressed; otherwise, only the part inside the area is suppressed. Suppression still counts against the duration of a wind or cloud effect. Magical wind and cloud effects are suppressed only if you succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + effect’s caster level). You can move the calm air effect by concentrating as a standard action.
