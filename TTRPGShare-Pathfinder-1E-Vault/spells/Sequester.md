# Sequester 

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 340  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: arcanist 7, psychic 7, sorcerer 7, summoner 5, summoner (unchained) 6, wizard 7

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a basilisk eyelash and gum arabic)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: one willing creature or object (up to a 2-ft. cube/level) touched  
**duration**:: 1 day/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none or Will negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: no or yes (object)

### Description 

When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating the target and also renders the affected target invisible (as the *invisibility* spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by *sequester* become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.  
  
*Note*: The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being sequestered. There is no save to see the sequestered creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.
