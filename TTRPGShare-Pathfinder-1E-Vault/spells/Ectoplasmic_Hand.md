### Description 

You draw forth a ghostly, animated hand through the ectoplasmic veil to manipulate objects, attack creatures, and deliver touch spells at a distance. The hand remains tethered to you by tendrils of ectoplasm. The *ectoplasmic hand* and its tether have hardness 10 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. The tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length, ending the spell. The *ectoplasmic hand* has improved evasion, uses your save bonuses, and has an AC of 24 (+6 natural armor, +8 size). The *ectoplasmic hand* moves up to 30 feet per round, and on each of your turns you can spend a move action to move it an additional 30 feet. If you spend a swift action, the *ectoplasmic hand* can make an attack using your base attack bonus, modifying its attack rolls and damage rolls with your spellcasting ability score (the ability score that determines your spell save DCs). It deals 1d6 points of damage with a slam attack, and it can wield any light or one-handed weapon. The *ectoplasmic hand* threatens and can flank targets.  
  
The *ectoplasmic hand* can also perform additional functions.  
  
**Deliver Touch Spell**: The *ectoplasmic hand* can deliver any spell of 6th level or lower that has a range of touch that you cast. You gain a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll when doing so.  
  
**Manipulate Object**: The *ectoplasmic hand* can manipulate unattended objects weighing no more than 5 pounds per caster level, moving them up to 20 feet per round in any direction you desire, to the limits of this spell’s range. It can pull levers, open unstuck doors, or knock over objects. If the *ectoplasmic hand* must attempt a Strength check, it uses your spellcasting ability score as its Strength score. Using the *ectoplasmic hand* in this way requires you to concentrate and spend any actions you would normally need to use to manipulate the object yourself.  
  
**Combat Maneuver**: You can spend a standard action to command the *ectoplasmic hand* to perform a bull rush, disarm, drag^APG^, steal^APG^, or trip combat maneuver against a target creature, using your caster level as its CMB and your spellcasting ability score as its Strength score. The *ectoplasmic hand* takes no penalties for its size. This action doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity against the *ectoplasmic hand*.
