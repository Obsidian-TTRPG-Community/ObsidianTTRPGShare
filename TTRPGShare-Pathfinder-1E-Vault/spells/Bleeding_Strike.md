### Description 

You imbue a slashing melee weapon with the ability to create a bleeding wound. As a free action when the weapon hits a living creature, the wielder can discharge this spell to add 1 point of bleed damage to the weaponâ€™s base damage. This bleeding is difficult to stop; add your spellcasting ability modifier (Wisdom for clerics, and so on) to the DC to stop the bleeding.
