### Description

This spell functions as *blur*, except that the blurring occurs only when you move at least 10 feet on your turn and ceases at the end of your movement. It is therefore mainly used to thwart attacks on your turn, such as attacks of opportunity. If you move at least twice your speed on your turn, the blurring lasts until the start of your next turn.
