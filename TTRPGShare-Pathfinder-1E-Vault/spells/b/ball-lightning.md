## Ball Lightning

**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 204

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF (a small iron ring)

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**effect**:: two or more 5-ft.-diameter spheres  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere’s course.  
  
If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.  
  
Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it’s a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A *ball lightning* globe winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.
