## Break

**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 207  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: arcanist 1, bloodrager 1, occultist 1, psychic 1, redmantisassassin 1, sorcerer 1, wizard 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a twig)

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one Medium or smaller object  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description

You can attempt to break or at least damage any one Medium or smaller object within range. If the target fails its Fortitude saving throw, it gains the broken condition. If cast on a broken item, that item is destroyed on a failed save.

## Mythic Break

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 87  
You can target up to 1 Medium or smaller object per caster level.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, target objects gain the broken condition on a successful save and are destroyed on a failed save. This doesn’t affect mythic objects or objects held or carried by mythic creatures.
