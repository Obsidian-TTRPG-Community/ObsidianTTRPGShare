**casting-time**:: 1 standard action

### Description

This spell functions like *bless*, except as noted. It works only in the caster’s home city, and in areas under the jurisdiction of the city watch. For example, if the watch patrols a shantytown outside the city walls but not the ruined subterranean tunnels that lie beneath the city, the spell works in the former area but not the latter.
