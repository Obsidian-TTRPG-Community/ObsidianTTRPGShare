## Binding Earth

**source**:: Advanced Race Guide pg. 149  
**school**:: transmutation (earth)
**level**:: druid 2, hunter 2, witch 2 (oread)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature or unattended object (see text)  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

If the target of this spell fails its Fortitude save, areas of earth and stone floor act as a snapping quagmire that pulls the target down and damages it if it attempts to move through such terrain.  
  
If the target is a creature, it treats all areas of earth and stone it moves through as difficult terrain. Furthermore, for each 5 feet a creature moves through such areas, it takes 1d6 points of damage. Creatures with a burrow speed or the earth glide ability are unaffected by *binding earth*.  
  
If cast on an unattended object resting on an area of stone or earth, the stone or earth warps and wraps around it, pulling it firmly to the ground. A DC 15 Strength check is required to pull the object free from snapping earth or stone.
