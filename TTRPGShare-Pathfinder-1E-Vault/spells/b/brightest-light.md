### Description

This trademark spell of the Lantern Bearers functions as *daylight*, except it lasts longer. In addition, as a swift action once during the spell’s duration, you can will the light to try to end a magical darkness effect located within 60 feet of the light this spell emits. Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level), with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the darkness effect. If you succeed, the darkness effect ends. Regardless of whether you are successful, the light from this spell dims to the brightness of a torch for the spell’s remaining duration.
