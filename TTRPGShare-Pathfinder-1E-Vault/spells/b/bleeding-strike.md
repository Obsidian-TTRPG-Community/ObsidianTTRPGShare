## Bleeding Strike

**source**:: Pathfinder \#77: Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth pg. 75  
**school**:: necromancy
**level**:: antipaladin 1, cleric 1, hunter 1, oracle 1, ranger 1, warpriest 1, witch 1 (Baphomet)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**effect**:: one slashing melee weapon touched  
**duration**:: 1 round/level or until discharged  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless, object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless, object)

### Description

You imbue a slashing melee weapon with the ability to create a bleeding wound. As a free action when the weapon hits a living creature, the wielder can discharge this spell to add 1 point of bleed damage to the weapon’s base damage. This bleeding is difficult to stop; add your spellcasting ability modifier (Wisdom for clerics, and so on) to the DC to stop the bleeding.
