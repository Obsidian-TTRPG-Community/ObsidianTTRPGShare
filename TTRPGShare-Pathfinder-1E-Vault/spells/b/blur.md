### Description

The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).  
  
A *see invisibility* spell does not counteract the *blur* effect, but a *true seeing* spell does.  
  
Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).
