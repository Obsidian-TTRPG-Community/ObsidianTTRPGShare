### Description

The *black spot* is a specific and feared pirate curse. An intangible, illusory black spot manifests above the target’s head and remains until the target dies or the curse is lifted. The *black spot* cannot be covered or hidden by any means, including other illusions.  
  
The *black spot* radiates a cursed aura in a 10-foot radius around its target. Anyone within the aura gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. In addition, the target has a -4 penalty on saving throws against death effects.  
  
Every day in which a creature bears a *black spot*, it must make a Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage. The damage cannot be healed until the *black spot* is removed. If the creature’s Constitution reaches 0, it dies. Pirates killed by this spell often return as ghosts, but that is not a direct effect of this spell.  
  
The *black spot* cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with *break enchantment*, *limited wish*, *miracle*, *remove curse*, or *wish*.
