# Icy Prison 

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 224  
**school**:: evocation (cold)
**level**:: arcanist 5, sorcerer 5, wizard 5

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level; see text  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex partial
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You trap the target in solid ice 1 inch thick per caster level. If the creature fails its save, it is helpless, but can still breathe (the ice blocks line of effect to the target). If the target makes its save, it gains the entangled condition but can otherwise act normally. Whether or not the target saves, it takes 1 point of cold damage per caster level each round it is helpless or entangled in the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness; if broken, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action with a successful Strength check (DC 15 + your caster level).
