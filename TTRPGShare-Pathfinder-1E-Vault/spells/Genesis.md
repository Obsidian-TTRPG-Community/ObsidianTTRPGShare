### Description 

You create an immobile, finite demiplane with limited access. Demiplanes created by this spell are very small. At first, the demiplane grows at a rate of 1-foot-radius per day, up to a 180-foot radius. You determine the environment in the demiplane, reflecting most any desire you can visualize, such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the shape of the terrain. The spell cannot create life, nor can it create buildings. If desired, these must be brought in by some other fashion.  
  
You can cast this spell again to enlarge the demiplane by 60 feet per casting if you are inside its boundaries.  
  
**Material Component**: A small crystalline sphere.  
**XP Cost**: 5,000 XP.
