**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: arcanist 1, bloodrager 1, occultist 1, psychic 1, redmantisassassin 1, sorcerer 1, wizard 1

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a twig)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one Medium or smaller object

**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description 

You can attempt to break or at least damage any one Medium or smaller object within range. If the target fails its Fortitude saving throw, it gains the broken condition. If cast on a broken item, that item is destroyed on a failed save.

## Mythic Break 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 87  
You can target up to 1 Medium or smaller object per caster level.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, target objects gain the broken condition on a successful save and are destroyed on a failed save. This doesnâ€™t affect mythic objects or objects held or carried by mythic creatures.

# Break, Greater 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 205  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: arcanist 6, bloodrager 4, occultist 6, psychic 6, sorcerer 6, wizard 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 round  
**components**:: V, S, M (an unbroken platinum tuning fork worth 100 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: 30 ft.  
**target**:: all Medium or smaller objects in a 30-ft. burst centered on you  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description 

You release a burst of destructive energy. Each Medium or smaller object in the area gains the broken condition unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. If a broken object fails this save, it is instead destroyed. Magic items can be broken by this spell, but not destroyed. Objects in your possession are not immune.
