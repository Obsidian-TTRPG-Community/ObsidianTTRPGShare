## Funereal Weapon

**source**:: Inner Sea Temples pg. 42  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: cleric 1, inquisitor 1, occultist 1, oracle 1, paladin 1, warpriest 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: weapon touched or 50 projectiles (all of which must be together at the time of casting)  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless, object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless, object)

### Description

You imbue a weapon with a faint silvery glow that dimly illuminates a 5-foot square. An affected weapon also easily bypasses the physical defenses of undead creatures, ignoring 5 points of an undead creature’s damage reduction, as long as the damage reduction is not DR/epic. For example, attacks with a weapon affected by this spell completely ignore a zombie’s DR 5/slashing or reduce a lich’s damage reduction to DR 10/bludgeoning and magic.  
  
You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. *Funereal weapon* affects the DR of only undead creatures.
