A magical fire warms your belly, granting fire resistance 5 and making your gut hot to the touch (but not enough to damage you or anything else). As a standard action, you can breathe a 15-foot cone of flame that deals 1d4 points of fire damage (Reflex half, SR applies). Each time you use this breath weapon, reduce the remaining duration of the spell by 1 minute.
