## Fey Blight

**source**:: Pathfinder \#119: Prisoners of the Blight pg. 73  
**school**:: transmutation (curse, ruse)

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 minute  
**components**:: V

### Effect

**range**:: touch or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living non-fey, non-plant creature  
**duration**:: see below (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description

The target is cursed, gaining the bane of the caster’s fey race (see below for details on each specific fey race’s bane and duration). A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to further castings of *fey blight* from the same type of fey for 24 hours. *Fey blight* cannot be dispelled, but effects that remove curses function against it.  
  
Attempts to identify *fey blight* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as *fey boon* (see the ruse descriptor on page 192 of *Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue*).
