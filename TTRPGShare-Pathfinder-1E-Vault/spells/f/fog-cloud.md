## Fog Cloud

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 284  
**school**:: conjuration (creation)
**level**:: arcanist 2, druid 2, hunter 2, magus 2, shaman 2, sorcerer 2, summoner (unchained) 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**effect**:: fog spreads in 20-ft. radius  
**duration**:: 10 min./level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).  
  
A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.  
  
The spell does not function underwater.

## Mythic Fog Cloud

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 95  
The radius of the fog increases to 50 feet.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the fog’s radius changes to 500 feet, and its height changes to 100 feet. Winds can’t dissipate the fog unless the area of the wind affects the entire area of the augmented *mythic fog cloud*. If you’re at least 6th tier and instead expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the fog’s radius changes to 1 mile, and its height changes to 500 feet. The cloud is as resistant to wind as the 3rd-tier augmented version.
