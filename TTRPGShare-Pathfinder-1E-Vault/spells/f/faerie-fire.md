## Faerie Fire

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 280  
**school**:: evocation (light)
**level**:: druid 1, hunter 1, mesmerist 1

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, DF

### Effect

**range**:: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)  
**area**:: creatures and objects within a 5-ft.-radius burst  
**duration**:: 1 min./level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by *faerie fire* take a -20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical *darkness* effect functions normally), *blur*, *displacement*, *invisibility*, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The *faerie fire* can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The *faerie fire* does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

## Mythic Faerie Fire

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 93  
Outlined creatures are dazzled. The spell outlines figment illusions in the burst, revealing them as such. This effect applies only to figments with a caster level equal to or less than your tier.  
  
**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, each creature in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round.
