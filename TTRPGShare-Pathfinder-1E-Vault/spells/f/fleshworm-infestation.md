## Fleshworm Infestation

**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 220  
**school**:: conjuration (summoning) (evil)
**level**:: arcanist 4, cleric 4, inquisitor 4, oracle 4, psychic 4, sorcerer 4, warpriest 4, witch 4, wizard 4

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: creature touched  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude partial (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description

With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest in the target’s flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save every round. Failure means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage, and is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. *Fleshworm infestation* cannot be ended early by *remove disease* or *heal*, as the infestation starts anew if the current worms are slain. *Protection from evil* negates this spell’s effects for as long as the two durations overlap. *Dispel evil* automatically ends a *fleshworm infestation*.
