You also gain one bite attack (1d8), two claw attacks (1d6), and either a gore attack (1d8) if you assume the form of an imperial dragon or two wing attacks (1d4) if you assume the form of a primal dragon. Your breath weapon, resistance, and any other benefits you gain depend on the type of dragon. You can use the breath weapon only once per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal damage.
