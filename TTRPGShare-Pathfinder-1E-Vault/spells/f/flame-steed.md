### Description

You conjure a Large, quasi-real creature made of flame. It functions like *phantom steed*, except as follows.  
  
The flame steed is immune to fire and has acid, cold, and electricity resistance 10. If it or its rider is attacked, it automatically exhales a 15-foot cone of smoke and ash on your turn as a free action. Anyone in the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC equal to the spell DC) or become sickened for 1d6 rounds after leaving the area. This smoke acts as obscuring mist for the purpose of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round.
