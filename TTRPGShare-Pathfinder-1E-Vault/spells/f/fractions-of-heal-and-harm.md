## Fractions of Heal and Harm

**source**:: Inner Sea Gods pg. 234, Pathfinder \#41: The Thousand Fangs Below pg. 73

### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 swift action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: instantaneous

### Description

This spell channels a portion of the next spell you cast into magic that heals you. The next instantaneous area damage spell of 3rd level or lower that you cast deals only 75% of its damage, but heals you of a number of hit points equal to the remaining 25% of the spell’s damage. For example, if you cast this spell and followed it with a *fireball* that would normally deal 40 hit points of damage, the *fireball* instead deals 30 hit points of damage and heals you of 10 hit points of damage. The spell affected by this spell must be cast before the end of your next turn. This spell has no effect on spells that do not deal damage or spells higher than 3rd level. This healing is treated as if you had been affected by a cure or inflict spell (whichever would heal you), and is treated as the same spell level as the area-affecting spell for the purpose of effects that relate to the spell level of cure or inflict spells.
