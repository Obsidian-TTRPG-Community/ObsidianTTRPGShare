### Description

You change outfits or create a disguise out of materials you are wearing or carrying (potentially including a disguise kit). The spell can’t alter your body or change the structure of objects, but can style wigs, apply makeup or piercings, and otherwise make use of tools to make superficial changes. In an instant, you have a nonmagical disguise or clothing change. Attempt a Disguise check to determine the effectiveness of the disguise.
