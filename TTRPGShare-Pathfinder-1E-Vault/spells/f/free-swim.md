### Description

The target can move and attack underwater normally without the usual penalties involved with underwater combat, as if under the effects of *freedom of movement*. However, the target doesn’t gain any protections against grapple, paralysis, and magical effects that impede movement (such as *solid fog*, *slow*, and *web*).
