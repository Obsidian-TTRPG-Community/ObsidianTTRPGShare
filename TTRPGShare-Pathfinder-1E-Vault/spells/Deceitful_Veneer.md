### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 10 minutes/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You subtly alter both the targetâ€™s aura and subtle cues in its body language, tone of voice, and word choice, which makes everything that the target says seem to be a lie. Every statement that the target makes appears to be a lie under both magical scrutiny (such as *discern lies*) and mundane scrutiny (such as using the Sense Motive skill). Someone who closely scrutinizes the target can determine when it is actually telling the truth with a successful Sense Motive check (DC = 15 + your caster level).  
  
As long as you are within close range of the target, as a standard action you can suppress or resume the effects of this spell, allowing you to let the target seem to be telling the truth at some times and still seem to be lying at others.
