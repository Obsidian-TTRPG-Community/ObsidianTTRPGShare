# Revealing Light 

**source**:: Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 31  
**school**:: evocation (light)
**level**:: arcanist 2, bard 1, cleric 2, inquisitor 2, medium 1, oracle 2, psychic 2, skald 1, sorcerer 2, warpriest 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M/DF (piece of a mirror)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: object touched  
**duration**:: 10 minutes/level  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

The touched object emits a shimmering light (as per *light*) that causes shadows to shift constantly in a 20-foot radius. Creatures lose any racial bonus on Stealth checks while in the area, and the light suppresses any bonuses on Stealth checks granted by visual camouflage (such as from camouflage netting^UE^ or the camouflage rogue talent^APG^). The unpredictable light patterns also interfere with spells and effects of the pattern subschool, granting all creatures in the area a +2 bonus on saves against such effects.
