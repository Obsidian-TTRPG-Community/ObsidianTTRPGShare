### Description

This spell functions like *arcane eye*, except that it uses an *ioun stone* as a visible scrying sensor. The *ioun stone* moves at the same rate as an *arcane eye*, and may pass through holes or spaces as small as 2 inches in diameter. It can enter another plane of existence using a *gate* or similar portal, but the caster loses contact with the sensor should this occur. The enhanced *ioun stone* has AC 24, 10 hp, hardness 5, fly speed 30 (perfect), and a +16 Stealth bonus. The stone does not provide you with its normal benefits while you are using it as a scrying sensor.
