### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V

### Effect 

**range**:: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)  
**target**:: you (teleportation) and creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst (burst of flame) (see text)  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex half, see text
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

This spell functions like *dimension door*, except you leave behind a burst of fire. Choose one corner of your starting square. A 10-foot-radius burst of flame explodes from that corner the moment you leave, dealing 4d6 points of fire damage.

## Mythic Damnation Stride 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 90  
The burst of fire created reeks of sulfur and brimstone and also acts like *stinking cloud* (with the same duration as that spell and a separate Fortitude save).  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you bring one unwilling adjacent creature with you. You may bring additional creatures, but each must be adjacent to you and each requires you to expend one additional use of mythic power. These creatures must first attempt a saving throw against the burst of flame and *stinking cloud*, then can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being teleported with you.
