# Reincarnate 

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 331  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: druid 4, hunter 4, medium 4, shaman 4, witch 5

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, M, DF (oils worth 1,000 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: dead creature touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none, see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.  
  
Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.  
  
A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject’s racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. Negative levels equal to or greater than the creature’s Hit Dice are instead applied as Constitution drain (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.  
  
It’s possible for the change in the subject’s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.  
  
For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the next page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.  
  
A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.  
  
A wish or a miracle spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.  
  

## Reincarnation on Golarion 

\>**source**:: Inner Sea Races pg. 193 Death is a natural part of life in the Inner Sea region, but it need not be final. Yet returning to life is not without its perils and peculiarities. While reincarnation is a significant part of the culture of certain races-particularly the samsarans, who reincarnate countless times over the centuries on their slow paths toward perfection and enlightenment-the use of the spell *reincarnate* allows any character to experience this mystical and fundamentally life-changing event. The table of random races presented here expands on the one presented with the reincarnate spell in the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*. At the GM’s discretion, you may use the following optional table when rolling to determine what new body is generated when a *reincarnate* spell is cast. This Golarion-specific table excludes all races that possess racial Hit Dice, but also adds in new races that are relatively widespread and common in the region. Not all of the races presented in this book appear on the following table-androids, for example, are beyond the scope of a *reincarnate* spell to create (although dead androids and wyrwoods can themselves be reincarnated, they have no chance of coming back in the same type of body). Others, such as kasathas and other alien races, are not true natives of Golarion and thus lack the “spiritual weight” needed to be included in a table of reincarnation possibilities. Of course, a result of “GM’s choice” gives each GM the opportunity to break these assumptions about allowed incarnations as she sees fit.  
  
When using these expanded tables, roll first on the Core Incarnations table. This table presents an array of familiar races. Move on to the Other Incarnations table only if directed to do so. This larger list presents a selection of less-common races from across Golarion, some of which might be familiar to the people of the Inner Sea, while others might be almost entirely alien. If the incarnation rolled has multiple ethnicities or heritages-as is the case with aasimar, dhampir, and several similar races- randomly determine which ethnicity or heritage applies to the new incarnation. Ability score modifiers remain the same regardless of the final ethnicity or heritage.

# Cyclic Reincarnation 

**source**:: Arcane Anthology pg. 13  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: druid 6, hunter 6

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, M, DF (oils worth 5,000 gp)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: dead creature touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none, see text
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

This spell allows a dead creature that died no more than 1 year before the casting of the spell to return to life in a body that closely resembles its original body; it functions as *reincarnate* except as noted. *Cyclic reincarnation* returns the dead creature to life in a new body of the same race that the target belonged to in life, and the new body appears physically similar to the creature’s previous one, to the extent that the creature could be easily mistaken for its own offspring or kin. If the affected creature isn’t a humanoid, there is a 75% chance that the creature returns to life as a youth of its race, gaining the young creature simple template instead (or becomes a juvenile, in the case of dragons and other creatures whose power is determined by their age category).  
  
You can use *cyclic reincarnation* on someone who was killed by a death effect or turned into an undead creature and then destroyed, but nonhumanoids so restored always return to life with the young creature simple template (or as a juvenile, in the case of creatures whose power is determined by their age category).

# Reincarnate Spy 

**source**:: Ultimate Intrigue pg. 223  
**school**:: conjuration (healing)
**level**:: druid 6, hunter 6, shaman 6, witch 7

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V, S, DF, M (oils worth 2,500 gp and a possession or piece of the body of the creature to resemble)

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: dead creature touched  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none (see text)
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions as *reincarnate* except that you can cause the new body to resemble a particular creature, matching its age category and sex and rerolling any race result that would be the wrong size category. The subject further gains a +5 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the chosen creature due to similar features, although it might take a penalty for being the wrong race.  
  
The spell automatically leaves you with a small piece of the creature’s new body, typically a lock of hair (useful for *scrying* and other such spells).
