### Description 

You push your hand into the subject, then withdraw an affliction from the body of the sufferer as a tangible object. This extraction appears as a slimy mass of flesh. The target creature is cured as if affected by *remove disease*, *remove curse*, or *neutralize poison*.  
  
In addition, this slimy mass allows you to deliver the affliction to another as a touch attack, as if holding the charge for a touch spell. It has the same effect as the original affliction, with the same saving throw and DC.
