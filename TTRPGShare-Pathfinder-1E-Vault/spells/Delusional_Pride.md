**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 1 minute  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates

### Description 

The target becomes so distracted by an overblown sense of its worth that it takes a -2 penalty on attacks and skill checks. However, this feeling also gives the target a +2 morale bonus on saves against charm and compulsion effects.
