### Casting

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**effect**:: ray of negative energy  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary negative levels (see Special Abilities). Negative levels stack.  
  
Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from *enervation* don't last long enough to do so.  
  
An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 × 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

## Mythic Enervation 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 93  
The number of negative levels inflicted increases to 1d6, and the target is sickened for 24 hours. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d6 × 5 temporary hit points for a number of hours equal to your caster level.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any creature attempting to remove the target’s negative levels must succeed at a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level + your tier).
