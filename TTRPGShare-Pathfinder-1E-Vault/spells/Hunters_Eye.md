### Description 

Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against obfuscating effects, *hunterâ€™s eye* greatly enhances your senses against the target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the see *invisibility* spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on Perception checks to locate the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist, *blur*, *displacement*, *invisibility*, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. This spell provides no benefits to your allies, and no benefits against creatures other than the target.
