# Flashfire 

**source**:: Ultimate Wilderness pg. 231  
**school**:: evocation (fire)
**level**:: druid 3, hunter 3, shaman 3

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**area**:: one 5-ft. square/2 levels  
**duration**:: 1 round/level  
**saving-throw**:: Reflex negates (object) and Fortitude negates
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description 

You cause flames to spring up in the area of effect. These flames deal 1d6 points of fire damage for every 3 caster levels you have (maximum 5d6) to each creature that enters a burning area or begins its turn in the area; these creatures also catch on fire. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save negates the damage and avoids catching on fire. The area and all adjacent 5-foot squares are smoky, providing concealment within. You can concentrate as a standard action to ignite one 5-foot square adjacent to a currently burning square. Heavy precipitation (including *sleet storm*) ends the spell. Strong and severe winds spread each square of *flashfire* downwind by one square each round, but windstorm-force or stronger winds extinguish the fires.
