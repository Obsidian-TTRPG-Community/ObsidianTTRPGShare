# Recoil Fire 

**source**:: Ultimate Combat pg. 241  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: arcanist 2, redmantisassassin 2, sorcerer 2, witch 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (hoof shavings from a mule)

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: 1 firearm  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (object)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (object)

### Description 

The target firearm suddenly fires of its own volition, even if it is unloaded, generating a recoil so great that the wielder or carrier of the firearm must scramble to hold onto it and becomes flat-footed until the start of his next turn. If the wielder is already flat-footed, he is instead knocked prone. If the firearm was loaded, that ammunition is wasted.
