### Description 

A *lesser geas* places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.  
  
The *geased* creature must follow the given instructions until the *geas* is completed, no matter how long it takes.  
  
If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.  
  
If the subject is prevented from obeying the *lesser geas* for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the *lesser geas*.  
  
A *lesser geas* (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by *break enchantment*, *limited wish*, *remove curse*, *miracle*, or *wish*. *Dispel magic* does not affect a *lesser geas*.

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 10 minutes  
**components**:: V

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one living creature  
**duration**:: 1 day/level or until discharged (D)  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

This spell functions similarly to *lesser geas*, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.  
  
If the subject is prevented from obeying the *geas/quest* for 24 hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the *geas/quest*.  
  
A *remove curse* spell ends a *geas/quest* spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. *Break enchantment* does not end a *geas/quest*, but *limited wish*, *miracle*, and *wish* do.  
  
Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as *geas*, while clerics call the same spell *quest*.
