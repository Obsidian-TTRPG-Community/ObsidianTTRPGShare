### Description 

*Draconic reservoir* functions as *protection from energy*, absorbing 6 points of one type of energy damage per caster level (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, maximum 60 points). Each round, as a swift action, the subject can release 1d6 points of the absorbed energy and apply it to any melee attack, as if using an *acidic*, *flaming*, *frost*, or *shock* weapon. The first creature the subject strikes with this attack takes the energy damage in addition to any other consequences of the attack. Releasing energy in this way does not “free up” space to absorb still more energy; the maximum amount of energy the spell can absorb remains fixed. The subject cannot release more energy than he currently has absorbed. Once the subject has absorbed all the energy allowed by the spell, he takes damage as normal from that energy type. Once the energy has been released, the spell is discharged.  
  
*Draconic reservoir* does not stack with *protection from energy*. *Draconic reservoir* overlaps (and does not stack with) *resist energy*. If a character is warded by *draconic reservoir* and *resist energy*, draconic *reservoir* absorbs damage until it reaches its maximum limit.

## Mythic Draconic Reservoir 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 92  
The amount of energy damage the spell absorbs increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points). The energy damage from the weapons improves as if using a *corrosive burst*, *flaming burst*, *icy burst*, or *shocking burst* weapon.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, spending a swift action applies the energy damage to any number of creatures the target hits this round, not just the first.
