### Description 

*Firefall* causes a fire to erupt into a geyser of dazzlingly bright liquid flame. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire larger than a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, but a creature of the fire subtype used as the source takes 1 point of damage per caster level (no saving throw).  
  
The coruscating rain of fire fills a hemispherical burst with a radius of 60 feet. All creatures and objects in the area take 5d6 points of fire damage and catch on fire (*Core Rulebook* 444). Creatures who make successful Reflex saves take half damage and donâ€™t catch on fire. Creatures within 120 feet of the original fire source are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).
