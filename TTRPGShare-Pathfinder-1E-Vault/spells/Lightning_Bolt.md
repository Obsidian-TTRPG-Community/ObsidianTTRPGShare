### Description 

You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.  
  
The *lightning bolt* sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

## Mythic Lightning Bolt 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 100  
The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). Any creature that fails its save is staggered for 1 round.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can bend the line of the spell once up to 90 degrees. Any creature that fails its save is stunned for 1 round.
