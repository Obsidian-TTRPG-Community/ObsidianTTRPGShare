### Description 

You blur the lines between mind and body, reassigning ability damage or drain your target has taken to a corresponding ability score, as per the following table.  
  

|                            |                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Physical Ability Score** | **Mental Ability Score** |
| Strength                   | Intelligence             |
| Dexterity                  | Wisdom                   |
| Constitution               | Charisma                 |

  
The transfer of damage can go either way-you can convert Intelligence damage to Strength damage and vice versa. You can transfer any number of points of damage or drain in a single casting, though only from one ability score to the corresponding ability score. You cannot transfer enough ability damage or drain to reduce an ability score to 0.
