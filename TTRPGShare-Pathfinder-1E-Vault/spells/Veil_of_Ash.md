This spell causes a small cloud of searing, choking ash to appear around the face of the target.

The target must have a discernable anatomy and no more than one head in order to be blinded.

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the ash cloud in 2 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.
