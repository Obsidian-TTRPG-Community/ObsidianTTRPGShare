### Description 

This spell functions like *symbol of death*, except that each creature within the radius of *symbol of exsanguination* begins to bleed uncontrollably and violently from their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, as well as any existing open wounds. Creatures that failed their saving throws immediately take 1d6 points of bleed damage and are sickened as long as they continue to take bleed damage from the symbol.  
  
While a DC 15 Heal check or magical healing can end the bleed damage as normal, the bleed damage and sickened condition begin again each round so long as the creature begins its turn still within 60 feet of the symbol, including if the creature leaves the area and returns. Creatures that succeed at their saving throw suffer no ill effects from the symbol, even if they leave its area and return.  
  
Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of exsanguination* has no hit point limit on the creatures it can affect. Once triggered, a *symbol of exsanguination* remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
Magic traps such as *symbol of exsanguination* are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character who has the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is equal to 25 + spell level, or 28 (27 for a bloodrager) for *symbol of exsanguination*.
