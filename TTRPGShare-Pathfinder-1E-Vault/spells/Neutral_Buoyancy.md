### Description 

The target’s buoyancy becomes and stays neutral, regardless of how dense the target and its gear are. Among other effects, the target neither sinks nor rises when it doesn’t attempt a Swim check, making it easier to stay put while performing demanding actions or when helpless or disabled, and the target can swim up and down with equal ease.
