### Description 

You transform an improvised weapon into an equivalent simple or martial weapon of masterwork quality. This effect does not alter the weaponâ€™s shape or appearance in any way. For example, if this spell is cast on a chair leg, a butter knife, or a pitchfork, the items function as a masterwork club, a masterwork dagger, or a masterwork trident, respectively, but the items look no different than they did before the spell was cast.
