**source**:: Advanced Player's Guide pg. 217  
**school**:: conjuration (darkness)
**level**:: arcanist 2, bard 2, bloodrager 2, skald 2, sorcerer 2, wizard 2

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (coal dust)

### Effect 

**range**:: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**target**:: creatures and objects in a 10-ft. spread  
**duration**:: instantaneous  
**saving-throw**:: Fortitude negates (fatigue only)
**spell-resistance**:: no

### Description 

A shower of iridescent black particles clings to and extinguishes torches, lanterns, sunrods, and similar mundane light sources and dispels any spell of 2nd level or lower with the light descriptor (as *dispel magic*). Creatures in the area must make a Fortitude save or become fatigued.

## Mythic Dust of Twilight 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 92  
A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell must also succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as the *sleep* spell). Creatures that succeed at their saves are merely drowsy (as the *lullaby* spell).  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, add half your tier to the level of light spells *mythic dust of twilight* dispels.
