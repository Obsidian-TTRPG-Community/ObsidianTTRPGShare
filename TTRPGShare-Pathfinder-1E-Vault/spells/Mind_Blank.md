# Mind Blank 

**source**:: PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 313  
**school**:: abjuration
**level**:: arcanist 8, psychic 7, sorcerer 8, witch 8, wizard 8

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**target**:: one creature  
**duration**:: 24 hours  
**saving-throw**:: Will negates (harmless)
**spell-resistance**:: yes (harmless)

### Description 

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic (such as *detect evil*, *locate creature*, *scry*, and *see invisible*). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. *Mind blank* even foils *limited wish*, *miracle*, and *wish* spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as *arcane eye*, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
