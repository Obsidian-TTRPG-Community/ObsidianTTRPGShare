### Description 

Both Quantium and Jalmeray claim that this spell was born in their arcane universities. Regardless of the spellâ€™s origin, it quickly spread throughout the Inner Sea and beyond as spellcasting sword-fighters learned of its existence.  
  
When you cast this spell, you immediately move up to 30 feet in a straight line any direction, momentarily leaving a multi-hued cascade of images behind you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You may make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against any one creature you are adjacent to at any point along this 30 feet. You gain a circumstance bonus on your attack roll equal to your Intelligence or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. You must end the bonus movement granted by this spell in an unoccupied square. If no such space is available along the trajectory, the spell fails. Despite the name, the spell works with any melee weapon.
