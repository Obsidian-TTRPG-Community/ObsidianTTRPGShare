### Description 

As part of the casting of this spell, you must deal 1 point of piercing or slashing damage to yourself to release your blood. This causes you to take 1 point of bleed damage. While the spell is in effect, all sharks, feeders in the depths, and creatures with the blood frenzy ability in the area gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a -2 penalty to AC. This is treated as blood frenzy for the purposes of other feats and effects, and doesnâ€™t stack with the effects of actual blood frenzy. If you cease bleeding, the spell immediately ends.
