### Description 

The blood of the targeted creatures begins to boil. If a target fails its save, it takes 1 point of fire damage per round. This spell has no effect on creatures that don’t have blood.  
  
If a target has the orc subtype, it doesn’t take fire damage and instead gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength.

## Mythic Boiling Blood 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 87  
A target that fails its save takes 1d3 points of fire damage per round. If a target has the orc subtype, it also gains fire resistance 5.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can affect allies as though they had the orc subtype.
