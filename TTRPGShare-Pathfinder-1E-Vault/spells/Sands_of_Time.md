**source**:: Ultimate Magic pg. 236, Osirion, Land of the Pharaohs pg. 27  
**school**:: necromancy
**level**:: arcanist 3, cleric 3, occultist 3, oracle 3, psychic 3, shaman 4, sorcerer 3, spiritualist 3, warpriest 3, witch 3, wizard 3

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect 

**range**:: touch  
**target**:: touched creature or object  
**duration**:: 10 minutes/level or instantaneous (see text)  
**saving-throw**:: none
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You temporarily age the target, immediately advancing it to the next age category. The target immediately takes the age penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for its new age category, but does not gain the bonuses for that category. A creature whose age is unknown is treated as if the spell advances it to middle age. Ageless or immortal creatures are immune to this spell.  
  
If you cast this on an object, construct, or undead creature, it takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) as time weathers and corrodes it. This version of the spell has an instantaneous duration.

## Mythic Sands of Time 

**source**:: Mythic Adventures pg. 107  
You age the target by two categories instead of one. The damage dealt to objects, constructs, and undead increases to 5d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).  
  
**Augmented (8th)**: If you expend four uses of mythic power, the duration changes to instantaneous. If the target is a living creature, its age increases to venerable, regardless of its current age. A non-mythic creature receives no saving throw against this, but a mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save against the spellâ€™s DC to reduce the duration to 10 minutes per level and the effect to two age categories instead of automatically changing to venerable.  
  
If the target is an object, construct, or undead, it takes 30 points of damage per caster level. A mythic creature that succeeds at a Fortitude takes only half damage.
