### Description 

This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a *wall of force*. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the *wall of force* first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
When scribing a *symbol of sealing*, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the *symbol of sealing*, but doing this extends the casting time as described under *symbol of death*. However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned-the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.  
  
A *disintegrate* spell or similar effect can destroy the *wall of force* created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A *knock* spell has no effect on a *symbol of sealing* or its force wall. A *symbol of sealing* cannot be dispelled, but *mageâ€™s disjunction* automatically destroys it.
