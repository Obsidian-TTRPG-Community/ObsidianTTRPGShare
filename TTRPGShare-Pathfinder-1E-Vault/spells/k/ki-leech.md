### Casting

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S

### Effect

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 minute/level (D)

### Description

You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a critical hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can steal some of that creature’s ki. This replenishes 1 point of *ki* as long as you have at least 1 *ki* point in your *ki* pool. This does not allow you to exceed your *ki* pool’s maximum. This ability does not stack with similar abilities (such as the steal *ki* ability of the hungry ghost monk).  
  
This spell has no effect if you do not have a *ki* pool.
