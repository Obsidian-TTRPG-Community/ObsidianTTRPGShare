### Description 

This spell functions like *symbol of death*, except that using the material component, you scribe a *symbol of striking* so it fills a 5-foot square. Once triggered, the *symbol of striking* glows and lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has made a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever comes first. When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence modifier (magus, witch, wizard) or Wisdom modifier (cleric) or Charisma modifier (oracle, sorcerer) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version of you wielding the material component appears to make these attacks.  
  
The symbol attacks any non-attuned creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from the symbol. However, when the symbol first attacks a creature, the symbol must overcome that creatureâ€™s spell resistance or be rendered unable to harm it. The symbol never again attacks such creatures. Further, when the symbol first attacks a creature, a successful Will saving throw allows the creature to see the shadow nature of the attacks and take half damage when such attacks hit.  
  
*Symbol of striking* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.
