# Defensive Grace 

**source**:: Advanced Class Origins pg. 31  
**school**:: transmutation
**level**:: investigator 5

### Casting 

**casting-time**:: 1 standard action  
**components**:: V, S, M (a living fly)

### Effect 

**range**:: personal  
**target**:: you  
**duration**:: 1 round/level (D; see below)

### Description 

Each round you can roll an inspiration die without expending a use of inspiration and gain the result as a dodge bonus to AC for that round. You are immune to precision damage (including the extra damage from the precise strike deed, sneak attack, studied combat, and studied strike).  
  
If a critical hit is confirmed against you, you can dismiss this spell as an immediate action to negate the critical and make the attack instead deal normal damage.
