### Description 

You create an extradimensional link between yourself and one summoned creature you control that allows you to switch places. After casting *master’s escape*, you can teleport to your summoned creature’s space as a swift action, causing your summoned creature to teleport to your former space. If your summoned creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points before you can use this spell’s effect, you can teleport to a space that you can see within 30 feet as an immediate action. After using either of these effects, the spell ends. A summoner can target his eidolon with this spell.
