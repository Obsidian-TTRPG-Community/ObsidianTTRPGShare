### Description 

A giant, glowing symbol of wrath appears below you, forcibly repulsing all nearby creatures. All creatures within the area of effect take 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are subjected to a bull rush that attempts to push them directly away from you. The blast’s bull rush effect has a CMB bonus equal to your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). You are unaffected by both the spell’s damage and its bull rush effect, and may select up to one creature per 4 caster levels to also be ignored by the spells effects.
