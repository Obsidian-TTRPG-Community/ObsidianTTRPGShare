**duration**:: 1 minute/level (D)  
**saving-throw**:: Will disbelief
**spell-resistance**:: yes

### Description 

You cause the target to perceive the world as if in a dream. When the spell ends, the target forgets all identifying details of events that transpired while the spell lasted. The memories were not taken from it; rather, its mind never recorded the memories as real in the first place. If *modify memory* is cast upon it before the spell ends, the target remembers these events. A target under the effect of *lullaby* before this spell is cast applies its penalty to the saving throw against this spell.
