# Description
Commando constructs are elite fighting machines that often operate alone or in small squads. Although they are skilled combatants, these constructs can handle a variety of clandestine activities, including assassination, infiltration, kidnapping, and sabotage. They are most often found wandering the plains of Numeria, or under the service of a local warlord.

 The sample commando construct presented here is built using a terraformer robot  as the base creature. See that entry for full descriptions of its base abilities.
