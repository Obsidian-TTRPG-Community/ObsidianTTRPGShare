# Description
The rare dark folk children born without eyes are assigned to the dark champion caste and begin a life of rigor, privation, and martial training. Their armor is typically bolted to their bodies in sections and removed only rarely. Most other dark folk appreciate the discipline and might of dark champions, but they treat them with wary respect.
