# Description
The ageless monuments and awesome cities of Thassilon rose upon the backs of countless slaves, but none bore the sin-poisoned civilization’s burden more than the giants. Able to perform the work of dozens of human slaves, Thassilon’s titanic servants-hill giants, stone giants, taiga giants, and others-crafted marvels nigh unparalleled in any era before or since, and shaped the face of what is now modern Varisia. Yet as viciously as the runelords worked their slaves and for all they demanded, the giant-crafted marvels were not enough. And thus, working the corrupt rune magic that was theirs alone, the runelords manufactured a damning curse and laid it over their most tireless and effective workers, and in so doing created a new breed of servant: the runeslave. 

Numerous severe-looking runes spark and flicker upon a runeslave’s body, seemingly seared into the creature’s flesh. One of the runes is larger and more prominent than the others-this is always one of the runes of Thassilonian magic. Although a runeslave’s mind is dulled, its muscles bulge grotesquely, as if barely contained beneath a thin layer of skin, and such behemoths move with unnatural agility for creatures of their ponderous size. 

Note that while the runeslave template does make a giant more powerful (and thus increases its CR), few, if any giants would seek to gain a runeslave’s powers. Despite the advantages the runeslave gains, what it loses in free will and longevity typically vastly outweigh the benefits. In combat, a runeslave is deadly and terrifying, but in life, the condition is rightly feared among giants as a devastating and debilitating curse.
