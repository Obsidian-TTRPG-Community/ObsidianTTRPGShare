special_abilities:
  - name: Magic Weapons (Ex)
    desc: A yzobu rider troop’s attacks count as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.
  - name: Mounted Terror (Su)
    desc: Once per round as a free action, a yzobu rider troop can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a single foe that has been damaged by its troop attack. If the troop succeeds at demoralizing a shaken or frightened foe, the foe’s fear level increases by one step.
  - name: Mounted Troop (Ex)
    desc: A yzobu rider troop deals triple its troop damage if it moves at least 10 feet before making a troop attack. The hobgoblins in this troop are Medium creatures, but the troop can fit only through areas that would accommodate their Large mounts.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    desc: A yzobu rider troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop’s space. Creatures in any of these lines take 8d8 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 27 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
