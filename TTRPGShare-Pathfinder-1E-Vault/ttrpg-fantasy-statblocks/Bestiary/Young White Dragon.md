# Description
Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer ferocity. White dragons dwell on remote, frozen mountaintops and in arctic lowlands, making their home in glittering caves full of ice and snow. They prefer their meals completely frozen.
