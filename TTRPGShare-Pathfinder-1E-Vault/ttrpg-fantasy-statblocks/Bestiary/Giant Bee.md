# Description
Like their smaller cousins, giant bees fill their ecological niche by playing matchmaker for a vast array of flowering plant life. As a giant bee feeds on plant nectars, clumps of pollen attach to the coarse hairs covering its body and legs. 

Giant bees grow to approximately 5 feet in length, with a similar wingspan. These creatures weigh 60 pounds and live in their adult form for nearly 10 years. Giant beesâ€™ stingers are not barbed like those of their diminutive counterparts, so these creatures can sting foes repeatedly and do not die after one sting.
