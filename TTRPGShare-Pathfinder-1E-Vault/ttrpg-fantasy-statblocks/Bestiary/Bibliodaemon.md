    desc: When a bibliodaemon hits a creature with its light mace, the target must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be cursed. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that bibliodaemonâ€™s curse for 24 hours. If the bibliodaemon confirms a critical hit with its light mace, the save DC increases by 4, and the curse can affect even creatures that have already succeeded at a prior save against this effect. A creature that fails this save interprets any contract as favorable to itself, even in cases when the contract is one-sided and potentially lethal. In addition, an affected creature takes a -4 penalty on saves against spells and effects reliant on spoken commands or verbal contracts, such as geas. A remove curse or more powerful spell can remove this curse. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Bibliodaemons are daemons that personify death by paperwork. A village that starves due to bureaucracy-delayed aid or an innocent person sent to hang because of a transcription error-these and more are the domain of bibliodaemons. These daemons actively work to ensure such deaths, forging important documents or duping others into deadly contracts.

 A bibliodaemon is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
