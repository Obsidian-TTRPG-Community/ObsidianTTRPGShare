# Description
These alchemists focus their race’s penchant for fire into more productive and efficient means of destruction than mere torches or bonfires. Instead, they hone the craft of concocting bombs, mutagens, and extracts. Though they possess the means of enhancing their physical prowess, many bombardiers forgo imbibing their mutagens prior to battle, believing that increasing one’s weaknesses, even for potential gain in other areas, is a tactical mistake. When the situation calls for it, however, they drink mutagens to increase their physical stamina or ranged accuracy, preferring to decrease their perception and influence before compromising their mental faculties.
