# Description
Swan maidens are fey shapechangers who vow to protect unspoiled wilds from the encroachment of civilization or evil. They live in small flocks along secluded lakeshores. Because stealing a swan maiden’s cloak robs her of her shapechanging ability, most maidens avoid humanoids and take up armor and weapons to defend themselves.
