    desc: A flotsam terror can break apart into a tangle of seaweed and rubbish as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, becoming a swarming mass of Tiny debris. It gains the swarm subtype, its space changes to 10 feet, and its reach changes to 0. In this form, it gains a swarm attack that deals 2d6 points of damage. The flotsam terror gains a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as harmless flotsam while in this form. Creatures can move through the flotsam terror’s space while it is in this form, treating the area as difficult terrain. The flotsam terror can reconstitute as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

# Description
Also known as jetsam swarms, sailor’s bane, and wreck wraiths, flotsam terrors are undead created from the souls of sailors and other sea travelers killed in shipwrecks. Such a soul lingers around the detritus of a shipwreck, eventually coalescing into a flotsam terror. Multiple terrors can spawn from one wreck. They then ride the currents, roaming the seas until they locate other ships. Flotsam terrors are malicious and bitter entities, detesting their fate and intentionally seeking out ships in hopes of causing additional wrecks. The creatures follow and attack any survivors, intent on creating more of their kind.

 A flotsam terror is typically 3 feet tall and weighs up to 50 pounds.
