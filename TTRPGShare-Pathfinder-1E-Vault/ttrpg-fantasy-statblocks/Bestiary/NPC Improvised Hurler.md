tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The monk drinks potions of barkskin and cat’s grace.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: This monk prefers to use improvised weapons like ladders, tankards, and chisels. If he happens upon a particularly effective and sturdy improvised weapon, he applies oil of greater magic weapon before rejoining the fray. In familiar terrain, he tries to stun or trip a foe as a standard action and then uses his abundant step ability to seek cover where he can hide. The dwarf then pelts his adversaries with anything on hand.
