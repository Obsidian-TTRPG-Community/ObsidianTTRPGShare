special_abilities:
  - name: Entrapping Vines (Ex)
    desc: A mythic vrock can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to release a cloud of spores from its body, affecting all adjacent non-demons. The spores deal 2d8 points of damage on the first round as they grow into ugly vines; for the next 10 rounds, they deal 1d6 points of damage and entrap the affected creatures (DC 21, 10 rounds, hardness 5, hp 10). The vines can be destroyed by casting bless on the creatures or by sprinkling them with holy water. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Greater Stunning Screech (Su)
    desc: Once per hour, a mythic vrock can emit a shrill screech. All non-demons within a 30-footradius spread must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If the vrock expends one use of mythic power, any creature that fails its save is staggered for 1d6 rounds after the stun ends. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Manic Dance of Ruin (Su)
    desc: A mythic vrock can expend one use of mythic power to dance and chant as a full-round action, after which it releases a crackling wave of energy, dealing 5d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within 100 feet (Reflex DC 17 for half). Each additional vrock that joins in the dance adds 1 to the DC and an additional 5d6 points of damage, up to a maximum of 20d6. The dance immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the participating vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented from dancing. The save DC is Charisma-based.
