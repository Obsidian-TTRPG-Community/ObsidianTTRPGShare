  - name: Self-Destruction (Ex)
    desc: When a clockwork dragon’s hit points are reduced to 10% of its total (17 in the case of most clockwork dragons) or less but are still above 0, the creature self-destructs on its next turn, bursting into an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals 10d6 points of slashing damage plus 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save is Charisma-based.

# Description
While the clockwork goliaths possess more brute power, clockwork dragons’ powerful breath weapons and mastery of flight make them more versatile and graceful killers. Designed for long flights and missions, the intricate winding mechanism of the clockwork dragon is more efficient than that of other clockwork constructs, partially because it reuses some of the energy generated by its intricate wings and the complex machinery of its breath weapon device. One of the most complicated and subtly crafted clockworks, its many moving parts are fortified by adamantine supports and fixtures, making this killing machine a brilliant mix of intricacy and unyielding terror.

The basic chassis and internal workings of the clockwork dragons are highly adaptable, and many variants of the clockwork dragon exist. Clockwork dragons are typically 20 feet long from snout to the tip of its tail, and weigh nearly 75 tons.
