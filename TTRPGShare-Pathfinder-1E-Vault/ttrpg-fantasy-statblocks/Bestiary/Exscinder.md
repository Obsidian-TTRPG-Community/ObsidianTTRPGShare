special_abilities:
  - name: Censor Text (Su)
    desc: An exscinder can attempt to magically steal or modify any text within 100 feet as a standard action. Against an unattended text, it automatically succeeds. A creature in possession of a text can attempt a DC 22 Will save to negate this ability. A stolen text teleports directly into the exscinder’s hand. A modified text is permanently revised according to the exscinder’s wishes-this change is detectable with magic, but can’t be dispelled or reversed short of a wish or miracle. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Change Size (Su)
    desc: An exscinder can change its form to a Large, Medium, or Small version of itself. This does not change its ability scores; it adjusts only its size (and thus its weapon damage).

# Description
Exscinders are Heaven’s censors, scouring the planes for texts containing information too evil or dangerous to be allowed to exist. Exscinders care little for individual lives or everyday heresies, remaining staunchly focused on protecting mortalkind as a whole from corruption.
