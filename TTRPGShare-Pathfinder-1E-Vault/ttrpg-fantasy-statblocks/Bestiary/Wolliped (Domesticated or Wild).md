    desc: Unless a wolliped is specifically trained for combat (see the Handle Animal skill on page 97 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), its gore is treated as a secondary attack and the creature lacks the trample ability.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    desc: Once per hour, a wolliped can regurgitate the contents of its stomach, spitting the foul material at a single target within 10 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

Believed to be native to the Parapet Mountains, wollipeds were among the first beasts of burden domesticated by Triaxians. Some claim wollipeds werenâ€™t domesticated initially to be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. In any case, Triaxians have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds.
