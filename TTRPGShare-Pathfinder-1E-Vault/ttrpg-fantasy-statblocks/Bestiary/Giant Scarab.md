# Description
Scarabs are small, six-legged insects with sharp protrusions on their front legs that they use for burrowing. They are primarily coprophagous, eating dung for sustenance. An individual scarab often spends days rolling a single ball of dung across the desert until it can find the perfect place to bury it and deposit eggs. Because they burrow underground to create life, scarab beetles are associated with burial rites. Some say scarab beetlesâ€™ connection with the dead gives them powers greater than those of normal beetles, but as of yet there is no evidence this is true.
