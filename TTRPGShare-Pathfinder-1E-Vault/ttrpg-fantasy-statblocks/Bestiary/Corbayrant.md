special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Virulence (Su)
    desc: A corbayrant emits an aura that suppresses defenses against paralysis and poisons. Creatures with bonuses on saving throws against paralysis or poison lose these bonuses while within 30 feet of a corbayrant. This aura doesn't negate general bonuses on saving throws-such as a bonus on all Fortitude saves- and it has no effect on creatures that are immune to paralysis or poison.
  - name: Contagious Paralysis (Su)
    desc: A corbayrant's spines deliver a eldritch paralytic agent. A creature damaged by a corbayrant's spines or by its swallow whole attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 minutes and sprout thorny barbs that can pass on the paralysis to others. A creature that touches a target paralyzed by a corbayrant's spines or strikes the paralyzed target with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 1d6+10 points of piercing damage and is also affected by the corbayrant's contagious paralysis (a DC 22 Fortitude save negates the contagious paralysis but not the damage). A creature affected by contagious paralysis can attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end the effect. When the contagious paralysis ends, the barbs fall off harmlessly and dissolve into rotten splinters. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Plantlike (Ex)
    desc: Although they are magical beasts, corbayrants have many qualities common to plants. Corbayrants breathe and eat, but do not sleep. For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), corbayrants count as both magical beasts and plants.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Sting-injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    desc: A corbayrant's spines are primary natural attacks that deal piercing damage and deliver the corbayrant's contagious paralysis. A corbayrant can hurl up to four spines as a standard action. This attack has a range of 90 feet with no range increment. The corbayrant can target multiple creatures with its hurled spines, but all targets must be within 30 feet of each other.

# Description
An ambush predator that conceals itself among tall trees, corbayrants are bizarre amalgamations of insect and plant. Appearing somewhat like an oversized scorpion with barbed spines in place of claws, corbayrants have an exoskeleton made of thick layers of bark and moss. With their segmented limbs fully extended, their legs resemble tree trunks and their mossy underside blends in with the forest canopy. A corbayrant keeps its long tail curved above its body, its barbed stinger dripping viscous venom like tree sap. Corbayrants lack eyes, but they perceive their surroundings through a combination of sound and changes in air pressure.

 A corbayrant’s spiny forelegs deliver a magical paralytic toxin that causes afflicted victims to sprout barbs that can transmit the paralysis to others. A corbayrant rarely waits for this paralysis to run its course, as it prefers to snatch up paralyzed victims in its large quadrisecting mouth and swallow them whole. The creature’s abdomen contains sharp thorns that exude the same paralytic toxin as its spines, which keep its prey immobile while it is being digested.

 A thin, miasmic cloud surrounds corbayrants. Although visually indistinguishable from ordinary forest mist, this cloud suppresses creatures’ resistances to paralysis and poisons, making the creature a far more effective hunter.

 A typical corbayrant stands 19 feet tall and weighs nearly 3 tons.
