# Description
Seductive enchanters use magic so they can enjoy mortal pleasures. This usually means influencing people to give them things. These wizards can be found anywhere they can get the finer things in life. Many of them become connoisseurs of one particular pleasure, going from place to place and scamming people into giving them the rarest gems or pieces from master artists, or coercing kisses from the most attractive nobles.
