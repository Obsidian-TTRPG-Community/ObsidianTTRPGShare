special_abilities:
  - name: Conductivity (Ex)
    desc: A magical attack that deals electricity damage speeds up a golden guardian (as the haste spell) for 1d4 rounds. A golden guardian gets no saving throw against electricity effects.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    desc: A golden guardian’s body generates intense heat, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples. Creatures attacking a golden guardian with unarmed strikes or natural weapons are also subject to the golden guardian’s heat.
  - name: Molten Destruction (Ex)
    desc: When reduced to 0 hit points, a golden guardian superheats and instantly melts into a pile of molten gold. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius spread take 6d6 points of fire damage; a DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Heat Shimmer (Ex)
    desc: The intense heat radiating from a golden guardian’s body creates a wavering shimmer in the air that makes the construct difficult to see clearly. This functions as a blur spell (CL 8th), except it cannot be dispelled.

# Description
Golden guardians are humanoid automatons formed of iron, steel, and most of all, gold. Their appearance can range from rough, lumpy humanoid shapes to statue-shaped conglomerations of gold coins to exquisitely detailed gilded statues with eerily accurate human faces. Golden guardians are powered by a fiery, molten core of pure gold, which radiates a shimmering heat.

Golden guardians cannot speak, and move with the sound of metal scraping on metal. A golden guardian stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,500 pounds.
