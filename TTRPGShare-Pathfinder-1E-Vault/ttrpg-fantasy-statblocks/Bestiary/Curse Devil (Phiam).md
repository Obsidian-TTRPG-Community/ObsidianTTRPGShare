special_abilities:
  - name: Anathematize (Su)
    desc: Once per day as a standard action, a curse devil can temporarily drop its natural invisibility to reveal its true, horrifying form. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become cursed as bestow curse; additionally, all creatures in the area must succeed at a second DC 16 Will save or have their memories of the event stripped as if by modify memory. The curse devil can resume its invisibility at the end of its turn as a free action. Whether or not the saves are successful, an affected creature is immune to that curse devil’s anathematize ability for 24 hours. If its natural invisibility is negated by other methods, the curse devil can’t use this ability. Those who can see invisible creatures are immune to this effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Broken Curses (Ex)
    desc: When a curse devil dies, any lingering curses or harmful effects caused by the devil are undone as if by a miracle spell.
  - name: Infernal Bond (Ex)
    desc: When a curse devil is created by a lesser or greater devil, its creator forges a magical link between the curse devil and a mortal signed to-or implicated in-an infernal contract, such as a mortal who sold her soul to a devil or the first-born child of a mortal who was promised in an infernal bargain). Thereafter, the curse devil can always find the specified mortal as though guided by a locate creature spell with no maximum range. The specified mortal takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against the curse devil’s anathematize ability and its spell-like abilities.

# Description
Curse devils, or phiams, are constructs of Hell that exist outside the infernal hierarchy. They are forged by more powerful devils to hunt down mortals whose souls belong to Hell. When folk speak of “family curses” or “damned fates,” a curse devil is often pulling strings.

A curse devil is 4 feet tall and weighs 80 pounds.
