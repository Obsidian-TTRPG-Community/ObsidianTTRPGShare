# Description
Magnimar has few laws for a city its size, but it still employs a sizable force of guards, centralized within the towering Arvensoar. Guards walk the streets regularly, policing the various quarters and maintaining peace throughout the city, though the wealthier districts see noticeably more protection than areas such as the Shadow. Magnimar’s city guards are trained to detain criminals and keep the peace without needless violence, using nonlethal force in all but the most extreme cases.
