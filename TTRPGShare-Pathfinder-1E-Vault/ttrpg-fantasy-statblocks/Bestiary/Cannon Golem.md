special_abilities:
  - name: Alloyed (Ex)
    desc: A cannon golem’s slam and cannon attacks count as adamantine, cold iron, and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Blasting Critical (Ex)
    desc: When a cannon golem confirms a critical hit with a slam attack, it can make one cannon attack against that target as a free action (as long as the cannon is loaded).
  - name: Cannon (Ex)
    desc: The golem’s cannon has a range increment of 100 feet and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a ×4 critical modifier. The cannon’s magazine can hold up to 20 cannonballs at a time-reloading a single cannonball into this magazine is a standard action for the golem, while loading a cannonball into the cannon itself to fire it is a swift action; this allows the golem to take two shots per round with the cannon.
  - name: Gun Training (Ex)
    desc: A cannon golem adds its Dex modifier to the damage dealt by its cannon.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    desc: A cannon golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. Any spell with the water descriptor that affects a cannon golem renders its cannon unusable for 1 round (no save).A heat metal spell causes the golem’s cannon to instantly backfire, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the golem and staggering it for 1 round (no save).
