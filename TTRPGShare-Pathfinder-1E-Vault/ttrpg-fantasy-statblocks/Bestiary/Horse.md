    desc: Unless specifically trained for combat (see the Handle Animal skill, a horse’s hooves are treated as secondary attacks.

Horses stand 5 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds.

The statistics above are for a typical riding horse, called by some a “light horse.” Some horses are larger and heartier, bred for labor such as pulling plows or carriages. These horses are called “heavy horses” and gain the following adjustments to the base statistics detailed above.
  - name: Heavy Horse
    desc: : A heavy horse gains the advanced simple template. In addition, it also gains a bite attack that inflicts 1d4 damage, and its hoof damage increases to 1d6. As with a light horse, a heavy horse can be specifically trained for combat with the Handle Animal skill.

Ponies are smaller breeds of horses better suited to halflings, gnomes, and dwarves, but they also make fond pets for humans as well. They stand 3 to 4 feet tall and weigh about 600 pounds.

A light load for a pony is up to 100 pounds, a medium load is 101-200 pounds, and a heavy load is 201-300 pounds. A pony can drag 1,500 pounds.

The statistics presented above are for a typical pony. Tougher ponies with the advanced simple template exist, but are relatively uncommon and, unlike horses, these creatures are not generally called “heavy ponies.” Like horses, ponies can be trained for combat with the Handle Animal skill, and such mounts often serve halflings, gnomes, and other small races as steeds in combat.
