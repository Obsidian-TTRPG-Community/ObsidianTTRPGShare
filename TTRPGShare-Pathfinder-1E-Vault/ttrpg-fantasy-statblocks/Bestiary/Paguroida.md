special_abilities:
  - name: Embedded Magic (Su)
    desc: A paguroida can embed a magic item in its shell as a full-round action. Once the item is embedded, its magic is channeled into the paguroida’s body and the item no longer functions normally. It is not considered to be wielded or worn, and the item functions as though in an antimagic field while embedded in the paguroida’s shell. A paguroida that has embedded magic items with a total caster level that is at least equal to its Hit Dice (11 for a typical paguroida) gains a +4 deflection bonus to its AC and a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A paguroida with embedded magic items whose total caster level is at least twice the creature’s Hit Dice doubles these bonuses and gains the advanced creature simple template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294). A paguroida can remove an embedded magic item as a full-round action, adjusting the total caster level of its embedded items accordingly. The magic item can then be wielded or worn, but it still functions as if in an antimagic field for 1d4 minutes, after which time it returns to normal function.
  - name: Nondetection Aura (Su)
    desc: A paguroida emits an aura out to a radius of 30 feet that makes divination difficult. All creatures and objects within the aura are affected by a nondetection spell that requires a successful DC 20 caster level check to overcome. Creatures or objects revealed to a spellcaster who succeeds at this caster level check remain detectable for 24 hours to that spellcaster, even if the creature or item exits and reenters the aura. A paguroida automatically succeeds at the caster level check to overcome this effect when using its constant detect magic spell-like ability.
  - name: Psychic Magic (Su)
    desc: A paguroida begins each day with a number of PE equal to twice the total caster level of all magic items embedded in its shell. (The statistics above assume that the paguroida has items with a total caster level equal to 11 embedded in its shell.) Removing or adding a magic item after the start of the day does not increase or reduce this number until the next time the paguroida regains PE.
  - name: Undersized Weapons (Ex)
    desc: Although a paguroida is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a result, it wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most paguroidas). Additionally, because it has only one hand-its other appendage is tipped with a massive pincer-a paguroida can wield only a shield or a light or one-handed weapon at a given time.

desc_short: This crab-like creature has the torso and head of a human, one arm ending in a massive claw, and another arm wielding a scimitar. It scuttles on six legs that emerge from beneath a massive shell with glinting metal and gems embedded into its surface.

# Description
Believed to have been created by the aboleths in ages long past as part of the alghollthus’ experiments on the murajau, paguroidas are reclusive, hermit crab-like monstrous humanoids who live in hidden grottoes and seaside estuaries, typically on isolated or remote coastlines. One of their upper limbs terminates in a humanoid hand, while the other ends in a large pincer capable of gripping and crushing prey. A paguroida’s face is similar to that of a crab, with protruding eyestalks and a wide mandible-filled mouth, though its torso is distinctly humanoid in shape and size. A typical paguroida stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.
