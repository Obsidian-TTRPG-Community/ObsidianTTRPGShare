special_abilities:
  - name: Dimensional Bark (Su)
    desc: Up to three times per day, a barrow hound can emit a bark of dimensional energy that sends foes spiraling through time and space. All creatures in a 30-foot cone must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or immediately be teleported 2d6 × 5 feet in a random direction (roll 1d8 to determine the direction, with 1 indicating north and other numbers indicating compass directions going clockwise). The direction is randomly determined for each affected creature. A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space to the determined destination, but must appear on a solid surface capable of supporting its weight. If there is no appropriate destination in that direction, the creature does not teleport at all. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Howl (Su)
    desc: A barrow hound can let out an ear-splitting howl that terrifies creatures in the vicinity. All creatures of 4 or fewer Hit Dice within 120 feet must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same barrow hound’s howl for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
The enigmatic barrow hound is a native to the First World, and can often be found among the shifting forests and untamed woodlands of that realm. It is known to be a noble and obedient creature-a rare trait among the wily fey-and those who command the respect of a barrow hound can rest assured knowing that the beast will protect with its life whatever charge they assign to it. 

 Barrow hounds do not particularly enjoy killing living creatures, and instead prefer to scare them off with their unearthly howls. Failing that, however, barrow hounds are fierce combatants, and their ability to constrict creatures with their prehensile locks makes them formidable foes. 

 Though sometimes summoned to the Material Plane by powerful fey or honored druids to guard some area of great significance, barrow hounds are more often found on their native plane of the First World, particularly in the sprawling forest known as the Evergrove, where they serve as hunting and guard dogs. 

 A typical barrow hound is 14 feet long, stands over 7 feet at the shoulder, and weighs just under 3,000 pounds.
