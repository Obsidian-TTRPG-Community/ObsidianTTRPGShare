tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The druid casts barkskin and bull’s strength.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The druid is well aware of his physical shortcomings, and wild shapes into a Medium air elemental the first chance he gets to escape melee combat. Once at a safe altitude, he casts wind wall and freedom of movement. If still threatened, he casts offensive spells such as flame strike or sleet storm, or uses his Weather domain spell-like abilities. If targeted by spellcasters, he casts fog cloud to obscure vision. If forced into melee, he casts greater magic fang before wild shaping into a Huge animal (preferably a triceratops or an orca).
