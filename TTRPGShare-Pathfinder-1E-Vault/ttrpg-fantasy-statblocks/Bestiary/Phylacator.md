special_abilities:
  - name: Animated Manacles (Su)
    desc: A phylacator can throw a set of masterwork manacles like a masterwork bola. A target tripped by the phylacator’s manacles is also entangled until it slips free of the manacles or breaks them. Manacles thrown by a phylacator automatically expand or contract to fit creatures of any size. As a move action, a phylacator can move a single set of manacles within 180 feet up to 30 feet in any direction, but if a creature is locked in the manacles, the phylacator must succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check against the creature to move it. A phylacator can open or close any number of manacles within 180 feet as a free action, but it cannot open and close the same manacle in the same round.
  - name: Forbearance (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, a phylacator can end one imprisonment effect it previously created. This violently rips the target through the Plane of Shadow to an unoccupied square adjacent to the phylacator, automatically reducing the target to 0 hit points in the process. This is a pain effect.
  - name: Institutionalized (Ex)
    desc: In exchange for its service, a phylacator forms a bond with an institution that consists of 100 or more prisoners. While inside the limits of this institution, it gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge (local), Perception, and Sense Motive checks. It must spend 1 day familiarizing itself with the institution to form this bond; once selected, it loses any bond it had with a previous location.
  - name: Iron Chair (Su)
    desc: Each phylacator is bound to a specific metal throne covered with a thousand iron spikes, in which it must sit, unarmored, for 15 minutes each day. A phylacator that does not perform this ritual loses its regeneration and institutionalized abilities until it can do so. The iron chair has hardness 10 and 500 hit points; if destroyed, a phylacator must spend 1d12 days on the Plane of Shadow to acquire a replacement.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Su)
    desc: A creature that fails its saving throw against a phylacator’s gaze is overcome with submissive hopelessness, taking a -4 penalty to its CMD for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

# Description
Phylacator kytons serve as jailers, torturers, and executioners in the most terrible prisons across the planes. Although a phylacator normally relies on its intimidating presence and booming voice to quell its charges, phylacators also enjoy violence and relish opportunities to quash riots. In combat, a phylacator knocks foes to the ground with its flail and pummels them into submission, relishing the painful feedback it receives when using its weapon. Against fleeing foes, a phylacator hurls manacles it magically animates, incapacitating its foes until it can recover them at it leisure. Since a phylacator is often responsible for keeping prisoners alive, it frequently uses nonlethal tactics-but that doesn’t mean it is any less brutal or efficient in its methods.

 Although a phylacator normally wears armor and draped chains to cover its flesh, its skin is midnight blue in color and has the texture of rough-hewn stone. Phylacators are hairless and their steel-gray eyes lack pupils. They are unceasingly patient and can remain utterly motionless for hours.

 Phylacators stand almost 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 350 pounds.
