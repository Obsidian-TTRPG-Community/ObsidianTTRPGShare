special_abilities:
  - name: Entangling Acid (Ex)
    desc: Any creature that takes acid damage from any of Thuskchoon’s attacks or abilities (whether an extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability) becomes entangled by the thick, sticky acid this qlippoth lord generates. Freedom of movement prevents this entangle effect; otherwise, it persists until a character peels off and discards the acidic sludge; doing so requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Attempting to do so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
  - name: False Intellect (Su)
    desc: In any round that Thuskchoon causes any Intelligence damage to a creature via his swallow whole ability, the qlippoth lord can use that digested intellect to gain the benefits of his intellectual flash ability for 1 round per point of Intelligence damage dealt in that round. This duration stacks if Thuskchoon has swallowed multiple creatures, or if the Intelligence damage continues for more than 1 round.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    desc: A creature that succumbs to Thuskchoon’s horrific appearance has its mind flooded with horrific recollections that may or may not be real, repressed terrors knocked loose and brought to the conscious mind by the presence of the monstrosity that is Thuskchoon. Often these memories are a strange mix of racial memory and flashes from past lives. The victim also experiences genetic reversions. The victim is immediately affected by feeblemind (as per the spell), and its body is deformed and hideously twisted. Select (or choose randomly) from the list of deformities gained from the mutant template (see page 180 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5) to apply to the victim. Alternatively, simply reduce one of the victim’s physical ability scores by 4 points (feel free to devise an appropriate cosmetic atrocity to add flavor to this reduction). The feeblemind effect can be cured normally by any effect that removes that condition (see the spell description for more details), but the mutation is permanent and can be removed only via a miracle or wish spell, or by death and subsequent resurrection. Thuskchoon’s horrific appearance has no effect on creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or 0.
  - name: Intellectual Flash (Ex)
    desc: When Thuskchoon enters combat, there’s a cumulative 20% chance per round that he receives a flash of intellect. Check for this flash at the start of the qlippoth lord’s turn in combat. If the chance succeeds, for that round Thuskchoon loses his nearly mindless weakness and can use his spell-like abilities freely and engage in combat tactics on par with those of a typical human. During that round, Thuskchoon can attempt Knowledge checks untrained with a +20 insight bonus (he retains his -4 penalty from his Intelligence score of 3, so this means his Knowledge checks are attempted with a +16 bonus for this round). The next round, the chance of an intellectual flash occurring is reduced to 0%, but then increases by 20% each subsequent round.
  - name: Nearly Mindless (Ex)
    desc: Thuskchoon’s limited intellect and his overwhelming hunger combine to make the creature nearly mindless in his actions. Unless he uses his intellectual flash ability or gains the benefit of false intellect, he cannot activate any spell-like abilities and his tactical choices in combat are those of a violent animal. While in his nearly mindless state, Thuskchoon gains a +8 bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Trailing Tar (Ex)
    desc: Thuskchoon exudes a thick swath of sticky, tarlike sludge whenever he moves using his base speed. Any square he passes over using this base speed is transformed into difficult terrain for 1 hour. Freedom of movement allows free passage through this sticky terrain, and a dose of universal solvent can cleanse one 5-foot-square area of tar. Spell effects that cleanse an area of filth or detritus can also remove this difficult terrain, provided the spell effect in question is 6th level or higher.

desc_short: This sluglike creature leaves a swath of tar wherever he goes, and his upper body opens into a gaping, sludge-dripping mouth.

# Description
Not all of the qlippoth lords have alien intelligences that outstrip the minds of most mortals. In the case of Thuskchoon, the qlippoth lord’s intellect is replaced almost entirely by a ravenous need to consume and feed. Now and then, the qlippoth lord gains flashes of insight and momentarily comprehends vast puzzles of reality, yet those brief insights fade quickly. These periods of insight are lengthened when Thuskchoon consumes prey, for as he digests flesh, he also digests thought, and can parasitize his victim’s minds in order to act with purpose. 

Thuskchoon’s Abyssal sanctum is a vast warren of tunnels that wind through the depths of the Abyss and connect most, if not all, of the other qlippoth sanctums. Rarely does he spend time in this maze of caves, though, instead aimlessly wandering the depths of the Abyss in constant search of anything to sate his eternal hunger. Now and then, the qlippoth lord blunders through portals that bring his ravenings to other planes, whereupon it is but a matter of time before he is banished or slain and forced to start his wanderings over anew from his sanctum’s heart. 

Thuskchoon measures 40 feet in length and weighs 16,000 pounds.
