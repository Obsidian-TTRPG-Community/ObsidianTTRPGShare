special_abilities:
  - name: Cataclysmic Roar (Ex)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, an abysogh can emit a terrible roar in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this cone take 10d6 points of sonic damage and are deafened and staggered for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates both conditions. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Freedom of Movement (Ex)
    desc: An abysogh is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.
  - name: Living Ammunition (Ex)
    desc: When an abysogh succeeds at a combat maneuver check to initiate or maintain a grapple against a creature two or more size categories smaller than itself, it can hurl the creature anywhere within 60 feet as a free action, though if it does so after maintaining a grapple, it can’t perform any of the actions that can normally be taken as part of maintaining a grapple. Regardless of the trajectory, the hurled creature takes 6d6 points of damage from the collision and falls prone. The creature can attempt a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid falling prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.

 If the targeted square contains another creature, the abysogh makes a ranged attack against the target. A hurled Large creature deals 4d6 points of damage, a Medium creature deals 3d6 points of damage, and a Small creature deals 2d6 points of damage. The abysogh adds 1-1/2 its Strength bonus to this damage. Tiny or smaller creatures don’t deal damage to the target. Whether the attack hits or not, the hurled creature lands in an empty space of the abysogh’s choice adjacent to the target.
  - name: Trembling Earth (Ex)
    desc: When an abysogh moves more than 5 feet in a round, its footsteps send seismic waves rippling across the ground. All creatures at least two size categories smaller than the abysogh that are standing on the ground within 20 feet of the giant at any point during its movement must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or fall prone. The save DC is Constitution-based. The vibrations also suppress tremorsense within the area for 1 round (no save).
  - name: Whirlwind Strike (Ex)
    desc: An abysogh can send multiple opponents flying through the air with its sweeping slams. When an abysogh uses the full-attack action, instead of making its normal attacks, it can perform one awesome blow combat maneuver at its highest base attack bonus against each opponent within its reach. It must attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent. When using this ability, the abysogh forfeits any bonuses and extra attacks granted by feats, spells, or abilities.

desc_short: The footsteps of this pale titan cause the very earth to shudder. Each muscle in its body is pulled taut as if in perpetual convulsion.

# Description
Rather than collecting rocks like ordinary giants, abysoghs enjoy collecting living creatures, and love nothing more than flinging a screaming human or horse at enemies.

Legends tell of a small cult of foolish storm giants who dug around the Pit of Gormuz in a misguided attempt to free lost Ranginori, and struck a flow of horrific blood from Rovagug or one of his spawn. Contaminated by the blood, the cultists emerged as horribly mutated creatures of hate and destruction. Nearly unstoppable in their mindless rage, they now live only to slaughter and destroy.

An abysogh stands at least 40 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 tons.
