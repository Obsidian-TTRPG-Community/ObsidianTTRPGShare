special_abilities:
  - name: Ambush (Ex)
    desc: When a feranth charges, instead of making an attack at the end of the charge, it can instead use its skullsplitting roar ability, although the DC to resist this ability is 4 lower when the ability is used in this fashion.
  - name: Burrowing Charge (Ex)
    desc: A feranth can use the charge and run actions while burrowing.
  - name: Hardened Body (Ex)
    desc: A feranth’s natural attacks count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and hardness.
  - name: Quick Strike (Ex)
    desc: Whenever a feranth successfully dazes a creature using its skull-splitting roar ability, it can make an attack of opportunity against that creature. A feranth can use this ability against only one target per round, no matter how many creatures it successfully dazes.
  - name: Skull-Splitting Roar (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a feranth can unleash a terrible roar, affecting all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Any creatures in the area of the cone must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round and deafened for 1 minute. A feranth can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
A feranth uses its devastating sonic attack to incapacitate foes and follows up with its powerful bite, vicious claws, and sharp horns to tear its prey asunder. This massive ambush predator is covered with hardened ridges and mottled black skin. Its limbs end in powerful claws that it uses to dig through tough terrain. When burrowing, a feranth uses its rear legs to smash the sides of its burrow, collapsing the passage behind it. A feranth’s head is adorned with two massive, forward-facing horns and four bulbous, constantly humming sacs that amplify its mighty roars. A feranth stands 25 feet tall and 40 feet long, and weighs between 9 and 11 tons.
