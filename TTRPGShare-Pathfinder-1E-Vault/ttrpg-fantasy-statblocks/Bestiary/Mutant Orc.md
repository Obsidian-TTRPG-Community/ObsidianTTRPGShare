# Description
When long-term exposure to radiation doesn’t result in a creature’s death, it often mutates the creature into a twisted version of itself. Some of these mutations can be advantageous to the creature; others are unquestionably a hindrance to it. In either case, mutants are plentiful throughout Numeria, especially in the Felldales, where they band together into roving bands of loosely affiliated marauders, traveling the landscape in search of food, shelter, or whatever other things motivate their fractured and warped minds.
