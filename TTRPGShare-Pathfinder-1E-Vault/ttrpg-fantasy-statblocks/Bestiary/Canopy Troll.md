    desc: Thanks to their massive hands, prehensile feet, and dexterous tails, canopy trolls are treated as if they were one size category larger for the purposes of grappling. They gain Improved Grapple as a bonus feat.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: A canopy troll’s tail sting injects a single tumorous lump of its own regenerating flesh into its target. On a failed Fortitude save, this tumor grows beneath the victim’s skin, sprouting bristly hairs and stubby teeth that cause debilitating pain for its host. The sickened condition lasts 2d4 days before the mass dissolves, though a host can attempt a Fortitude saving throw each day to overcome the pain and ignore the condition. Alternatively, the tumor can be removed with a successful DC 20 Heal check.

Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 3 rounds; effect sickened for 2d4 days; cure special.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    desc: Canopy trolls live and fight in tangled piles and are adept at swarming foes. Up to two canopy trolls can share the same square at the same time. If two canopy trolls in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.

# Description
One of the most ravenous dangers of the Fangwood are the arboreal canopy trolls, who bound through the treetops in great troops, scavenging fruit and nuts and descending on much larger prey to tear it limb from limb. They share the legendary durability of larger trolls, and plummet fearlessly from great heights to take prey by surprise, often breaking bones only to heal by the time they begin to feed. These injuries rarely set properly, leaving most canopy trolls in constant pain, worsening their already vicious attitudes. Often underestimated, canopy trolls rely on great numbers and their ability to coordinate en masse, overwhelming prey by sheer numbers as they drag it kicking and screaming into their chaotic, howling maws.

Canopy trolls stand 3-1/2 feet tall, and have prehensile tails nearly twice that length. Their densely muscled bodies weigh as much as 150 pounds.
