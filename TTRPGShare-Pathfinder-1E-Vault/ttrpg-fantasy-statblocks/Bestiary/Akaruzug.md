special_abilities:
  - name: Soul Engine (Su)
    desc: An akaruzug draws the energy it requires to function from a living creature crucified upon its frame. An active akaruzug (or another creature working with an inactive akaruzug) can spend 1 minute to bind a helpless or willing creature to the construct. Once the victim is restrained, the akaruzug can attempt to draw the creature’s soul into it once per round as a free action- the victim can resist with a successful DC 24 Will save. On a failure, the victim dies and the akaruzug becomes active. If the body crucified upon an active akaruzug is removed, the soul within the construct is freed and the akaruzug deactivates after 1d4 rounds. An akaruzug’s victim cannot be resurrected while its soul is trapped within the construct, but destroying an akaruzug releases a trapped soul. While an akaruzug is active, attacks and effects directed specifically at the victim crucified to the akaruzug treat the attack or effect as if it targeted the akaruzug instead. However, a creature can attempt to remove a crucified body from the construct, but doing so first requires the creature to successfully pin the akaruzug. Once this occurs, the creature can attempt a combat maneuver check to wrench the body free. On a success, the corpse is removed and the akaruzug deactivates in 1d4 rounds. A deactivated akaruzug can take no action other than to attempt to draw in the soul of a creature crucified on its body to reactivate itself. It does not have an Intelligence score while deactivated, nor does it gain the benefit of any of its feats or skill ranks. It can’t fly or move at all, and loses all benefits of its soul shield defensive ability. It retains its lawful evil alignment while deactivated. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soul Shield (Ex)
    desc: As long as an akaruzug is active, it gains bonus hit points equal to its Charisma modifier × its Hit Dice (80 hit points for a typical akaruzug), and gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier to its Armor Class (+4 for a typical akaruzug).
  - name: Soul Slave (Sp)
    desc: Using a trapped soul, an akaruzug can manifest a ghostly representation of its victim to attack its enemies. A soul slave appears as the akaruzug’s victim did in life and wields a weapon favored by that individual, but otherwise functions as per spiritual ally cast by a 20thlevel caster (and, as such, has an attack of +24/+19/+14/+9 and deals 1d10+5 points of force damage on a hit).
  - name: Soul Steal (Su)
    desc: An akaruzug can draw additional soul energy into itself. Once every 1d4 rounds, the construct can unleash a blast of soul essence that seeks to flense the life force of any living creature within a 20-foot burst. Any living creature in this area must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. A victim can remove those negative levels 24 hours later with a successful DC 24 Fortitude save. Each time an akaruzug successfully uses this ability, it regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the number of creatures successfully affected by soul steal (regardless of how many negative levels any one creature suffers). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unhallow (Sp)
    desc: An akaruzug emanates a 40-foot aura of unholy energy, as per unhallow. The construct’s creator determines what, if any, additional spell effects are tied to the akaruzug’s unhallow aura at the time of its creation. The construct benefits from any spell effects tied to its unhallow aura. Common choices are darkness, detect good, freedom of movement, and invisibility purge. If this effect is dispelled and the akaruzug uses the spell-like ability to reactivate the effect, it also reactivates the associated spell effect (if any) set by its creator.

# Description
Akaruzugs are blasphemous constructs coveted by those who revel in the torment of their victims. Crafted in the appearance of grim, towering angels and creatures of warped beauty, these creations stand in mockery of light, life, and all that is good. By their very existence- powered by souls trapped in torment-they spread death and despair.

 Most akaruzugs are 15 feet tall or larger, and weigh upward of 3 tons, depending on the materials used in their creation.
