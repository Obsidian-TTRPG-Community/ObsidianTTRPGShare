tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The monk drinks his potions of barkskin and protection from energy (fire) if he has had time to study his foes’ weaknesses. When fighting in cramped or narrow areas, he instead drinks his potion of invisibility and coats an area of the floor with his salve of slipperiness. He then waits for foes to enter the greased area before attacking.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The monk uses his kama in conjunction with Spring Attack and Improved Trip to knock foes prone, potentially using the kama’s ki focus special ability to channel his Stunning Fist. If he has successfully tripped foes with his salve of slipperiness, he activates his slippers of spider climbing so he doesn’t have to cross the slippery floor, and uses flurry of blows with his shuriken. If outnumbered, he uses his elemental gem and flanks with the earth elemental.
  - name: Base Statistics
    desc: Without barkskin and protection from energy, the monk’s statistics are Immune disease, poison; AC 28, touch 24, flat-footed 25.

# Description
Sometimes adventuring monks return home to serve their communities as chiefs, lawgivers, and protectors. Such towns and villages are thus far more dangerous to assault than one might expect.
