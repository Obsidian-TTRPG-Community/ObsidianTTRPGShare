special_abilities:
  - name: Destructive Attacks (Ex)
    desc: An abrikandilu’s natural attacks can threaten and confirm critical hits against objects. In addition, an abrikandilu gains a +5 racial bonus on Strength checks to break or destroy objects.
  - name: Hatred of Mirrors (Ex)
    desc: An abrikandilu loathes the sight of its own reflection. Using a mirror grants a +5 bonus on Intimidate checks against an abrikandilu. An abrikandilu adjacent to a mirror or attacked by a mirror-carrying creature (at the GM’s discretion, some shields could be considered mirrors) must attempt a DC 15 Will save at the start of its turn. If it fails, it must focus all of its actions that round on attempts to destroy the mirror.
  - name: Mutilation (Su)
    desc: An abrikandilu’s bite causes horrific and hideous wounds that not only mar beauty but supernaturally diminish a creature’s sense of self-worth. A creature bitten by an abrikandilu must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or gain a -1 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. This penalty stacks, up to a -5 penalty, and it lasts even after the wounds are healed. The penalty slowly fades with time, diminishing by 1 every 24 hours until it reaches 0. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Known as wrecker demons, abrikandilus delight in destroying beauty, be it by rending a fine painting to shreds, reducing a magnificent statue to rubble, or scarring a lovely face. Abrikandilus are formed from the souls of mortals who vandalized art or defaced objects of exquisiteness, particularly those whose acts of destruction were born from jealousy. All abrikandilus loathe only one thing more than beauty-their own reflections. Curiously, the faces of other abrikandilus do not vex a wrecker demon, but the sight of its own deformed shape drives an abrikandilu into a furious, brutish anger, impelling it to focus all of its energy on breaking the object, usually a mirror, in which it can see itself.

Abrikandilus are often used as ground troops in demonic wars, for they are excellent grunts on the battlefield and don’t require weapons or armor to excel at combat. Their penchant for demolishing works of art functions as an additional demoralizing element in battle, for even when abrikandilus are defeated, the damage they have dealt endures as a constant reminder of the value of what they destroyed.

An abrikandilu stands 4 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
