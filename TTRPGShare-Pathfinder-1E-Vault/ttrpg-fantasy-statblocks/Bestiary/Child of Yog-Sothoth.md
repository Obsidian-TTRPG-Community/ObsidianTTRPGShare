# Description
Creatures born of mortal flesh infused with the essence of the outer god Yog-Sothoth, these deviant children are often tasked with preparing the world for further incursions from other dimensions or agents of the Elder Mythos. Traditionally, the process of creating a child of Yog-Sothoth involves a blasphemous ritual that uses a mortal creature (typically a human) as an incubator. For the purpose of this ritual, gender is irrelevant. Giving birth to a child of Yog-Sothoth is always fatal. In most cases, the ritual results in the birth of twins-one a child of Yog-Sothoth, which can pass for a time as a member of the race of the creature in which it incubated, and one that cannot. Those twins that inherit a monstrous appearance take more after the Outer God itself in form, and are known as the spawn of Yog-Sothoth (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 251).
