special_abilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    desc: A humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. These spawn are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive -2 hp per HD, and only drain 1d2 points of Constitution on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become free-willed wraiths. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Constitution Drain (Su)
    desc: Creatures hit by a wraithâ€™s touch attack must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    desc: A wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    desc: A wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    desc: Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a wraith, unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.

# Description
Wraiths are undead creatures born of evil and darkness. They hate light and living things, as they have lost much of their connection to their former lives.
