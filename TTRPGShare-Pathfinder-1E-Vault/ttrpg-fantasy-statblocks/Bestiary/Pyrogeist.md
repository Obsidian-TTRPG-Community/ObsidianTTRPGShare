special_abilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: A pyrogeist can spit a cone of spectral fire that damages living creatures. When a creature fails a saving throw against the pyrogeist’s breath weapon, the creature’s flesh ignites in ghostly flames for 2d6 rounds or until the pyrogeist is destroyed. While the creature is affected by the flames, it is illuminated as though under the effects of faerie fire and takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage at the start of each turn. Subsequent breath weapon attacks don’t increase this damage but can extend the duration. An affected creature can attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save as a full-round action to quench the flames. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Pyrokinetic Whirlwind (Su)
    desc: A pyrogeist can transform into a spectral whirlwind (as per the universal monster rule) to entrap its victims. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take 10d6 points of negative energy damage each round. A pyrokinetic whirlwind does not create a swirling cloud of debris when it touches the ground.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    desc: A pyrogeist that is destroyed restores itself after 2d4 days, forming near its mortal remains. To permanently destroy a pyrogeist, its corpse must receive proper burial rites, including a sprinkling of holy water.
  - name: Soul Consumption (Su)
    desc: The spirit of a creature that dies while subject to a pyrogeist’s pyrokinetic whirlwind is trapped within the pyrogeist (as per soul bind) until the pyrogeist is destroyed or chooses to set it free. The spirit remains trapped whether or not the pyrogeist is in whirlwind form.

# Description
Pyrogeists are the burning ghosts of arsonists and pyromaniacs who were killed in the fires they started. Whether the pyrogeists’ deaths were accidents or suicides, the horribly painful and often humiliating deaths create pyrogeists from the arsonist’s or pyromaniac’s soul. A pyrogeist is a mass of spectral fire that emits no heat and damages only living creatures. A large face floats upon its surface, resembling a twisted mockery of the person the pyrogeist was when alive. A pyrogeist haunts the area surrounding its remains and is consumed with a desire to immolate others. A pyrogeist most often haunts its victims with terrifying illusions before engulfing them and adding their souls to the creatures’ perpetual torment.
