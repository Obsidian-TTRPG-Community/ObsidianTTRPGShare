  - name: Disease (Ex)
    desc: A black shuck’s bite inflicts a wasting disease on those lucky enough to survive its initial attack. 

Shuck’s Kiss: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 18; onset 1 day; frequency 1/hour for 6 hours; effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Green-Eyed Gaze (Sp)
    desc: Those who meet a black shuck’s accursed eye can find themselves changed by the experience. Three times per day, a black shuck can cast its gaze upon a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be struck with a curse as though affected by a bestow curse spell (CL 9th). The type of curse is fixed and unique to each black shuck, and once assigned, it can’t be changed; thus, one particular black shuck’s curse might reduce an opponent’s Strength score by 6, while another’s might inflict a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. Whether or not a creature fails its save against a black shuck’s green-eyed gaze, that creature can’t be affected by that black shuck’s gaze again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Black shucks are monstrous hounds that haunt the countless footpaths and byways threading through lonely coastal regions and sweaty fenlands. Some say black shucks are grotesque children born of witches who consort with forest demons, while others believe them to be the remains of witches burned alive in marshy terrain. These theories are likely born of the undeniable affinity the dog-creatures have with witches, and the hounds often masquerade as lonely travelers, lost and afraid in the wilds, thanks to their ability to take on the form of such woebegone souls. However, some tales contradict this entirely, telling of black shucks that take care of travelers who cross wild places alone and take vengeance on those who would harm defenseless wanderers. Many suspect that these latter stories are spread by the monstrous canines themselves when in human form and desperate for a meal.

 Many black shucks live lonely lives, shunning civilization and those who hunt at its fringes, but others are found in the company of hags and witches, and some are able to leech greater powers of witchcraft from long association. Sometimes a coven attaches itself to a black shuck and uses it as a guide or hunter, or it might unleash a black shuck on a small coastal village as a distraction from some grander scheme.
