special_abilities:
  - name: Entropic Breath (Su)
    desc: Instead of a line of acid, a woundwyrm can exhale a 30-foot cone of acid fog (as the spell) that persists for 1 minute. Any creature that begins its turn within the entropic breath becomes confused (Will DC 25 negates) for as long as it remains within the cloud and for 1d6 rounds thereafter.
  - name: Maw of the Abyss (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, a woundwyrm can attempt to suck creatures and unattended objects in a 15-foot cone into a vortex in its maw. This acts as a drag combat maneuver (CMB +30) against creatures, and acts as a Strength check with a +10 bonus to break objects. Unattended objects weighing less than 100 pounds are automatically drawn into its maw. Creatures and objects alike take 1d12 points of sonic damage per round within the cone. While using this ability, a woundwyrm cannot speak, use its breath weapon, or make attacks or attacks of opportunity with its bite attack.

# Description
Woundwyrms are ferocious predators native to the corrupted landscape of the Worldwound. They are equally at home in sea and sky, above the ground and below it. Oozing deliquescence seeps from between their cracked, rocky scales, and a constant fume of rainbow hues drifts out of their gullets, save when they inhale and ingest the very substance of disintegrating reality.
