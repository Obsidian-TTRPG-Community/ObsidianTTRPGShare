special_abilities:
  - name: Landslide (Ex)
    desc: When a sturzstromer runs, it can create an avalanche 1d6×100 feet wide along the path which it moves as a free action. The sturzstromer must be in an area of natural rock, soil, or sand and moving downhill, though even gentle slopes are sufficient, and it can use this ability only if it took sonic damage within the past round or if it used its landslide or rumble abilities in the previous round. Each creature caught in the avalanche can attempt a DC 26 Reflex save to halve damage in the bury zone or negate damage in the slide zone. The sturzstromer is unaffected by its own avalanche. The save DC is Strength based.
  - name: Mountaineer (Ex)
    desc: A sturzstromer takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics or Stealth checks when moving across steep slopes, rubble, or scree. In addition, a sturzstromer can hide in rocky terrain, even if that terrain provides no cover or concealment.
  - name: Powerful Swarm (Ex)
    desc: A sturzstromer adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on swarm damage rolls, and it is treated as a Large creature for the purposes of its rock throwing and trample abilities.
  - name: Rumble (Ex)
    desc: As a full-round action, a sturzstromer can create a rumble that shakes the ground and air in a 120-ft. radius centered on the sturzstromer (the sturzstromer still makes a swarm attack at the end of this round). A creature that starts its turn in the affected area must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or be unable to move. A creature that fails this save by 5 or more is knocked prone; a flying creature falls instead. Casting a spell in this area requires a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + the level of the spell being cast). All other concentration checks in the area have their DCs increased by 5. The DC of Perception checks is likewise increased by 5. The effects of this ability last until the start of the sturzstromer’s next turn. The save DCs are Strength-based.

# Description
Sturzstromers, also known as living landslides, are the elemental incarnations of earth in motion, from crushing rockfalls to landscape-altering avalanches. A sturzstromer consists of hundreds of stones, each moving of its own volition. When at rest, the stones lie atop one another; when the sturzstromer moves, the stones roll and churn, drawing smaller pebbles and dirt into their mass. Some observers are able to discern faces in the textures and colors of these rocks.

 The individual rocks that compose a sturzstromer are roughly a foot in diameter, though often irregularly shaped, and weigh approximately 80 pounds each. Altogether, a sturzstromer weighs around 12 tons, and when formed into a pile, the peak reaches 5 feet high.
