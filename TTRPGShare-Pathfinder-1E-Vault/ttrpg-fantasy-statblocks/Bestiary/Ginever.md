    desc: A ginever’s unpredictable swaying movements carry it out of harm’s way, granting it a luck bonus to Armor Class and CMD equal to its Constitution modifier.
  - name: Fortifying Gaze (Su)
    desc: A ginever’s gaze dramatically increases the potency of alcoholic liquids in a 30-foot cone. Inebriated creatures (either independently intoxicated or affected by the ginever’s inebriate attack) that meet the ginever’s gaze must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or gain one of the following conditions of the ginever’s choice: confused, fascinated, or prone. The effect lasts 1d6 rounds. Alchemical and magical liquids in this area of effect are transformed into alcohol for 1 hour, rendering them inert; magic items can resist this effect with a successful Fortitude save. A ginever can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
  - name: Inebriate (Su)
    desc: A ginever can infuse a living creature’s body with alcohol with a successful touch attack, imposing the sickened condition for 1d6 hours. Each additional touch after the first deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage; this Dexterity damage heals immediately once the sickened condition is removed. A creature can stave off the effects of a touch attack with a successful DC 15 Fortitude save, but on a success it gains no immunity against future inebriation attempts.
  - name: Vicious Sobriety (Ex)
    desc: A ginever’s volatile blood is vulnerable to effects that sober a creature. A delay poison or polypurpose panacea sickens a ginever for 1 hour, while a neutralize poison spell staggers it for 1 hour. In either case, a ginever can negate the effect with a successful Fortitude save.

# Description
Ginevers are cruel human-seeming creatures suffused with liquor and spite. Sometimes called “gin devils,” they haunt dive bars and tumbledown slums, living in the shadow of civilization. They are eager carnivores, and while they can sate themselves on any meat, they prefer the taste of flesh marinated for months in sweet, soothing alcohol-a diet that frequently brings them into contact with the dregs of society.

Ginevers are newer arrivals in Taldor, apparently hailing from Casmaron where they have hunted for thousands of years. They claim to be the sacred children of a vile foreign god of fermentation, though Qadiran tales describe them as bandits and vagabonds cursed for their gluttony. Given that ginevers are both argumentative and prone to exaggeration, the truth of their origins is likely lost to history.

Their near-human appearance allows ginevers to blend into society, avoiding notice so long as they control their appetites and avoid scrutiny. With this natural camouflage, they may have dwelled in city shadows for far longer than is known, only emerging in greater numbers as Taldor declines. While a ginever’s gaze can transform even water into some form of alcohol, the magically created spirits are of low, burning quality, and so what little coin the ginever collects is quickly spent on high-quality ales, liquors, and wines.
