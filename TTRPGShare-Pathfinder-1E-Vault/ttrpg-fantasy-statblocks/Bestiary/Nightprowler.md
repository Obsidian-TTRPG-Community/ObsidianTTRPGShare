special_abilities:
  - name: Creeping Dark (Su)
    desc: The nightprowler’s natural attacks leave a stain of dark shadows that linger in and around the wounds, known as the creeping dark-this condition can be resisted with a successful DC 20 Fortitude save. If the victim fails, it becomes staggered for 1 round, after which the creeping dark affects the victim further by preventing healing and hampering vision. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by the nightprowler’s creeping dark must succeed at a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. As long as a creature suffers the creeping dark, its vision is obscured with shadows as well-all creatures gain a 20% miss chance from attacks by the victim. The creeping dark is a curse effect that lasts until removed or until all damage afflicting the victim is healed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shadowpounce (Su)
    desc: Nightprowlers have the pounce ability, and when they use this ability, they can also make rake attacks. Up to three times per day when a nightprowler pounces from an area of dim illumination, it generates a shimmering aura of false images that grants it a 50% miss chance, as if under the effects of a displacement spell, for 1d4 rounds.

# Description
Only a fool would underestimate the danger presented by the hateful nightprowler, despite its position as the least powerful of the undead monsters collectively known as nightshades. The bestial nightprowler is a fearsome opponent armed with the same cruel and calculating intelligence possessed by all nightshades.

Nightprowlers are feline quadrupeds that seem to be composed of living shadow. Their eyes, like the eyes of all nightshades, glow with red light. A nightprowler is 16 feet long from head to tail and weighs 8,000 pounds. Nightprowlers have all the nightshade traits found on page 308 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, except that they have darksense out to only 30 feet.
