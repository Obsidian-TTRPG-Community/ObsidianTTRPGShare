special_abilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    desc: A ravener behemoth looks like a rocky hillside or small mountain when at rest. It takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks.
  - name: Demolishing Attack (Ex)
    desc: A ravener behemoth that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.
  - name: Mighty Roar (Su)
    desc: Every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a ravener behemoth can issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of greater shout. This attack deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 20d6 against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. Creatures exposed to the sonic attack can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save (DC 30). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Rock Hurling (Ex)
    desc: Because of their immense hunger, ravener behemoths often ingest ore-laced rocks to fill their stomachs with longer-lasting sustenance. When faced with dangerous opponents outside its reach, a behemoth may regurgitate these rocks and grind them into smaller shards with its hardened teeth. It then spits forth these shards one at a time as boulders weighing between 60 to 80 pounds. A ravener usually carries enough rocks in its stomachs to make up to 4d6 boulders in this manner.
  - name: Shock Wave (Ex)
    desc: As a full-round action, a ravener behemoth can hammer the ground with its feet and generate a localized tremor that rips the ground, knocking down smaller creatures and creating difficult terrain in a 100-foot radius centered on the behemoth. This shock wave lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures in the affected area cannot move or attack. They must also succeed on a DC 38 Reflex save or fall prone. Any spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    desc: A ravener behemoth can swallow a snatched opponent of Huge size or smaller with its bite attack by making a successful grapple check. Once swallowed, a victim suffers 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage per round from one of the behemoth’s 5 stomachs. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 33 points of damage to a stomach (AC 27). Once the creature exits, that stomach regenerates 15 hit points per round. A ravener behemoth may gorge itself upon multiple creatures, shunting each victim to a different stomach each time. Each of a behemoth’s 5 stomachs can hold 1 Huge, 4 Large, 16 Medium, 64 Small, 256 Tiny, or over 1,000 Diminutive or smaller creatures.

    desc: 78
desc_short: The ground quakes as a colossal, elephantine beast of rocky, armored plates presses forward. Elaborate horns crown its head, and multiple rock-encrusted tusks jut from its toothy maw. With a bellowing roar, the creature shakes its massive head in challenge, then paws the ground and charges.

# Description
Ravener behemoths walk the land as the ultimate consumers of all things. This includes every manner of beast, plant, and mineral caught in their path. They indiscriminately fill their five ever-hungry stomachs by cutting wide swaths through tangled jungles, digging through mountains for precious ores, and razing settlements and strongholds to get at those sheltering inside. Sometimes they even ply shallow coastal waters, capsizing ships to feast upon their crews and any other predators drawn by the smell of blood in the water.

Monstrously massive, a ravener behemoth stands nearly 60 feet tall on four thick, trunk-like legs and measures up to 80 feet long. Multiple horns and tusks sprout from its face and head, helping it root through even the hardest soil and rocks in search of food. It quickly reduces anything stronger into rubble with its earth-shattering roar and stomping feet. A rocky hide grown from the many minerals it routinely consumes protects it from harm even as lichen, small plants, and trees take root along its back, out of reach of its ravenous mouth. Divine blessings bequeathed by the gods ensure only the most powerful spells or adamantine weapons can lay a behemoth low. As a result, the ravener behemoth fears nothing and eats everything.
