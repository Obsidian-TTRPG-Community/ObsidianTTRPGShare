# Description
Bone priests are undead servants of evil gods, condemned to continue serving for decades or centuries after death. In life, bone priests were acolytes or underpriests who failed at some difficult test or fell in battle against powerful enemies of the faith. Their dark gods have rewarded their fanaticism by giving another chance to demonstrate their worthiness.

Bone priests retain the spellcasting ability and some of the domain spells they possessed in life. A typical bone priest casts spells as a 3rd-level cleric and has the bonus spells of one of the domains it had originally-usually Darkness, Death, Destruction, Evil, or Madness (the bone priest presented here possesses the Madness domain).

While bone priests occasionally arise with no outside intervention other than the will of their gods, they are normally created through a profane ritual that culminates in the casting of a create undead spell by a caster of at least 11th level.
