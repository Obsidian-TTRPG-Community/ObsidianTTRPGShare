special_abilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a sea linnorm can expel a 120-foot line of intense stored bioelectricity, dealing 26d8 points of electricity damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 34 half). A secondary discharge arcs off each target that fails its save, striking the nearest creature within 30 feet as long as that creature has not already been targeted by the breath weapon or another discharge. Secondary discharges do not cause tertiary discharges. The bioelectricity overwhelms the nervous systems of living creatures, causing any living creature that takes damage from the linnorm’s breath weapon to be stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 34 Fortitude saving throw negates the stunning effect. Creatures struck by a secondary discharge receive a +4 bonus on this saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Curse (Su)
    desc: When a creature slays a sea linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of crushing depths.

 Curse of Crushing Depths: save Will DC 32; effect creature takes 3d6 points of damage every round while fully submerged in water, as though suffering water pressure damage, regardless of the creature’s actual depth and bypassing any magical protection against water pressure (such as freedom of movement or life bubble). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lure (Su)
    desc: As a free action, a sea linnorm can light the dangling lures on its head; any other creature within a 120-foot radius that can see the lure must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. In addition to the regular effects of being fascinated, a creature affected by this ability also takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against the sea linnorm’s breath weapon. Regardless of the preceding interactions between the sea linnorm and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view the sea linnorm who has fascinated it as a potential threat until that sea linnorm actually attacks-allowing it to approach without breaking the fascination effect. Once a creature succeeds at its saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the same sea linnorm’s lure ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 34; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 8d8 points of electricity damage, 1d6 Dex drain, and 1d6 Con drain; cure 3 consecutive saves.

    desc: 90
desc_short: This unfathomably large serpent sports a distinctly draconic face. Its body is deep, blackened gray with swatches of crimson. An entrancing set of lures dangles off its face, each glowing with a pulsating orange light accented by regular electrical discharges.

# Description
Few, if any, linnorm breeds are more reclusive than the sea linnorm. These immense specimens of primeval draconic lineage dwell in the deepest underwater trenches of the world, blending into their surroundings thanks to their darkened scales. A sea linnorm’s distinctive facial lures attract all manner of sea life, which the linnorm promptly feasts upon before returning to its lair. Luckily for all nonaquatic civilizations, sea linnorms rarely leave the ocean depths they call home.

 A typical sea linnorm grows up to 55 feet long and weighs around 14,000 pounds. It is believed that sea linnorms are effectively immortal, with the oldest recorded sea linnorms surviving well over 5,000 years.
