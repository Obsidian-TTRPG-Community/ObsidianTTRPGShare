    desc: A suture vine can sense badly wounded creatures, including those at less than half their normal hit point total or suffering from bleed damage, as if it had the scent ability.
  - name: Seal Wound (Ex)
    desc: A suture vine instinctively latches on to a creature that suffers from bleed damage or is at less than half its normal hit point total. When it attempts to seal wounds in this way, it must make a normal vine attack but gains attach as per the universal monster rule. If it successfully attaches to the target (dealing damage as normal), any bleed damage currently suffered by the target immediately ends. The suture vine remains attached for 24 hours, gaining nutrients from sipping at the victim’s blood but never enough to cause any further damage. The vine drops off automatically once a target has no hit point damage or 24 hours have passed, whichever comes first. A suture vine can seal wounds in this manner only once per day.
  - name: Vine (Ex)
    desc: A suture vine’s vine attack is a primary natural attack that deals piercing and slashing damage.

# Description
Suture vines are thorny, symbiotic organisms that snag rides on wounded animals, seek out open wounds, and knit those injuries closed-all while absorbing fairly harmless amounts of blood. Local animals often recognize suture vines, both avoiding them as food and seeking them out when wounded. A suture vine that goes without feeding for a week or more sometimes resorts to ambushing small prey.
