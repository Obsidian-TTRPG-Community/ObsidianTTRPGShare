special_abilities:
  - name: Close Ranks (Ex)
    desc: A hobgoblin phalanx troop can adopt a defensive position as a move action. This doubles the troop’s shield bonus to AC and grants it DR 5/- until the beginning of its next turn. While adopting this defensive posture, the hobgoblin phalanx troop’s speed is reduced to 5 feet.
  - name: Tripping Spears (Ex)
    desc: Hobgoblin phalanx troops are adept at using their spears to knock creatures off their feet. The troop’s troop attack gains the trip weapon quality.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    desc: A hobgoblin phalanx troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop’s space. Each creature in any of these lines takes 4d6 points of piercing damage per line that hits it (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.

# Description
Hobgoblin soldiers who excel in Ironfang Legion regiments are promoted to serve in the Ironfang Phalanx. These soldiers are in much better physical condition than typical Ironfang Legion soldiers and are trained in specialized shield and spear techniques, allowing them to erect a nearly impenetrable shield wall while still keeping their spears up and ready to strike.
