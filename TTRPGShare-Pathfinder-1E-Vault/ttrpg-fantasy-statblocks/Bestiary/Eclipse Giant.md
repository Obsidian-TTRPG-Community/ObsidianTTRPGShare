special_abilities:
  - name: Eclipse Empowered (Su)
    desc: When an eclipse giant is in the presence of, and can see, either a solar or a lunar eclipse, it is affected as if subjected to a greater heroism spell (CL 20th) for as long as the eclipse lasts. As eclipse giants rarely watch where they’re going, they learn to avoid obstacles by instinct; an eclipse giant adds its Wisdom modifier on Reflex saves, even when there is no eclipse.
  - name: Imbue Rock (Su)
    desc: An eclipse giant can imbue a thrown rock, casting either its heal or harm spell-like ability just before it throws the rock. If it imbues the rock with harm, the rock targets touch AC, and a creature hit by the rock attack is also affected as if it were the target of the harm spell. If the giant imbues the rock with heal, any creature that catches the rock with the rock catching special ability is affected as if it were the target of the heal spell. If rocks so imbued either miss the target (in the case of a harm-imbued rock) or are not caught (in the case of a heal-imbued rock) they lose the spell effect.

# Description
While these massive giants might appear brutish, they are actually esoteric wanderers and thinkers who take very little notice of the world around them. Instead, their attention is fixated on the heavenly bodies, as they search for the empowering presence of solar or lunar eclipses. While in their search for such cosmological events, eclipse giants are uncaring and may be obliviously destructive, as they are quite large, and they don’t watch where they step. While in the presence of an eclipse, however, an eclipse giant becomes truly active, unlocking an inspired inner self that varies from giant to giant. While one eclipse giant might enter a violent frenzy and rage against the world and other creatures, another might produce a fragment of writing that will one day become one of the greatest plays of her generation, and another might solve a complex formula that predicts the celestial movements of the planets.

 Eclipse giants stand 40 feet tall and weigh 30,000 pounds.
