special_abilities:
  - name: Creeping Cold (Su)
    desc: A tundra blight’s stings deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. In addition, this cold clings to the target and continues to deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage each round at the start of the affected creature’s turn. This creeping cold effect can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any magical healing. This additional cold damage does not stack with multiple stings.
  - name: Curse of Winter (Su)
    desc: A creature struck by a tundra blight’s sting attack must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or gain vulnerability to cold. Creatures immune to cold damage that fail this save do not become vulnerable, but are instead no longer immune to cold (they cannot then be made vulnerable to cold from this curse, as its effects do not stack in this manner). This curse persists until it is removed. This is a cold curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Frozen Domain (Su)
    desc: A tundra blight’s domain is always treated as being one category colder than the region would otherwise dictate (see page 442 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). If a region is normally treated as extreme cold, it deals 1d6 points of lethal damage per round of exposure instead of per minute. Anyone attempting a saving throw against the effects of these cold temperatures or a saving throw against cold effects takes a -4 penalty on the save within a tundra blight’s frozen domain. When a character attempts to cast any spell with the fire descriptor in this domain, she must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check or the spell is negated when it is cast.
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    desc: A tundra blight can navigate icy surfaces as if under the effect of spider climb. It can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to attempt Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.
