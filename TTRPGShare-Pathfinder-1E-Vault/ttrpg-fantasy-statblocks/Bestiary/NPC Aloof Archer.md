# Description
An aloof archer is disdainful of the archery skill of non-elves. Despite their heavy armor, aloof archers are remarkably stealthy. Unlike the elven scouts who move through the brush and harass invaders, these archers make up the ranged support of elven armies, firing over their comrades’ heads into the thick of enemy forces, creating a hail of deadly arrows.
