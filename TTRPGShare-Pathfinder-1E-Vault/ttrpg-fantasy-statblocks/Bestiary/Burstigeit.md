# Description
Burstigeits were created by the dwarves generations ago to serve as beasts of burden. Bred to withstand the hardships of the Darklands, these pack animals are an integral part of dwarven culture, especially in communities that rely heavily on trade with surface dwellers.

 Burstigeits are sturdy, quadrupedal mammals with broad shoulders. Like boars, burstigeits have thin tails that hang halfway to the ground; tough, bristly hair on their backs; and tusks jutting from their lower jaws. While vaguely similar to massive boars, their hind legs are longer and thicker than those of their porcine cousins. Burstigeitsâ€™ hooves are also sharper and stronger than those of a boar, letting them climb nearly as well as mountain goats.

 A typical adult burstigeit stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 1,600 pounds.
