special_abilities:
  - name: Alchemical Bombardment (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a siege alchemist troop can target up to 3 squares within 40 feet with a barrage of alchemical bombs. This attack deals 10d4 points of acid or fire damage (as selected by the troop) to all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 26 half). A creature within the area of more than one burst must attempt separate saves against each. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Alchemical Revitalization (Su)
    desc: Three times per day as a swift action, this troop can grant itself fast healing 15 for 3 rounds.
  - name: Firedrake Spout (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, the siege alchemist troop spews forth large gouts of fire from its incendiary siege engines. This attack takes the form of a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone (as selected by the troop). Targets in the area take 20d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 26 half); those who fail their saves also catch on fire. A siege alchemist troop produces enough alchemical ammunition to use this ability 10 times each day. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

# Description
Most members of this troop are supplied with chain shirts, longswords, and bandoliers of acid and alchemistâ€™s fire. As their creations are jury-rigged spontaneously, capturing a usable firedrake (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 163) after defeating one of these troops is rare.
