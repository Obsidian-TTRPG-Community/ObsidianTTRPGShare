    desc: Bite or claw-injury; save Fortitude DC 20; onset 1 hour; frequency 1 day; effect 1d3 Constitution damage plus sickened and shaken; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Droning (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a druj nasu can beat its wings in such a way that the sound they make resembles the droning of millions of buzzing flies. This sonic effect extends out to a 30-foot radius, though a creature can still hear the cacophony from a distance without being affected. Creatures in the area take a -4 penalty on Perception checks involving hearing, and all creatures in the area have a 25% chance each round of being nauseated for 1 round. Any creature subject to the nauseating effect of this ability can negate the nausea with a successful DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. In addition, any creature casting a spell in the area must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + the level of the spell being cast) or lose the spell. After initiating this effect, a druj nasu can maintain the effect each round as a free action and can dismiss it as a move action.

# Description
Foul corruptors of the dead, druj nasus are divs that haunt funeral pyres, mausoleums, and burial sites to steal corpses. They represent the uncleanness of the body and corrupting forces that can prevent a creature’s proper passage into the afterlife. Some scholars claim that in ancient times these creatures’ interference caused numerous cultures to alter their practices regarding burial.

When a druj nasu was found near a body that was to be buried, the body would be considered unclean. An unclean body couldn’t be buried and the sacred flames of a funeral pyre would only spread the taint to the winds, so some ancient people would then carry the corpse up the side of a cliff or mountain and have the birds and other animals clean the flesh from the bones before the deceased could be interred with the necessary rites to ensure a proper passage into the Great Beyond.

Unlike other corpse thieves, druj nasus don’t take the bodies of the deceased in order to feast upon the rotting flesh. The divs do this to spite the survivors and bring greater grief and sorrow to the family and loved ones of the dead. After pilfering the bodies, the divs watch from afar as the grieving family sinks deeper into sadness. They then animate the stolen remains and, since they have no innate ability to influence these creations, use their command undead spell-like ability to send the shambling corpse back to prey upon its former loved ones. In this way, druj nasus disrupt polite society and commit one of the ultimate cultural taboos.

Because druj nasus, like all divs, are a scourge on humanity’s accomplishments, these foul fiends are a constant target of good faiths. They are particularly hated by followers of Pharasma because of their treatment of corpses and proclivity for animating the remains they steal. Druj nasus generally ignore Pharasmins, however, and instead focus on their own mockery of the living. Because of an unknown, ancient conflict in Kelesh, druj nasus have a strong hatred for Sarenrae and her worshipers, going so far as to single them out in combat and steal away the bodies of the clergy and faithful. Sarenrae’s devoted find combating these divs frustrating due to their immunity to fire.

A druj nasu stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs a slight 100 pounds.
