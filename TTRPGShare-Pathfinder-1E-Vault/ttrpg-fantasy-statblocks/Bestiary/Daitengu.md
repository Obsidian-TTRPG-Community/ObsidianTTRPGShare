    desc: Once per week as a standard action, a daitengu can bestow its mastery of greater fighting arts upon a creature it touches.

Upon being touched, the target gains that feat as a bonus feat for a number of days equal to the daitengu’s Hit Dice. A daitengu with 15 or more Hit Dice can grant two feats with this ability, while a daitengu with 20 or more Hit Dice can grant three.

# Description
Legendary tricksters and teachers, fonts of serenity and masters of destruction, daitengus live far from civilization, where they spend most of their time in meditation. Some say the first daitengus arose from the spirits of tengus who didn’t deserve punishment in the afterlife, but who also saw no appeal in the afterlife’s rewards. 

A daitengu stands 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Daitengus’ most prominent features include bright red skin, crow-like wings, and prodigious noses.
