special_abilities:
  - name: Advanced Hive Mind (Ex)
    desc: As long as there are at least two chrestomaths or caulborn within 300 feet of each other, if one creature in the group is aware of a particular danger, they all are. No creature in the group is considered flanked or flat-footed unless all of them are.
  - name: Cooperative Scrying (Sp)
    desc: Three or more caulborn or chrestomaths who maintain physical contact can scry on a place or creature as if using the scrying spell (DC 20), but with no limit to the spell’s duration so long as at least three of the participants involved continue to touch and concentrate. This ability functions at caster level 7th (or at the highest caster level available to the most powerful participant in the group). The save DC is Charisma-based, adjusted by the modifier of the participant with the highest Charisma score.
  - name: Mind Flood (Su)
    desc: A chrestomath can target any creature it detects with its thoughtsense ability with a deadly psychic attack, flooding the target creature’s head with so much obscure knowledge that it drives the target insane. Any creature affected by the mind blast must make a successful DC 19 Will save or take 1d6 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage and be confused (as per the spell confusion) for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Psychic Deflection (Su)
    desc: A chrestomath adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC. In addition, all caulborn (though not other chrestomaths) within 300 feet of a chrestomath gain half of this deflection bonus as well, with the effects stacking with those from other chrestomaths and the caulborn’s own psychic deflection ability. These bonuses cease when the chrestomath is unconscious.
  - name: Racial Memory (Ex)
    desc: As a full-round action, any caulborn within 300 feet of a chrestomath may access the latter’s racial memory to gain half the chrestomath’s Knowledge skill bonus as a bonus on its own Knowledge check. In addition, the chrestomath instantly acquires any piece of information learned by any caulborn that comes within 300 feet of it. This information may then be shared by any other caulborn and chrestomaths with 300 feet.
  - name: Thoughtsense (Su)
    desc: A chrestomath notices and locates living, conscious creatures within 60 feet just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Spells such as nondetection or mind blank make an affected creature undetectable by this sense.
spell-like_abilities:

# Description
The caulborn are a race of extraplanar scholars that wander between worlds in search of esoteric knowledge, literally consuming the thoughts and memories of other races. While the most common caulborn are the humanoid versions (Bestiary 3 48), there exists a second kind as well: the bloated and blind intelligences called chrestomaths, sometimes referred to as living libraries, or simply “brain-sacks.”

Though they appear to be little more than giant amoebas barely able to move themselves, chrestomaths are a vital part of caulborn society. From their fleshy prisons, these powerful psychic intelligences help to shield and organize their humanoid servitor-siblings, occupying a position in caulborn society somewhere between brute resource and honored elder-and sometimes something close to a living divinity. Even more importantly, however, chrestomaths are the keepers of a caulborn hive’s massive racial memory, the living storehouses of everything its members have ever experienced, as well as the memories and concepts they’ve stolen from others. Indeed, it’s possible that the memories contained within a single chrestomath may stretch back millennia, all the way to the race’s mysterious origins.

A typical caulborn chrestomath is a wet, squishy sack of flesh roughly 5 feet in diameter, and weighs 500 pounds, though older and more advanced versions can grow far larger, taking up entire buildings with their fetid bulk. These more advanced versions sometimes appear almost larval in form, and may possess levels in spellcasting classes, using spells such as mage hand to affect their surroundings.
