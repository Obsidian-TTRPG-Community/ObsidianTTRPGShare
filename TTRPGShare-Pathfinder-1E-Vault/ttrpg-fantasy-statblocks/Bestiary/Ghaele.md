special_abilities:
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    desc: In humanoid form, a ghaele’s gaze attack slays evil creatures of 5 HD or less (range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates, shaken for 2d10 rounds on a successful save). Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be shaken for 2d10 rounds. A creature that saves against a ghaele’s gaze is immune to that particular ghaele’s gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Light Form (Su)
    desc: A ghaele can shift between its solid body and one made of light as a standard action. In solid form, it cannot fly or use light rays. In light form, it can fly and gains the incorporeal quality-it can make light ray attacks or use spell-like abilities in this form, but can’t make physical attacks or cast spells. This ability otherwise functions similarly to a bralani’s wind form ability.
  - name: Light Ray (Ex)
    desc: A ghaele’s light rays have a range of 300 feet. This attack bypasses all damage reduction.
  - name: Spells
    desc: Ghaeles cast divine spells as 13th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.

# Description
Ghaeles are the most knightly of the azatas, hunting fiends, dragons, and undead with equal vigor. Most appear like idealized humans or elves and are quick to smile-and equally quick to strike against those they perceive as wicked.
