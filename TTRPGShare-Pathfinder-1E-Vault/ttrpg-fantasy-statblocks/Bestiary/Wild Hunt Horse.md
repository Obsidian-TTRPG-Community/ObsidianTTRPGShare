special_abilities:
  - name: Bewildering Hoofbeats (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a wild hunt horse can make it seem as though hundreds of horses are approaching from all directions. All creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to the bewildering hoofbeats ability of all wild hunt horses for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Deafening Cry (Su)
    desc: As a standard action up to three times per day (but no more than once every 1d4 rounds), a wild hunt horse can emit a thundering cry. All creatures in a 30-foot cone emanating from the horse take 10d6 points of sonic damage and are deafened for 1 minute. Creatures that succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save take half damage and are not deafened. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Rider Synergy (Su)
    desc: When a wild hunt horse carries a rider with the wild hunt subtype, the two act as one. If either the rider or the mount would take damage, the rider and mount decide how to divide the damage (typically splitting it equally). Additionally, the rider’s movement as a part of the horse’s overrun combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless that movement would also cause the horse to provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Wild Hunt Link (Su)
    desc: A wild hunt horse increases the speed of all creatures in its wild hunt link by 30 feet. This increase is an enhancement bonus. It also grants the members of its link the effects of freedom of movement.

# Description
When they are not participating in a hunt, wild hunt horses enjoy constructing complicated courses through land and sky and racing each other for ever-changing stakes.
