    desc: As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, an Abaddon gigas can drain the souls from all living creatures within 60 feet that are not native to Abaddon. Such creatures must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels.

 If even one creature is affected, the Abaddon gigas gains fast healing 15 for 15 rounds. If a creature dies from an Abaddon gigas’s energy drain special attack, energy drain spell, or devour souls attack, the Abaddon gigas devours that creature’s soul, gaining the benefits of death knell at a caster level equal to the dead creature’s HD. Such a creature cannot be raised or resurrected by any means until the Abaddon gigas is slain. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Abaddon gigas are megalithic extraplanar giants that roam Abaddon and embody the same vile energies that permeate that plane. Their cruel forms and unusual powers give them nefarious reputations, and few giant hunters-even among those who traverse the Great Beyond-would willingly seek out one of these monstrosities.

An Abaddon gigas stands over 50 feet tall and weighs 30 tons, not including the weight of its enormous armor.
