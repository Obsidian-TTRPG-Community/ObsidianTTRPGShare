special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Fate (Su)
    desc: A dunagh merged with or within 120 feet of its ward radiates an aura of fate to a radius of 20 feet. Enemies within this aura must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack, a skill check, or a saving throw) and take the lower of the two results. Allies designated by the dunagh in this aura likewise roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll, but can take the higher result instead. This is a mind-affecting morale effect that doesn’t work on fey. A dunagh can suppress and reactivate this aura at will as a free action.
  - name: Dunagh’s Curse (Su)
    desc: Any creature touched by a dunagh must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be afflicted with the dunagh’s curse. Whenever the cursed creature rolls a d20, it treats any roll of 20 as a roll of 1 instead. The cursed creature cannot take 20. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Dunaghs, like most kami, are guardian spirits native to Tian Xia. Unlike others of their kind, however, dunaghs long ago attached themselves to caravans coming over the Crown of the World, eventually establishing themselves in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, where they’re most likely to be found today. Attracted by a family’s or clan’s intense devotion to a single structure or holding, the dunaghs serve as guardians of family homes, watchful protectors of both the structures and those who live within them.

Most dunaghs prefer to remain anonymous, going about their business when residents are not present. They occasionally assist “their” family by tidying up the house, locking doors, or shutting windows left open during the cold months.

When a family line watched over by a dunagh comes to an end, the dunagh falls into a bleak depression and remains fixated on the family’s last place of residence, becoming a spiteful spirit that forcibly evicts anyone else who tries to take up residence or otherwise trespass upon its ward.

Dunaghs prefer to stay merged with their wards, but in their visible forms, they take on appearances similar to ghostly versions of those people they guard.
