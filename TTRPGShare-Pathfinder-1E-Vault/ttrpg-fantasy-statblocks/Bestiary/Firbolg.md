# Description
Although they are giants, firbolgs are crafty, cautious, and reclusive. They have learned to distrust most other humanoids except elves, and dwell only in remote places far from civilization’s encroaching grasp, amidst fey and spirits of nature. They live in small, close-knit clans that tend to occupy one large, wooden house surrounded by a field kept for harvest. To supplement the food they grow, they wander the surrounding territory in small gangs hunting and gathering.

 Unlike most giants, firbolgs do not raid indiscriminately and do not solve all their problems with force and violence. If pressed into battle, they are cunning combatants who make good use of the terrain, and generally do not kill unless provoked. While they rarely raid, firbolgs love duping smaller creatures out of their food and treasure. Alone or in small groups, they disguise themselves as hapless mountain folk, comely youths, or foreign wanderers to engage in confidence schemes and practical jokes against humanoid neighbors. Firbolgs back up their trickery with their natural magic and incredible strength. Most who encounter a firbolg are never aware of the giant’s true nature.

 In their normal form, firbolgs look like oversized humans. They wear their hair long and free, and many decorate their skin with intricate designs picked out in blue woad.

 Most firbolgs carry their possessions with them in great sacks. Typically, a firbolg’s sack contain several throwing rocks, the firbolg’s personal treasure, and a selection of mundane items stolen, bartered, or otherwise acquired from those the firbolg has recently encountered.
