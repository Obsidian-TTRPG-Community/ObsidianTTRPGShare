  - name: Multiplication (Su)
    desc: When a multiplying skeleton is reduced to 0 hit points, its bones reform 1d4 rounds later into two smaller multiplying skeletons with half the Hit Dice of the original. Each resulting multiplying skeleton continues to reform into smaller and smaller sizes. A multiplying tyrannosaurus skeleton reforms into two Large skeletons with 9 HD each, each of which then reforms into two Small skeletons with 4 HD each. When these four Small skeletons are killed, the skeleton no longer multiplies and is finally destroyed.
  - name: Powerful Bite (Ex)
    desc: A multiplying tyrannosaurus skeleton applies twice its Strength modifier to bite damage.

# Description
A multiplying skeleton reassembles itself into smaller skeletons when it is destroyed. As these smaller skeletons are themselves destroyed, they continue to multiply into even more skeletons. Once the skeletonâ€™s Hit Dice can no longer be halved or the resulting skeletons would be Tiny or smaller, the skeletons are finally destroyed. Multiplying skeletons can be created using animate dead, but they count as twice their normal number of Hit Dice per casting.
