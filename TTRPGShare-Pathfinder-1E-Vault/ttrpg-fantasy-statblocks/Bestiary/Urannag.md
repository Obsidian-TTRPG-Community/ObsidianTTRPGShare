special_abilities:
  - name: Encage (Ex)
    desc: As a swift action, an urannag can encage a creature that shares its space and is not aware of it or a helpless creature it has entrapped. The target treats the urannag’s space as difficult terrain, and cannot move out of that space unless it succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save. Each round a creature remains encaged, it takes 2d6 points of slashing damage. A creature can try to escape by attempting a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check (DC = the urannag’s CMD) as a full-round action, or it can try to smash through a cage wall. These walls have an Armor Class of 22, hardness 10, and 22 hit points. A wall with a hole smashed in it automatically repairs itself. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Exposed Mechanisms (Ex)
    desc: Although an urannag is a construct, it can be harmed by the methods used to disable traps. A successful DC 20 Disable Device check targeting an urannag (a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity) deals damage that bypasses the urannag’s DR equal to 3d6 + the character’s total ranks in Disable Device. Additionally, the urannag is staggered for 1 round (DC 16 Fortitude negates the staggered condition).
  - name: Living Trap (Ex)
    desc: Defensive abilities that apply to traps (such as trap sense) apply against an urannag’s attacks.

# Description
Urannags have long vexed scholars, some of whom contend that they’re creatures, while others argue that they’re complex traps. In truth, they’re both-an unsettling example of how reality on the Abyss doesn’t match mortal expectations. An urannag behaves like an ambush predator, yet has no need for sustenance and is driven to f lense prey out of innate sadism.
