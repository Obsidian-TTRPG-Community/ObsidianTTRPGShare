# Description
Shaitans are boastful and proud genies from the Plane of Earth with flesh of metal, gems, or stone. A shaitan stands about 11 feet tall and weighs roughly 5,000 pounds.

Some shaitans are noble. Often called pashas, they have 18 Hit Dice and gain the spell-like ability earthquake, usable once per day, as well as the ability to grant up to three wishes per day (nongenies only). A noble shaitan’s caster level for its spell-like abilities is 18th. Noble shaitans are CR 13.
