# Description
As large as a wolf, this bulky, massive cricket has spines on its legs, back, abdomen, and head. These crickets are generally not hostile, but they protect their burrows against invasion. When agitated, a giant ground cricket secretes yellowish-green blood from its joints. This blood has a foul odor that wards off predators. Giant ground crickets stand about 2-1/2 feet tall, are approximately 5 feet long, and weigh roughly 80 pounds.
