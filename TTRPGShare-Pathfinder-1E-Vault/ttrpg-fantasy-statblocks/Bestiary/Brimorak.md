  - name: Flaming Weapon (Su)
    desc: As a free action, a brimorak can cause a single wielded melee weapon to deal 1d6 additional points of fire damage on a successful hit. This fire damage stacks with any fire damage that the weapon might also deal. The weapon loses this ability if it leaves the demon’s grasp.
