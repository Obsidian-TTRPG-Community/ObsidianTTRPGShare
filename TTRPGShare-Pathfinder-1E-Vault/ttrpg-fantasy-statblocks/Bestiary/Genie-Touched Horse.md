# Description
Legends hold that in the distant past, genies gifted certain Keleshite tribes with the companionship of a powerful race of equine mounts. Exactly what these mysterious creatures originally were is now lost to time, but their descendants exist still in the form of four distinct breeds of supernatural steeds known as genietouched horses.
