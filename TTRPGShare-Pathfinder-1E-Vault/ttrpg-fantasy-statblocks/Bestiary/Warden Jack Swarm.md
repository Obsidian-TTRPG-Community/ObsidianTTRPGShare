    desc: Any living creature damaged by a warden jack swarm when its spikes are retracted must make a successful DC 12 Reflex save or fall prone. The save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Tower Access (Sp)
    desc: This specific warden jack swarm can cast open/close as a move action on any door within area P. Circumstances that prevent open/close from functioning normally also prevent this ability from working. This ability is as much a feature of the building as it is the swarm; therefore, it does not function on containers or in any other building besides the tower.
  - name: Wounding Spikes (Ex)
    desc: Any living creature hit by a warden jack swarm when its spikes are extended also takes 1 point of bleed damage.

# Description
The warden jack swarm comprises thousands of Fine steel ball bearings that move in electro-thaumaturgical cohesion, making a clicking or clinking sound as it moves. Each sphere can extrude sharp spikes, which essentially transforms it into a swarm of caltrops. The creature can navigate uneven terrain, roll up hills and very sharp slopes, and flow around and between obstacles. The warden jack swarm has one severe limitation: it cannot climb a 90-degree angle. It can roll down steps but not climb them, and it can be trapped in a pit. It can sense the topology of the ground, allowing it to generally avoid pits. In this encounter, the warden jack swarm cannot scale the large rock piles or the steps, although it can roll around the rocks and up the slope alongside the steps. It can also flow through the ankheg nymph tunnels and move underground at a depth of a few feet below the current elevation. When the swarm flows underground, it reveals the location of one of the tunnels’ access points, but if the PCs have not noticed the other holes, they may not know where the swarm might emerge. While underground, the swarm can determine the PCs’ location using its tremorsense.

 The swarm is programmed to attack humanoids in a restricted area but not wildlife or other creatures. The swarm does not interpret monstrous humanoids like skum as legitimate targets-perhaps an oversight by the swarm’s programmer.
