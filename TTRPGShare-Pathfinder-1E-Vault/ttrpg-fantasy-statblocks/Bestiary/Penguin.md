# Description
Many varieties of penguins exist, though most display similar characteristics. The penguinâ€™s most distinctive trait is the tuxedo-style coloration of its feathers, which acts as camouflage while the penguin hunts for fish underwater; the black back and flippers allow the penguin to blend in with the water when viewed from above, while its white belly matches the bright sky when seen from below.

 A penguin of the most common variety stands roughly 3 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds. Larger species of penguin can grow to heights of 4 feet and weigh as much as 100 pounds.
