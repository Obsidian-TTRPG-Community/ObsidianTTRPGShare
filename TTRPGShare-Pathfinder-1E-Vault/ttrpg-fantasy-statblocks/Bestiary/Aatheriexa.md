  - name: Tentacles (Ex)
    desc: An aatheriexa’s barbed eyestalk tentacles must all strike at a single target, but they do so as a primary attack. The tentacles deal bludgeoning and slashing damage and grant the aatheriexa a +8 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks.
  - name: Withering (Ex)

This is a poison effect and the save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Aatheriexas were once a race of conquerors and slavers, but since the destruction of their homeworld, the survivors have wandered the cosmos. Exceedingly cruel, they find perverse pleasure in tormenting those they capture, using them as disposable bodyguards or subjecting them to sadistic magic experiments.

 An aatheriexa’s fleshy pink center is roughly 2 feet in diameter, and features a maw of gnashing teeth. Its grasping eye-tentacles hang down like the leaves of a weeping willow and extend its effective diameter to 5 feet. Aatheriexas weigh approximately 150 pounds.
