special_abilities:
  - name: Boot Stomp (Ex)
    desc: A winter redcap wears heavy iron boots with spiked soles that it uses to deadly effect in combat. These boots give the winter redcap a kick attack that it can make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action or as part of its movement, just as if it had the Spring Attack feat.
  - name: Heavy Weapons (Ex)
    desc: A winter redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty.
  - name: Irreligious (Ex)
    desc: Bitter and blasphemous, winter redcaps cannot stand the symbols of good-aligned religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a holy symbol, any winter redcap that can see the creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become frightened for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A winter redcap who successfully saves is shaken for 1 minute.
  - name: Red Cap (Su)
    desc: A winter redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a winter redcap gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls (included in the above totals) and fast healing 3. These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not transferable, even between other redcaps. A winter redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of work, but until the winter redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the winter redcap helped to kill, the cap does not grant its bonuses.

desc_short: From his snow white beard and blue, frost-covered face to the wicked look in his frozen eyes, this little humanoid betrays a cruelty that only winter itself can match.

# Description
Infused with the primal power of winter’s chill, a winter fey possesses the power to freeze its victims with a mere touch. It is said that this wintery power freezes the heart of any normally good fey, corrupting the creature’s nature and infusing it with hatred and spite. While a winter fey is visually recognizable as being a variant of its normal counterpart, its personality is decidedly altered. Whereas most fey are merely capricious and whimsical, winter fey take pleasure in causing pain and suffering. A winter fey is the same size as its normal counterparts, but it typically weighs a bit more because of the ice crusting its body.
