# Description
The heir apparent has been groomed to rule since birth, yet aspires to an even greater destiny. She welcomes the obligations of a ruling queen, and hopes to accomplish deeds of great heroism, justice, and mercy during her time on the throne. She is normally accompanied by guards (warriors 3) or officers (aristocrats 6).

Some of her remaining wealth is in the form of royal regalia, such as a circlet, and is easily recognized as royal property.
