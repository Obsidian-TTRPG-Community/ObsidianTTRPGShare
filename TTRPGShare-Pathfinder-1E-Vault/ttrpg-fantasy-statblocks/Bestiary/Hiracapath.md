special_abilities:
  - name: Glorious Nimbus (Su)
    desc: A hiracapath sheds the blinding light of righteous loyalty, which burns betrayers and staggers deceivers. Their radiance increases the light level within the area of the aura by one step and counts as magical light equivalent to a continual light spell for the purposes of dispelling magical darkness. Chaotic- or evil-aligned creatures that make a successful melee attack against a hiracapath take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Chaotic evil creatures suffer 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from striking the hiracapath while within the aura.
  - name: Nonlethal Mastery (Ex)
    desc: A hiracapath can deal nonlethal damage with any of its natural attacks without taking a penalty on the attack roll. When making nonlethal attacks, the hiracapath increases the critical threat range on all natural attacks to 19-20.

# Description
Hiracapaths are inhabitants of Heaven-outsiders formed from the celestial plane-but they are not true angels or archons. They exist below the lowest tiers of Heaven’s hierarchy and are commanders of celestial animals, holding no official place among Heaven’s formal ranks or society. They dwell primarily at the base of the mountain that makes up the plane, wandering the idyllic realm alone or in great, golden herds. Despite their placid appearances, hiracapaths act as Heaven’s watchdogs, running down any discovered interlopers and dragging them before more formal authorities for judgment. To hiracapaths, this arrangement is not lopsided; rather, it’s preferable, as it allows them to indulge in their natural affinity for tracking intruders while remaining outside of the official celestial hierarchy, which they find too complex and unappealing, when they even consider the matter at all.

In its natural form, a hiracapath is as an intangible cloud of soulstuff and celestial energy. Heaven itself provides each glorious creature with silver and steel armor to give it both form and purpose. Clad in gleaming plates, a hiracapath stands 9 feet tall and weighs almost 1,500 pounds.
