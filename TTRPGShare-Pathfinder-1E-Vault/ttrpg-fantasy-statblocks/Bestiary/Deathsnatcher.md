# Description
Deathsnatchers dwell amid the ruins of fallen civilizations, where they play at being godlings worshiped by undead slaves. Though self-aggrandizing, deathsnatchers are known to give homage to (and claim descent from) the various demon lords of darkness, the desert, and undeath. 

A deathsnatcher is 6 feet tall and weighs 280 pounds.
