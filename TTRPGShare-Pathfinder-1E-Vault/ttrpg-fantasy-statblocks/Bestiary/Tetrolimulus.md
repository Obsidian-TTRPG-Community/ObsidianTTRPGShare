# Description
A terrifying mix of prehistoric arthropod and heavily armored mantis, the tetrolimulus is the stuff of nightmares for shipwrecked and abandoned mariners. Plated with a spiny crustacean exoskeleton, the upper body of the tetrolimulus is reminiscent of a very robust kind of mantis. Its raptorial forelimbs, folded as if in prayer, flash forward with frightening speed and precision to brutally slice opponents before they have had a chance to act. Captains and mutineers alike are quick to remind their enemies of these deadly claws and the creature’s other name, the “beach guillotine,” for the brutal justice it exacts on those put ashore for choosing the wrong side in a mutiny.

With somewhat less panache, the tetrolimulus is often described as the “sea-mantis” because it resembles a crab’s strong legs and shell merged with a mantis’ powerful arms. Trailing behind is a scorpion’s deadly stinger. The creature’s durable, spiked shell covers five pairs of blade-like legs that work together to produce remarkable speeds even through challenging terrain. Truly a master of the beaches, the tetrolimulus has caught many mariners off guard with a blazing charge over varied terrain, perforating a noiseless trail through wet sand, then clattering over rocks with the sound of dice thrown across a table.

Its final and most dangerous terror, held upright and waved like a regal scepter in combat, is the tetrolimulus’s tail stinger. The stinger is razor sharp along its outer edge, but its neat incisions are nowhere near as dangerous as the poison that coats its blade. Those who succumb to a dose of poison-called tetrodotoxin-are soon to be a meal for the sea-mantis. Muscle spasms and cramps accompany a gradual slowing of movement, hinting at oncoming paralysis and the agony of a neat butchering while still alive for easy consumption. One of nature’s cruelest poisons, tetrodotoxin is a popular tool of the Red Mantis assassins, who appreciate both the poison’s painful efficacy and the mantis-form of its progenitor.
