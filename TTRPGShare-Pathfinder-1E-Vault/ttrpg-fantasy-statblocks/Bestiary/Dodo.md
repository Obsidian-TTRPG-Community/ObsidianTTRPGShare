# Description
These flightless birds typically inhabit isolated tropical islands and coastlines that are devoid of predators and other creatures that might kill them to use as a resource. Dodosâ€™ size and unfamiliarity with natural dangers contribute to a kind of boldness in their species-or what some would call stupidity-causing them to bumble into precarious situations and making them easy targets for other creatures that are on the prowl for a tasty meal. The birds can all too easily be caught and slain, and while their meat has a most unpleasant taste, few starving, shipwrecked sailors would turn such a providential meal down.
