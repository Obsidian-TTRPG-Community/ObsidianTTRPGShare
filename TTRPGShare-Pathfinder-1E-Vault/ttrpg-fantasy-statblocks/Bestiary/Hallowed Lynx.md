special_abilities:
  - name: Blinding Orb (Su)
    desc: A hallowed lynx has a halo of seven orbs of brilliant light. It can hurl an orb as a ranged touch attack with a range of 120 feet. A creature hit by the hallowed lynx’s blinding orb takes 10d8 points of fire damage and must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. Once hurled, an orb loses its innate brilliance and cannot be used again until 24 hours have passed, after which time its energy refreshes and it resumes glowing. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Hallowed Lights (Su)
    desc: The glowing orbs surrounding a hallowed lynx radiate light out to a distance of 60 feet. This light counters and is countered by darkness as though it were an 8th-level spell. Allies in this light, including the hallowed lynx, gain an insight bonus on Charisma-based skill checks and Will saving throws equal to the lynx’s Charisma modifier. Enemies in the light at the start of the lynx’s turn must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become blinded for 1 round. If the hallowed lynx has expended all seven of its orbs through its blinding orb or release shining child ability, the hallowed lights cease until at least one of the hallowed lynx’s orbs has refreshed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Release Shining Child (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a hallowed lynx can release the shining child encapsulated within any one of its glowing orbs. This functions as if the shining child had been summoned using a summon monster IX spell (CL 23rd). Once an orb has been used in this manner, it loses its innate brilliance and cannot be used again until 24 hours have passed, after which time its energy refreshes and it resumes glowing.

# Description
A mid-sized feline adorned with a halo of blinding orbs of light, the hallowed lynx is a creature widely thought to be mere myth or long extinct. Only a handful of hallowed lynxes exist, most held in stasis within long-buried Thassilonian ruins, though rumored sightings of the blindingly bright cats suggest that small populations may have survived to the present day. Created from keen hunters and imbued with potent light-based magic distilled from powerful outsiders, hallowed lynxes are deadly predators whose mere presence bolsters their allies. Aside from the brilliant orbs that surround them, a hallowed lynx resembles its mundane kin, having a short tail, large paws, spotted tawny fur, and distinctive tufts of fur extending from its ears. It is the same size as an ordinary lynx: just over 2 feet tall, around 3 feet long, and weighing about 35 pounds.
