# Description
Goliath spiders are giant hunting spiders that most often prey on large creatures such as giant scorpions, snakes, and younger dragons, but sometimes catch and paralyze smaller prey to eat later. Camouf laged by their hairs and coloration, they prowl atop the forest canopy, dropping upon unsuspecting creatures. Females often cannibalize their mates.
