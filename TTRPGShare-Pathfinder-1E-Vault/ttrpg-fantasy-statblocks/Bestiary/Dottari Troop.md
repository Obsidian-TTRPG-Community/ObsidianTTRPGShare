special_abilities:
  - name: Protect Ally (Ex)
    desc: A dottari troop provides soft cover to any creature it recognizes as an ally who shares its space. Such protected allies treat squares occupied by the troop as difficult terrain and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) to cast spells while so protected, but do not take troop damage from being within the troop’s space.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    desc: A dottari troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop’s space. All creatures in one of these lines take 4d6 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based, and includes the bonus from the dottari troop’s Ability Focus feat.
