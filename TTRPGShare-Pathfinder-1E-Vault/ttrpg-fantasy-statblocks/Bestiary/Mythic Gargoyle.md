special_abilities:
  - name: Freeze (Ex)
    desc: A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A gargoyle that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.
  - name: Opportunistic Movement (Ex)
    desc: A mythic gargoyle can rapidly move to take advantage of an opponent’s weakened defenses. When an opponent within 30 feet takes an action that provokes an attack of opportunity, as an immediate action the mythic gargoyle can expend one use of mythic power to move up to 40 feet, ending its movement next to the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity and making an attack of opportunity against that creature. The gargoyle’s movement from this ability doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Possess Statue (Su)
    desc: A mythic gargoyle can expend one use of mythic power to possess and animate a Medium stone statue within 100 feet. The possessed statue functions as a non-mythic gargoyle and lasts as long as the statue is in range and the gargoyle concentrates. When using this ability, the gargoyle’s actual body is immobile (as if using its freeze ability) and helpless. It can stop using this ability as a move action. If the statue is destroyed, the gargoyle’s life force returns to its own body.

# Description
A mythic gargoyle is a king or queen among its kind, usually gaining its power from an earth deity, a mythic gem embedded in its chest, or centuries of exposure to powerful magic. It has a distinct appearance, and other members of its wing slowly shift to match its look.
