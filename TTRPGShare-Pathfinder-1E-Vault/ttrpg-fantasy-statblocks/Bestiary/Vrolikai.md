special_abilities:
  - name: Black Flame Knives (Su)
    desc: A vrolikai can manifest daggers made of crystallized black flames in each of its four hands as a free action. These weapons function as +1 daggers that bestow one permanent negative level on a successful hit. A DC 27 Fortitude negates the negative level, although on a critical hit, no save is allowed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Death-Stealing Gaze (Su)
    desc: 1 permanent negative level, 30 ft., Fort DC 27 negates. Creatures slain by these negative levels become juju zombies under the vrolikai’s control. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Madness (Su)
    desc: A creature stung by a vrolikai’s tail must make a DC 27 Will save to resist taking 1d6 points of Charisma drain and becoming confused for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the victim is instead staggered for 1d4 rounds as strange visions assault its mind. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Multiweapon Mastery (Ex)
    desc: A vrolikai never takes penalties on its attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons.

# Description
A vrolikai is 14 feet tall but weighs only 500 pounds. Unlike other demons, it does not form from a sinful soul-it instead manifests from a nabasu demon that returns to the Abyss after growing to maturity on the Material Plane. Not all nabasus survive this transformation, but those who do become powerful indeed-vrolikai usually rule large regions of unclaimed Abyssal land, and often serve as assassins or ambassadors to demon lords in need of an agent in a distant realm.
