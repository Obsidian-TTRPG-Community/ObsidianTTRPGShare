tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The ratfolk sage casts mage armor on himself each morning. Because he avoids entering direct combat, if battle is imminent, the ratfolk sage casts spider climb on himself and climbs to a defensible position. If he is with several allies, he uses his wand of blur and scrolls of magic weapon on them and their weapons before he does so.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The ratfolk sage casts wall of fire to divide up the battlefield and trap the ratfolk’s enemies. He then casts offensive spells until he runs out, at which point he uses a scroll of magic weapon on his light crossbow before making attacks. If cornered, the sage uses dimension door to free himself.

# Description
Magic is most useful to the warren when it provides insight, so diviners are held in high regard. Though the ratfolk sage prepares some offensive spells in case of attack-it’s always good to be ready for danger-such things can be duplicated with alchemy and weaponry.
