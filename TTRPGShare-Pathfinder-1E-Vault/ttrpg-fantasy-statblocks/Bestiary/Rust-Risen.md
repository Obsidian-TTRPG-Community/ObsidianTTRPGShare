special_abilities:
  - name: Absorb Electricity (Ex)
    desc: When a rust-risen is damaged by electricity, it takes no damage (as if immune). Instead, the rust-risen gains 1 temporary hit point for every 4 points of damage it would have taken. A rust-risen can only have a number of temporary hit points equal to 150% of its hit point total. These temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. If a rust-risen takes more than double its normal hit point total in electricity damage from a single attack, the creature is destroyed.
  - name: Augmentations (Ex)
    desc: Rust-risen have various pieces of malfunctioning machinery embedded in their bodies. Each of these augmentations provides the rust-risen with different abilities. A rust-risen has one augmentation plus one additional augmentation for every 3 Hit Dice the creature possesses (typically 2 for most rust-risen). The rust-risen presented here has the arm drill and metal jaw augmentations. See the next page for other augmentations.
  - name: Malfunction (Ex)
    desc: The machinery embedded in a rust-risen functions unpredictably in stressful situations. When a rustrisen enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that it malfunctions. This chance resets to 0% 1 minute after combat ends. When a rust-risen malfunctions, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1d4 minutes.

# Description
Rust-risen lurk in the burned-out husks of ancient space-faring vessels and among the grease and blood stained laboratories of mad, technologist necromancers. These hideous undead mockeries riddled with the remnants of ancient technology-rotting creatures, outfitted with twitching relics of a spacefaring race, that prey on the living by tearing their victims to shreds with gnashing drills, vivisecting scalpels, and flailing exsanguination tubes.
