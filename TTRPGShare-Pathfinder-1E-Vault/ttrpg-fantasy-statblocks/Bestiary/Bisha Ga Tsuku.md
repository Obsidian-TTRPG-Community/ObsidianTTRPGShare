special_abilities:
  - name: Hoarfrost Halo (Su)
    desc: A bisha ga tsuku projects an aura of cold that freezes the surrounding air into a dense cloud of icy mist. This functions similarly to the spell obscuring mist, but the bisha ga tsuku can see through its own hoarfrost halo, and the halo moves with the bisha ga tsuku in a 30-foot radius. Creatures in the aura take 2d6 points of cold damage at the start of their turn due to the intense cold. This aura can be dispelled, but the bisha ga tsuku can resume or dismiss its hoarfrost halo as a free action.
  - name: Soul-Thieving Chill (Su)
    desc: Any creature that takes cold damage from a bisha ga tsuku’s tentacle attack or hoarfrost halo must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. On a successful critical hit, a bisha ga tsuku deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage, and the target takes 1d4 points of Charisma drain instead of Charisma damage on a failed save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Bisha ga tsukus are formed from souls drained of warmth, life, and love, leaving nothing but an empty void that can be filled only by taking from others. The creature is a horrific amalgamation of flesh comprising long feelers and a huge, distended sac. Its victims never see these features, however, since a bisha ga tsuku’s presence sucks the warmth from the atmosphere around it, freezing the air into a dense cloud of icy mist. On an already foggy evening, the only sign of a bisha ga tsuku’s presence is its three-toed feet making a squishing sound reminiscent of "bisha bisha" on the loose slush left behind by its hoarfrost halo.

Bisha ga tsukus feed upon souls. Though their presence can disperse soul energy around them, they gain far more nourishment when they inhale a soul through the pores in their feelers. A bisha ga tsuku that gorges itself stores excess souls and dying heartbeats in its sac, mixing them with frost and chill until a new bisha ga tsuku forms within and bursts out.
