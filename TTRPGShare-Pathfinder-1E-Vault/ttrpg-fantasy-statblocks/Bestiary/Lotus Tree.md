special_abilities:
  - name: Hallucination (Su)
    desc: A living creature that starts her turn within 60 feet of a lotus tree or eats its fruit hallucinates pleasantly as per synesthesia (DC 30 Will negates) for 4d6 hours. The hallucinations include a humanoid figure of shifting colors that conveys the tree’s telepathy and thoughtsense across any range, allowing the hallucinating creature to act as the tree’s proxy. Suppressing or resuming the aura is a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Hope Theft (Sp)
    desc: As a swift action at unlimited range, a lotus tree can permanently charm a hallucinating creature (as per mass charm monster but with no save bonus for hostility) unless it succeeds at a DC 29 Will save. Affected victims forget all longterm goals, desiring only more hallucinations, and grant the tree temporary PE equal to half their Hit Dice and 5 times that amount in temporary hit points for 1 day. Regardless of the save, the target automatically is affected as per mindwipe.

# Description
Lotus trees grow in ancient forests and paradisiacal islands, feeding on the fantasies of sentient beings. Some lotus trees are curious and wise; others hoard secrets while claiming they provide refuge from reality. Intentionally or not, lotus trees attract those seeking wisdom or dreamy escape.
