# Description
In humanoid form, natural weremantises are often tall and long-limbed. Many have pointy chins and brilliant green eyes that seem slightly too large for their faces. They tend to be solitary individuals, explaining their distant attitudes as a form of spirituality or piety. However, when they do make friends or take lovers, the relationships burn brightly for a short time. Eventually, though, the weremantises grow bored with the associations and end them in an equally dramatic manner, often through violent murders.
