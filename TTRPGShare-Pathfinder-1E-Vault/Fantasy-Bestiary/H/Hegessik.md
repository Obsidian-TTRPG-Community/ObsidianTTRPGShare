special_abilities:
  - name: Leaching Gaze (Su)
    desc: When opened, a hegessik’s third eye produces a powerful gaze attack with a 30-foot range. A creature affected by this attack takes 1d3 points of Wisdom damage unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Will save. Proteans are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Maddening Whispers (Su)
    desc: A mind-bending susurrus of voices and false perceptions infuses reality in close proximity to a hegessik protean. Any creature within the range of the protean’s aura must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature with a chaotic component to its alignment gains a +4 bonus on this save, and creatures with the chaotic subtype are immune. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Telekinetic Reach (Su)
    desc: Every 1d4 rounds, a hegessik protean can take a full-round action to make all of its natural attacks as a flurry of telekinetic force with a range of 60 feet. Such attack rolls take a -5 penalty when made at a distance of up to 30 feet, and a -10 penalty when made at a distance of 31-60 feet. A hegessik protean must have line of effect to a target in order to use this ability. A hegessik can’t use its grab or warpwave ability with attacks made using this ability.

# Description
The reclusive hegessiks are the wandering clergy of the protean race, itinerant spiritual elders and voices in the supernatural wilderness. Detached from the ever-shifting pseudo-structure of powerful protean cabals, hegessiks serve as intermediaries between them and as agents of the protean lords. Along with keketar proteans (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 215), they deal with those gods who dwell within the Maelstrom. 

The average hegessik is 14 feet long and weighs 1,400 pounds.
