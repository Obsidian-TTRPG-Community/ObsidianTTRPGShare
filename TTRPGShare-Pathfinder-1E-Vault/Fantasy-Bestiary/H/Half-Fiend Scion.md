# Description
Urdefhans never forget who created them, and they spend their lives awaiting the day they will be destroyed and returned to Abaddon for an eternity of torment. Their frequent interactions with daemons occasionally spawns reality-warping half-blood children who rise to positions of great power in urdefhan society-if they manage to survive.
