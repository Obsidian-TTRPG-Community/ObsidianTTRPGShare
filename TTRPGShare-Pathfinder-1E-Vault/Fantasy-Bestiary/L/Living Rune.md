special_abilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    desc: A living rune is able to shift its coloration and form to blend into its surroundings. The creature automatically hits with its touch attack against any creature that fails to notice it and enters its square.
  - name: Glyph Touch (Su)
    desc: A living rune deals 3d8 points of electricity damage with a successful touch attack, and it uses its Dexterity modifier (instead of its Strength modifier) to resolve all touch attacks.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    desc: A living rune is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain other spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below. An erase spell deals 6d6 points of damage to a living rune.A living rune caught in the radius of any symbol spell is immune to its effects and heals 1d8 points of damage per spell level. Hit points beyond its total maximum are gained as temporary hit points that fade in 1 hour.A living rune is affected normally by magic missile, maze, and spells that deal sonic damage.
  - name: Symbols of Power (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a living rune can shift its form into a number of powerful symbols whose effects can damage or incapacitate opponents. Each round the living rune can choose a new effect, but a particular symbol form can only be used once every 4 rounds. This attack is resolved with a touch attack and the save DC is Charisma-based.

Fear: The target becomes panicked for 2d6 rounds (Will DC 24).

Pain: The target suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 hour (Fort DC 24).

Persuasion: The target is charmed by the living rune (as charm monster) for 2d6 hours (Will DC 24).

Slow: The target is slowed (as the slow spell) for 12 rounds (Will DC 24).

Stunning: The target is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Fort DC 24).

Weakness: The target suffers crippling weakness that deals 2d6 points of Strength damage (Fort DC 24).
  - name: Truescript (Su)
    desc: A living rune can sculpt its form into complicated scripts and pictographs that can be understood by any creature with the ability to read written language. A living rune can also understand any written or spoken language.
  - name: Two-Dimensional (Ex)
    desc: A living rune only exists in two dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living rune has no Strength score. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can only navigate along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can only attack creatures by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living rune can crawl onto solid surfaces that can then themselves be moved (such as onto a tome via its telekinesis spell-like ability). It cannot fall or take falling damage, cannot make trip or grapple attacks, and cannot be tripped or grappled. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent’s equipment, has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight. A living rune takes no damage from nonmagical attacks and only takes half damage from magical weapons.

# Description
Whether first scribed by some forgotten deity or birthed by magic glyphs long soured, living runes are among the most stubborn and arrogant of dungeon denizens. Though two-dimensional and lacking any sort of real body, the creatures are sentient, but with a venomous hostility toward the so-called “lesser races” they feel are corrupted forms of the universe’s first words of creation. Appearing as magical glyphs, animated pulsating runes, etched hieroglyphics, or even ancient cave art, these creatures live to prey on lesser beings for no other reason than to prove their superiority over flesh-and-blood creatures.
