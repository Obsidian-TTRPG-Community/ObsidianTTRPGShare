# Description
Souls of chaotic evil mortals are drawn to the Abyss upon death and reform as the revolting larvae: pale, worm-bodied creatures with insectile heads somewhat resembling those they had in life, but with bestial features. For most of these despised petitioners, their sense of identity have been obliterated, and all that remains are their execrable natures, animal instincts, and hostility for the living. Like a pernicious infestation, larvae are found in every realm of the Abyss. Those larvae not consumed by other feral life eventually undergo a metamorphosis, transforming into one of the endless varieties of demons, a form that often mirrors the petitioner’s sins and vices in life.

 The economy of the Abyss varies from realm to realm, but in every corner larvae are valued commodities: as food, as components for ceremonies and sorcery, and as playthings for the despicable population. So coveted are these foul creatures that some enterprising denizens create vile farms where larvae are corralled like cattle, fed on the various filth in the Abyss, and “nurtured” until they have achieved particular states of “ripeness” that appeal to the various depraved tastes of various fiends, evil magic-users, and worse. Other larvae are raised through grueling processes into exacting forms of designed demonic life, tended with the careful ministrations of Abyssal artisans. These malign sculptors blend the cultivation of specific degraded and evil qualities with bizarre surgical magic to produce demons that suit the needs and desires of their specialized clientele.
