    desc: A hollow serpent notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Negatively Charged Coils (Su)
    desc: A hollow serpent deals an additional 2d6 points of damage caused by negative energy to victims trapped within its coils. A successful DC 16 Will save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Among the many manifestations of serpentfolk faith, the hollow serpent represents one of the most horrific harbingers of doom. Serpentfolk legend suggests Ydersius created the first hollow serpents as protectors and guardians for their underground enclaves. But serpentfolk priests soon learned how to make more, worshiping and cultivating the skin sheddings of monstrously giant snakes with rituals to turn them into engines of destruction. Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk, proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years of the serpentfolkâ€™s age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually, however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the serpentfolk elite.

A typical hollow serpent measures a little over 15 feet long and weighs 500 pounds. A lesser hollow serpent is 7 feet long and weighs just 90 pounds.
