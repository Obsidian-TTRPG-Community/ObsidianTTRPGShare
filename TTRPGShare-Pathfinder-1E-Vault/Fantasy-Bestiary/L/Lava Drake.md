special_abilities:
  - name: Magma Shake (Ex)
    desc: Whenever a lava drake exits from being submerged in molten rock (either magma or lava), on the next round as a full-round action, it can shake its body, flicking a fine spray of scalding molten rock in every direction. All creatures within a 30-foot radius of the lava drake take 5d6 points of fire damage from the shower of scalding rock; a successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. Performing a magma shake clears the drake’s scales of all excess molten rock and it must resubmerge itself in order to use this attack again. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Pyroclastic Vomit (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a lava drake can vomit forth a ball of molten rock that explodes upon striking a target, showering the target and adjacent creatures in magma. This attack has a range of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 19 half) to the primary target and 3d6 points of fire damage to any creatures within 20 feet of the primary target. The magma continues to burn for 1d3 rounds, dealing an additional 3d6 points of fire damage per round to the primary target and 1d6 points of fire damage per round to any secondary targets. After the magma cools, it crumbles to dust. Once a lava drake has used its pyroclastic vomit, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    desc: Three times per day as a swift action, a lava drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an addition move action that round.

# Description
The deviant and destructive cousins of primal magma dragons, lava drakes rise from smoldering volcanic crevasses to terrorize and devour those creatures weaker than themselves. While far less intelligent that their draconic kin, they are equally arrogant and seek out the adoration of humanoids. They can and often do submerge themselves in molten rock, burrowing through the lava to sneak up on prey, or to provide a dramatic display of power to those who worship them. Thick, blackcrusted scales cover a lava drake’s body.

Stockier than other drakes, adults can grow up to 18 feet in length and weigh over 3,000 pounds.
