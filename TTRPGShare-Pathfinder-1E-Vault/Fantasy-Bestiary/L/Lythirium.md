special_abilities:
  - name: Rampant Growth (Ex)
    desc: A lythirium’s antlers teem with constantly growing thorny vines that can entangle creatures and make them bleed. When a lythirium hits a creature with its gore attack, that creature is entangled for 1d4 rounds and takes 1d6 points of bleed damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex saving throw negates the entangled condition and reduces the bleed damage to 1d3 points. The save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Thorny Body (Ex)
    desc: A creature that strikes a lythirium with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike takes 2d8 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the lythirium’s rampant growth. A creature that successfully grapples a lythirium takes 2d8 points of damage and is exposed to its rampant growth at the start of the grapple each round it maintains the grapple.
  - name: Verdant Glide (Ex)
    desc: A lythirium can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. It ignores any magically manipulated overgrowth with thorns, briars, or other natural growth that would normally impede its motion.

# Description
Savage hunters of those who would harm their habitats, lythiriums prowl Golarion’s densest forests, seeking to protect the wild, untouched natural growth they hold sacred. While they have lived on the Material Plane for millennia, lythiriums are actually descended from primordial beasts native to the First World-creatures that fused plant and animal so seamlessly they seemed both and neither simultaneously. Peering out of seedpod eyes that radiate a soft green glow, lythiriums have exceptionally keen senses; they are not shy about preserving their forests, and they deliver their warnings in rasping voices reminiscent of leaves blowing across the earth.

 At its haunches, a lythirium measures 6 feet in height, with thorns, vines, and flowering blossoms inching ever higher. Its massive body is a matrix of vines, roots, and fine, furry moss and lichens. Immense branches shape its powerful chest and limbs. From thorny head to tail, a lythirium measures 9 feet in length; it can weigh as much as 900 pounds.
