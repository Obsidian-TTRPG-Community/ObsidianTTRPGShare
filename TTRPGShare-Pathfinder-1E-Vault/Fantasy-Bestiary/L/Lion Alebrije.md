# Description
Alebrijes travel through dreams, visiting creatures as they sleep in hopes of answering questions, jogging memories, or providing inspiration. Alebrijes can take the shape of any animal or magical beast found throughout the Material Plane, though they have unique colorations and patterns all over their bodies, and some grow wings. These colorations typically include bright, vibrant hues and decorative patterns like spirals and stripes.
