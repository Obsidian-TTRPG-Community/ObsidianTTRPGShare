    desc: Some of a lampadarius’s body is composed of incorporeal shadow. As a result, it has a 25% chance of taking no damage from any nonmagical attack. It takes only 75% of the damage from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. However, it takes full damage from incorporeal creatures and effects, force effects, and ghost touch weapons.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    desc: A lampadarius’s touch deals 1d6 points of Strength damage to a living creature. This is a negative energy effect. If the kyton deals Strength damage that equals or exceeds the target’s Strength score, the kyton gains the benefits of death knell for 1 hour.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Su)
    desc: Shaken, range 30 ft., Will DC 13 negates. A lampadarius can make an opponent feel like its own shadow is attempting to claw its face. Those who fail their saves are shaken for 1d3 rounds. This ability has no effect if there is no light present to create shadows. In dim illumination, the DC increases by 2. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
A kyton lampadarius is a servitor of the Midnight Lord who, instead of continually replacing parts of its body with those of other creatures, embraced the will of Zon-Kuthon by cutting away its flesh and replacing the lost parts with burning darkness from the Shadow Plane. Walking a fine line between outsider and undead, a lampadarius balances the freezing pain of its new body parts with the burning pleasures of its remaining flesh, continually indulging both as it gains power. It yearns to attain a perfect body of true shadows, yet pines for it missing flesh and the potential for sensation lost.

A lampadarius resembles a common evangelist kyton (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 185) with many old and new wounds, but instead of it being wrapped in chains, entire limbs and half of its face are nothing more than shifting shadow. Individuals have vastly varied appearances-some have a shadowy right arm, others a shadowy left, some replace both limbs on the same side, others alternate which limbs are replaced-but all have some portion of the face removed. All are very close to being half-shadow, as a lesser amount is insufficient to grant them power, and too much converts them to some other kind of shadow-creature.

Lampadariuses stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh about 80 pounds.
