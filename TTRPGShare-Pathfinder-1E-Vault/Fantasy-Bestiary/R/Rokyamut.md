special_abilities:
  - name: Expeditious Calculation (Su)
    desc: Three times per day, as a swift action a rokyamut can attempt to use any of its spell-like abilities with the lawful descriptor. To do so, it must succeed at a Knowledge (engineering) check with a DC equal to 20 plus twice the spell’s level. On a failure, the casting is lost and the rokyamut is dazed for 1 round.
  - name: Prudent Positioning (Ex)
    desc: Three times per day as an immediate action, a rokyamut can position itself precisely to avoid danger. This allows the rokyamut to either treat the result of a Reflex save as though it had rolled a natural 20 or automatically avoid a single attack of opportunity it provokes.
  - name: Symbological Attack (Su)
    desc: A rokyamut can conjure a two-dimensional mathematical symbol of rigid perfection into one or more of its hands as a free action. When attacking with these symbols, the rokyamut slices through unliving matter. These symbols act as +2 brilliant energy starknives, except they can harm undead and constructs (but not objects). While fighting with its symbols, a rokyamut gains Two-Weapon Fighting as a bonus feat. A symbol disappears 1 round after it leaves a rokyamut’s grasp.
  - name: Unrelenting Geometry (Su)
    desc: A rokyamut’s presence creates a stabilizing effect that impairs folds in space. Teleportation spells and spell-like abilities automatically fail if they begin or end within 300 feet of a rokyamut, even if the effect is created by the rokyamut itself. Creatures within this aura can’t benefit from any miss chance due to shuffling between states of reality, such as that provided by blink.

# Description
Rokyamuts are rigid defenders of mathematical laws and geometric truths, seeking out those who would bend space or subvert the rules of reality. Their targets are primarily aberrant aliens, plane-twisting outsiders, and cosmic calamities, but they oppose any creatures that view the immutable laws of physics as suggestions rather than rules. Rokyamuts are juggernauts of stability found in the warped places of the multiverse.

 Rokyamuts have a thick, armored chassis that resembles an elephant from the waist down. Four powerful arms protrude from their barrel-chested torsos, two on each side. Their heads are capped with bare steel. Complex and delicate clockworks are visible in openings at their joints. A halo of glowing symbols floats around a rokyamut’s head, expressing mathematical functions in a dizzying array of languages and computational systems. Rokyamuts can conjure similar symbols into their hands to use as weapons, fighting with calculated precision. Although these blades are effective against nearly any foe, rokyamuts can sense the presence of lawful creatures instinctively and rarely target them unless provoked.

 Like other inevitables, rokyamuts aren’t born and are instead crafted by the axiomites of Axis as directed by the Godmind or the primal inevitables. Rokyamuts are commissioned in response to aberrant misuse of mathematics or geometry-altering cosmic phenomena.

 Rokyamuts often work alone, although they coordinate with others of their kind efficiently to combat serious threats. Over long years of pursuing multiple missions, rokyamuts generally fall into one of two categories: planar custodians or cosmic stabilizers.

 Rokyamuts working as planar custodians have long experience on planes with unusual geometry or loose physical laws, such as the Maelstrom or the First World. They work to bring consistency to these realms by finding and destroying sources of reality-warping magic. These rokyamuts are often more diplomatic in nature, and they have a critical eye for weighing risk and reward. Lhaksharuts often aid these rokyamuts in their efforts, as lhaksharuts’ work in closing down unstable planar breaches is made easier when the laws of reality are, even temporarily, forced into well-behaved stability.

 Rokyamuts working as cosmic stabilizers often operate alone to explore the depths of space on the Material Plane in order to confront dangerous aliens or rogue cosmic phenomena. These rokyamuts make plans on truly enormous scales, such as crashing a planetoid into a pending solar flare to prevent a severe gravitational event. They are often knowledgeable about the Great Old Ones and the Dominion of the Black, as their missions take them into conflict with these entities on a regular basis. Cosmic stabilizers are often surly and untrusting, and see their missions in stark black-and-white terms. Few creatures consider these rokyamuts pleasant company, and fewer still intentionally draw their single-minded ire.

 A rokyamut is 65 feet tall and weighs 200 tons.
