special_abilities:
  - name: Bloody Bones Mastery (Su)
    desc: A rawhead can sense the direction and condition of all bloody bones within a 1-mile radius. This functions as if via a status spell (even though undead normally cannot be affected by this spell).
  - name: Charisma Damage (Su)
    desc: A rawhead’s tentacle fingers strip away flesh and emotion alike, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage on every hit with its claw attack (Will DC 23 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Bloody Bones (Su)
    desc: A rawhead can create a bloody bones from a Small or Medium helpless, living humanoid. As a full round action, the rawhead extends its finger tentacle to pierce the creature’s flesh, ensnares its bones, and attempts to rip the creature’s skeleton free. This deals 10d6 points of damage to the victim. If the victim is helpless as a result of Charisma damage, it takes 10d8 points of damage from this attack instead. If this damage is enough to reduce the creature’s hit points below 0, it is instantly slain as its skeleton is extracted from its body. The skeleton immediately animates as a bloody bones (see page 49) under the rawhead’s control. This is a death effect.
  - name: Hidden Terror (Ex)
    desc: A rawhead can activate its frightful presence ability as a swift action, and can affect creatures that are unaware of its presence or aren’t within line of sight.

# Description
Some believe rawheads to be nothing more than figments from scary stories, typically associated with the childhood terror known as bloody bones (see page 49). But others know rawheads to be all too real and live in fear of attracting their attention. 

A rawhead stands almost 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
