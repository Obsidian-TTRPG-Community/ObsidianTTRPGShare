# Description
The rhinoceros feeds on leafy plants, branches, and even thorny shrubs. Its thick hide is a mottled gray color, and it can run surprisingly fast for a beast of its size. The rhinoceros is notoriously short-tempered and prone to attacking anything it perceives as approaching too closely (generally within a distance of 80 feet-the distance of a single charge-for most rhinos).
