desc_short: This hunched-over, vaguely humanoid creature has gauntly muscled biceps beneath a sandy hide and coarse fur. Its head is that of a jagged-toothed antelope, the face spotted with rot and sand slowly sifting out from between the fibers of its hair, and its legs end at the shin in stumps of charred flesh.

# Description
Over 3,000 years ago in the southern parts of the vast Thuvian desert, the great alchemist Artokus Kirran was able to harness the power of the rare and beautiful sun orchard and create an elixir that temporarily halted the process of aging in whoever consumed it. While this monumental discovery ultimately united the city-states of the vast desert nation, its creation also inspired many people of baser intentions to entertain their own selfish thoughts of eternal life, spurring them to do whatever they must in order to obtain some of the legendary sun orchid elixir.

It was under this banner of greed that the infamous rogue Jalari Zafikiri assembled a team of fellow bandits. Their mission was to infiltrate the famed Citadel of the Alchemist, and Jalari promised the members of his crew that they would be able to coerce the alchemist to provide them all with enough sun orchard elixir to last until the end of days. But when the bandits passed too closely to the House of Oblivion on their way from Merab to the Citadel, however, they were besieged by divs, and most of their food stocks were destroyed in the ensuing battle. Desperate to complete his quest, Jalari continued on with his remaining allies, but the desert was too vast. The once-powerful rogue began to go mad in the desert heat, and in the dead of night he slaughtered his fellow thieves for food. His own shame completed his insanity, and when Jalari ran at a dead sprint across the dunes, he took flight and died in midair, the spirit of a wendigo taking over the husk of his withered body in his stead.

Now, certain isolated Thuvian tribes raise goat-headed totems to the beast that stalks the nearby sandstone cliffs and massive dunes. Its forlorn howl echoes on the evening winds, and villagers disappear only to turn up later as withered, half-eaten husks when they fail to maintain their monthly sacrifices on lonely, windswept altars.
