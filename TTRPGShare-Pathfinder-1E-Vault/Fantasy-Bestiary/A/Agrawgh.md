    desc: An agrawgh can burrow through solid stone at half its normal burrow rate. When traveling using its burrow speed, as a free action an agrawgh can choose whether to leave a tunnel in its wake that is 10 feet tall by 10 feet wide. As long as the agrawgh does not encounter any non-dirt or non-stone substances along its way, it digests dirt and stone with its stomach acids at a rate equal to its burrow movement speed. An agrawgh can’t run or perform combat maneuvers while burrowing. If an agrawgh encounters any creature while burrowing (such as one using meld with stone), it can’t enter that square.

# Description
Burrowing creatures whose bodies sport a number of bronze rings that allow them to carve perfectly uniform tunnels, these natives of the Plane of Earth use their impressive distended mouths to chew through dirt and stone, digesting the inorganic material with their powerful stomach acid. Agrawghs are typically 15 to 20 feet in length and weigh almost 2,500 pounds each.

 According to legend, the Crystalline Queen- Sairazul, the benevolent but now-trapped elemental lord-created the first agrawghs to dig tunnels that would attract extraplanar races to the Plane of Earth. Many of the plane’s existing caverns are the result of agrawghs’ wanderings, and some even speculate that the immense tunnel known as the Vent are the result of numerous agrawghs working in concert.

 Agrawghs can speak Terran, as well as many common tongues. Unlike xorns, agrawghs care little for material wealth, but they are known for offering their services as diggers in exchange for the ability to travel to previously unvisited locales. Throughout history, a few spellcasters have called agrawghs to the Material Plane to assist in massive excavations. An agrawgh can be summoned as an alternative option for the summon monster V spell.
