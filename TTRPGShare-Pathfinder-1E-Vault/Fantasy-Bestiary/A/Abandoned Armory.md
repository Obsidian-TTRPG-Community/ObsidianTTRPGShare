special_abilities:
  - name: Leaden Weariness (Su)
    desc: Any creature that strikes an abandoned armory with a melee weapon or natural attack must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected by slow for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not it succeeds at the saving throw, a creature cannot be affected again by this ability for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Perimeter Defense (Su)
    desc: Once per minute as a standard action, an abandoned armory can fire a barrage of energy in a 60-foot cone. The barrage deals 14d6 points of damage, half of which is fire damage and half of which is electricity damage. A successful DC 20 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    desc: An abandoned armory applies 1-1/2 its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20 with its slam attacks.
  - name: Reflect Spell (Su)
    desc: Once per day as an immediate action, an abandoned armory can turn back a spell targeting it as spell turning. An abandoned armory can turn up to seven spell levels with this ability. If an abandoned armory attempts to reflect an ineligible spell, this ability fails and is wasted.
  - name: Tide of Metal (Su)
    desc: An abandoned armory can switch between its ebb-tide and rip-tide battle modes as a swift action. An abandoned armory begins combat in ebb-tide mode (reflected in the above statistics). In rip-tide mode, an abandoned armory undergoes several changes, as noted below. The abandoned armory’s AC decreases from 29 to 24. The abandoned armory’s speed increases from 20 to 50 feet. The abandoned armory applies twice its Strength modifier to its slam attacks and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. The abandoned armory’s reach increases from 15 to 25 feet. The abandoned armory gains the trip ability with its slam attacks. The abandoned armory loses its leaden weariness, perimeter defense, and reflect spells abilities.

# Description
An abandoned armory is an animated mass of weapons and armor, both magic and mundane, as well as spell-imbued items of offensive utility. Moving with uncanny locomotion, these constructs scour battlefields seeking objects of war that once held special significance to previous owners who were slain in combat. Due to the faint psychic imprints of the slain combatants from which they collect these artifacts, abandoned armories make it their mission to reunite the items with their past owners or find new owners worthy of wielding their finds. This process proves to be fatal, however, as the constant psychic echoes cause an abandoned armory to believe everyone is unworthy and slay them in hopes of finding a new suitable owner for that individual’s equipment. This behavior has led abandoned armories to become something to be feared on the battlefield as they tear through an area, slaying every combatant they encounter.

 An abandoned armory is roughly 15 feet wide, cresting up to 20 feet tall, and weighs about 15 tons.
