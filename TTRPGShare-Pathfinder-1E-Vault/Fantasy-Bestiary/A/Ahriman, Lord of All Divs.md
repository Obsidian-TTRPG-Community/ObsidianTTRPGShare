special_qualities: Ahriman’s scourge, Lord of All Divs, slaughtered slave
special_abilities:
  - name: Ahriman’s Scourge (Su)
    desc: Ahriman’s Huge scourge is made from the spines of genies. It deals 3d6 points of damage, and gains the bane weapon special ability when used it to attack a genie. The scourge only functions for Ahriman. If his scourge is lost or destroyed, Ahriman can magically create a new one from the skeletons of four genies.
  - name: Aura of Hopelessness (Su)
    desc: Any creature that comes within 30 feet of Ahriman must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Bottomless Maw (Su)
    desc: When Ahriman bites a creature and successfully grabs it, he magically banishes the creature to an extraplanar bottomless pit. Ahriman can’t swallow a creature that has the good subtype or is affected by holy aura.

A swallowed creature takes 2d8+12 points of sonic damage each round as it plummets endlessly through Ahriman’s cacophonous interior-a repulsive, lightless pit where heresies and praises to Ahriman are screamed in all languages at once. The creature must also succeed at a DC 39 Will save each round or be dominated, as dominate monster, for 1 day. Ahriman knows when a creature becomes dominated, and can expel any creature as a move action, causing it to appear in any adjacent square. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A swallowed creature can’t cut its way out. Any creature in the area of silence or a similar affect is unaffected by the sonic damage and domination. A swallowed creature can escape by using plane shift or similar magic. The Lord of All Divs is stunned for 1 round and forced to expel all creatures in his stomach if a creature in his stomach casts holy aura or summons a creature with the good subtype, or if a creature either inside or out of his stomach casts atonement, freedom, holy word, limited wish, miracle, or wish.
  - name: Consume Essence (Su)
    desc: Ahriman’s soul-rending savagery erodes the fundamental essence of his victims. When he confirms a critical hit with a natural weapon, the target takes 1d6 points of ability drain to a random ability score (Fortitude DC 39 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Crown of Fourfold Curses (Su)
    desc: The ancient curses graven on the horns crowning Ahriman’s head grant him a +14 profane bonus to AC and a +4 profane bonus to spell resistance against spells or spell-like abilities with the good descriptor or those cast by good creatures. If Ahriman confirms a critical hit with his gore attack, the target is stricken with bestow curse (DC 36). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Freeing Chains (Su)
    desc: Multiple chains wrap around Ahriman’s body, and three select links can free him if he’s bound. Ahriman can break one of these links to gain the benefits of freedom. He can do this as an immediate action to negate an applicable effect being cast on him.
  - name: Lord of All Divs
    desc: Ahriman gains a suite of traits as Lord of the Divs. Regeneration (Ex) Only epic and good damage, good damage from a mythic source, or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as an archdevil, deity, or demon lord) interrupts Ahriman’s regeneration.Immunity to ability damage and drain, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, energy drain, and petrification.Resistance to acid 30 and electricity 30.Resurrection (Ex) Ahriman’s power is rooted in his domain in Abaddon. If he is slain, his body collapses into a mass of writhing snakes and is restored to life (as true resurrection) at the foot of his mountain. Once this occurs, Ahriman can’t use this ability until a full year has passed; if slain again before that time, he is forever destroyed.Frightful Presence (Su) Ahriman can activate his frightful presence as a free action as part of any attack, spell-like ability, special attack, or by speaking aloud.Summon Divs (Sp) Three times per day as a swift action, Ahriman can summon any div or combination of divs whose total combined CR is 20 or lower, or summon a unique div of his choice. This otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule, with a 100% chance of success, and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.Telepathy 300 feet.Ahriman’s natural weapons and any weapons he wields are treated as epic and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Ahriman can grant spells to his worshipers as if he were a deity. His domains are Darkness, Death, Destruction, and Evil. His favored weapon is the whip.
  - name: Shake Faith (Su)
    desc: When Ahriman strikes a divine spellcaster with a melee attack, the target is shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 38 reduces the duration to 1 round). On a critical hit, the target is frightened instead of shaken for the same duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Skin of Serpents (Su)
    desc: Ahriman’s flesh writhes with countless vipers, embodiments of ancient and forgotten evils. Any creature striking Ahriman in melee (unless using a reach weapon) must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. The save DC is Charismabased. If the creature fails its save, Ahriman gains 5 temporary hit points.
  - name: Slaughtered Slave (Su)
    desc: Any humanoid slain by Ahriman becomes a cairn wight (or brute wight if it was a giant) in 1d4 rounds. A genie killed by Ahriman instead rises as a ghul in 1d4 rounds. The creature is enslaved to Ahriman’s will and loses all abilities and memories it had in life.
  - name: Symbolic Prison (Su)
    desc: When Ahriman entraps a creature in his bottomless maw or in a maze spell, he can use one of his symbol spell-like abilities as a swift action. The symbol affects all creatures within the prison, and ends when all creatures have escaped the maw or maze.

# Description
Ahriman sprang from the darkest shadows of the elements at the birth of the genie races. Though he towers nearly 20 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds, Ahriman moves with uncanny swiftness. Ahriman’s rampages leave legions of undead in his wake that, alongside nihilistic Usij cultists, tear down life, culture, and civilization. To the Lord of All Divs, suffering and pain are meat and drink, corruption and murder useful tools, and the end of all things the only worthwhile goal.
