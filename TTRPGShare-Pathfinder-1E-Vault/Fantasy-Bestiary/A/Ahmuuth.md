# Description
An ahmuuth is a servitor of Pharasma who is responsible for helping mortals destroy undead and dispatch renegade souls evading the goddess’s judgment. Unlike morrigna psychopomps (Bestiary 4 219), who hunt lost or corrupted souls on their own, ahmuuths work with mortal worshipers of Pharasma and try to usher creatures like ghosts to peaceable final ends-when they can. When they can’t, they have no qualms about forcing wayward spirts to face their goddess’s judgement. An ahmuuth looks like a humanoid wearing an owl mask, and is always accompanied by floating gravestone shards that act as a shield. Like owls, ahmuuths are silent stalkers, revealing themselves only at the moment of attack. Ahmuuths stand just over 6 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.
