    desc: An anhana carries a pair of gardening shears about 10 inches long. In the hands of an anhana, these shears deal damage as per a +1 short sword two sizes larger than the anhana. An anhana can use its Weapon Finesse feat with its shears. If an anhanaâ€™s shears are lost or destroyed, it can make another pair with a week of work and a few scraps of metal.

    desc: Once per day, four anhanas who are working together can speak with any body of standing or flowing fresh water at least as large as an anhana. This ability functions like stone tell.

# Description
Peaceful and kindly woodland creatures, anhanas tend to forest trees and befriend animals and foresters. Although an anhana has the general appearance of a young halfling woman, her unnatural eyes and erratic demeanor mark her as a fey creature. Anhanas are wise, clever, and helpful. They use their magical shears to tend to the forest, encouraging its growth and development so that nature and civilization can exist in harmony. Anhanas return kindness with generosity, but they use their otherworldly abilities to confound and delay enemies of the forest.

An anhana stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.
