    desc: An akizendri’s bite deals 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (Will DC 14 negates). A confirmed critical hit doubles the Wisdom damage and causes creatures within 20 feet of the target to become confused (Will DC 14 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Text Immersion (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, an akizendri can physically immerse itself in a book, scroll, or similar object. It gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise check to disguise itself as a book and gains full control over the actual text the object displays. It cannot make physical attacks, but it can use its spell-like abilities and cast any spells recorded in a scroll it has immersed itself within, or cast spells up to 5th level if it’s immersed in a spellbook. The akizendri can still be targeted by attacks and effects while immersed, but any damage is dealt to the object. The akizendri is forced out if the object is destroyed or affected by antimagic field, break enchantment, dispel magic, or mage’s disjunction.

# Description
Akizendris are the bane of scholars, capable of altering text, transposing sections between disparate tomes, and erasing book chapters only to vomit them up elsewhere.
