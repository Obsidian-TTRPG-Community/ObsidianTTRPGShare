special_abilities:
  - name: Biting Locusts (Ex)
    desc: An acrididaemon’s lower body is composed entirely of buzzing and biting locusts. Medium or smaller creatures can share the space of an acrididaemon. An acrididaemon automatically deals 6d6 points of damage to any creature that begins its turn in the acrididaemon’s space.
  - name: SwarmLike (Ex)
    desc: Much of an acrididaemon’s body has no discernible anatomy. Any time a creature confirms a critical hit against an acrididaemon or hits one with a sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. An acrididaemon takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects such as fireball and splash weapons.

# Description
Servitors of the Horseman of Famine, acrididaemons travel in sky-darkening swarms that spread abject terror into the hearts of mortals they encounter. Part humanoid and part swarm, acrididaemons devour everything they can.

These roaming terrors call no place home aside from the desolation of Abaddon. They wander the planes ravaging everything in their wake, and quickly abandon their ruined targets, like the parasitic paragons they were created to be.

Acrididaemons delight in the suffering their predations bring. Though they often favor tactics that result in the devastation of whole settlements, it is not uncommon for one of these daemons to take a single creature prisoner. They enjoy slowly starving captives to death in forlorn redoubts where rescue is beyond hope.
