  - name: Treasure
    desc: triple (+5 disrupting holy merciful flail, other treasure)
special_abilities:
  - name: Adoration (Ex)
    desc: The first time each round a creature attempts to attack Arshea (whether with a melee attack, a ranged attack, or a spell), that creature must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or hesitate and waste the action (losing the spell or daily use, if applicable). If Arshea attacked that creature in the last round, the creature automatically succeeds at this Will save. Evil creatures gain a +10 bonus on this Will save. This is a mind affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Endless Dance (Ex)
    desc: Arshea adds their Charisma bonus to all damage rolls with weapon attacks (this bonus is already calculated into their statistics above).
  - name: Flawless Form (Ex)
    desc: Arshea exults in the body’s full freedom of motion and the beauty of the physical form. Whenever wearing revealing clothing (or no clothing) and no armor, Arshea adds their Wisdom bonus as an insight bonus to their Armor Class and their Charisma bonus as a sacred bonus to their Armor Class (these bonuses are already calculated into their statistics above).
  - name: Freedom’s Call (Ex)
    desc: Arshea is immune to any effects that abrogate freedom, as if constantly under the effects of freedom.
  - name: Fulfillment (Su)
    desc: Arshea instantly receives the full results of detect anxieties, detect desires, and detect thoughts on the first round of examining a creature. In addition to the creature’s current desires, Arshea’s detect desires reveals the creature’s deepest underlying desires-those that would bring it true fulfillment if granted. If the creature’s deepest desires are wicked or perverse in nature, Arshea also learns the creature’s deepest nonharmful desire, if any, and whether its fulfillment might help the creature eschew the darkness constraining its heart. Arshea can produce an effect within the bounds of wish without spending a use of the daily spell-like ability, but only to help grant a creature fulfillment as determined by this ability, and only once per creature. Participating in a creature’s fulfillment and release from needless constraints is a religious and often sexual experience for both parties involved. For 24 hours afterward, both Arshea and the fulfilled creature receive a +4 morale bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, as well as to caster level.
  - name: Nomadic (Ex)
    desc: Arshea, unlike many empyreal lords, does not keep a static empyreal realm. Instead, Arshea is nomadic, traveling the wilds of Nirvana as they see fit. As a swift action once per day, Arshea can designate a region on Nirvana to serve as their territory-this region cannot include any area currently claimed by another empyreal lord or deity as part of a planar realm. The area of the territory can vary, but it never extends more than 100 miles from the point Arshea selected as the center of their territory. The next time Arshea uses this ability to generate a planar territory, it cannot overlap any region that served them as a planar territory within the previous 24 hours. Within this planar territory, Arshea enjoys the full benefits of an empyreal realm, as detailed on page 87 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4, including the ability to use mythic spell-like abilities and the mythic power ability.
  - name: Primal Aura (Su)
    desc: Creatures within Arshea’s primal aura must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed with euphoria. On a successful save, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against emotion-based effects while remaining within Arshea’s primal aura, but it is immune to further effects from the primal aura for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature becomes dazed for 1 round from overwhelming sensations in addition to the -2 penalty on all saving throws against emotion-based effects. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unlimited Abandon (Su)
    desc: All of Arshea’s mind-affecting spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and extraordinary abilities affect all creatures, regardless of those creatures’ immunity to charms, compulsions, emotion effects, or mind-affecting effects. A mythic or deific creature with such an immunity still loses its immunity, but gains a +4 bonus on its saving throws against these effects and can roll twice and then choose the best result.

# Description
Arshea is known as the embodiment of irrepressible passion and exultation, and is also named among mortals as the Spirit of Abandon and the Host of Delectation. Their unique form combines the most attractive traits of both femininity and masculinity-seen as such not only by members of the human race, but by those of any species that have an encounter with the empyreal lord. The empyreal lord is of both genders and neither, unfettered by such distinctions. Arshea has no personal realm, instead journeying throughout the celestial realms and the mortal world unpredictably, trailing a wake of beauty, freedom, and sensuality
