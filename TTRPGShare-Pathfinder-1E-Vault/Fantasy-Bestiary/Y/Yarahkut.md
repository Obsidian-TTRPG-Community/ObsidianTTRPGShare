special_abilities:
  - name: Dismantling Gaze (Su)
    desc: Once per round as a swift action, a yarahkut can concentrate its gaze on any item within 100 feet and damage that item. Attended items must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or lose half their hit points and gain the broken condition. Items that already possess the broken condition and fail this save are destroyed. Items that successfully save against this effect are immune to that yarahkut’s dismantling gaze for 24 hours. Unattended non-magical items don’t receive a saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Malfunctioning Aura (Su)
    desc: A yarahkut radiates a disruptive aura that is harmful to ranged weapons within 100 feet. Mechanical projectile weapons-such as crossbows, firearms, siege weapons, and many technological weapons-have a 20% chance of not firing on each attack made within the aura’s area. If a weapon in this aura has a misfire value, its misfire value increases by 2.
  - name: Wings (Ex)
    desc: A yarahkut’s wings are primary attacks.

# Description
Yarahkuts are inevitables (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 161) tasked with preventing magic and technology throughout the cosmos from falling into the wrong hands. Their mandate is to track objects that could disrupt the development of cultures that are not yet ready to wield such power. In most cases, yarahkuts monitor the movement of advanced technologies and magical items from lost civilizations, ensuring they aren’t introduced to regions where they could have a disruptive impact.

Noted for their intricate brass wings, yarahkuts have superb control of these appendages and are able to use them as effective weapons. Three identical faces surround a yarahkut’s head, staring impassively in separate directions with glowing golden eyes. Of its two sets of arms, one set bears claws for combat, while the remaining set is more humanoid and is used to manipulate objects-including those items it confiscates. A yarahkut stands 11 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.
