# Description
Infused with the power of waves and storms, sea dragons-or jiaolungs, as they are known in many lands-are draconic protectors of oceans and their creatures. Possessing tempestuous natures, sea dragons wander widely, sometimes claiming thousands of miles of ocean and coastlines as their protectorates.
