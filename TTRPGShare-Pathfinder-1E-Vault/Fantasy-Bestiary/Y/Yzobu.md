# Description
An yzobu is a herd animal found in cold hills, plains, and mountains. It stands roughly the height of a horse, but has a bulkier frame. Its head is more bovine, with a pair of thick, slightly curved horns protruding from the sides of its flat forehead and four smaller prongs jutting from the top. The fur of an yzobu is long and shaggy, protecting it from the harsh winters of its habitat. This pelt accumulates a pungent secretion from the yzobu’s body that gives it a strong odor that those unaccustomed to the creatures find sickening.

 Like the hobgoblins who use them as mounts and beasts of burden, yzobus (called “battle yaks” by their warmongering handlers) live in complex social groups. These immense herds can number in the thousands, and present quite a problem to ranchers, explorers, and pioneers who encounter them while traversing the open plains and hills where the yzobus graze. A single herd can range over a spread of tens of thousands of square miles in a year, devouring all the grass and small vegetation in the region, trampling what they can’t eat, and forcing other creatures-including humanoids- to move elsewhere or suffer the same fate.

 Yzobus are extremely aggressive, and fight ruthlessly to defend even the weakest member of their herd, making them difficult pests to deal with, and even more difficult to train for service or war. Hobgoblins have grown skilled at the process, and keep a fair number of tamed yzobus. They breed these with wild yzobus every few generations to keep them fierce.
