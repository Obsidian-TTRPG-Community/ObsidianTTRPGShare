    desc: A jungle giant is proficient with all bows, and does not provoke an attack of opportunity when firing a bow in melee combat.
  - name: Spell Storing (Su)
    desc: Once per day as a immediate action, a jungle giant can absorb a targeted or ranged touch spell used against it, negating the effects against it but not against any other targets. It can retain this stored power for up to 1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue fire. If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a free action, as if it were using a spell storing weapon. This spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This discharges the stored spell.
  - name: Warding Tattoos (Su)
    desc: A jungle giant’s magical tattoos grant it a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The giant loses this bonus if it wears armor.

# Description
Reclusive by nature, jungle giants lair deep within the rainforest. These giants distrust the ways of civilization and resent trespassers. More than one vine-covered lost city in the deep jungle owes its fall to jungle giant ire. The warrior-women of these tribes usually fight with bows, sacred weapons often passed down over generations from mother to daughter. To touch a jungle giant’s bow without permission is a mortal insult.

Jungle giants stand 17 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. Their barklike skin bears runic brands etched into each giant as a rite of passage into adulthood. Jungle giant tribes are matriarchal, ruled by an elder female warrior. Males traditionally defend the village, gather food, tend livestock, and raise children.
