    desc: When a tidepool dragon hits with a claw attack, it automatically grapples its foe, dealing automatic damage with that claw each round.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: When a tidepool dragon uses its breath weapon underwater, it creates a 10-foot cone of superheated water rather than a line of fire (as noted above). This effect deals the breath weapon’s damage to any creatures in the cone’s area, though victims can still save to take only half damage.

desc_short: This small draconic creature seems better suited for the waves than wind, its wings sweeping along its body like massive fins. Light from the water refracts off its resilient-looking cerulean hide as it snaps crustacean-like claws.

# Description
Aquatic dragons similar in size and fickleness to faerie dragons and pseudodragons, tidepool dragons rule as whimsical tyrants over miniature realms comprising coral forests, sand dune mountains, and low-tide menageries. Preferring to inhabit coastal regions throughout the world’s warmer climes, these dragon-kin make their lairs amid balmy lagoons and hidden coves, favoring any seaside setting devoid of stronger predators. A combination of chitinous shell-similar in shade to that of a blue crab-and scales the color of clear tropical waters covers every tidepool dragon, the shade deepening through twilight hues to a shade as dark as a ocean abyss.

Tidepool dragons typically measure about 2 feet long and weigh approximately 14 pounds. They are known to live for about 300 years.
