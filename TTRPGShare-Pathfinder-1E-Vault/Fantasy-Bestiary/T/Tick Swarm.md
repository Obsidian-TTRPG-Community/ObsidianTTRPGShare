special_abilities:
  - name: Cling (Ex)
    desc: If a creature leaves a tick swarmâ€™s square, the swarm takes 1d6 points of damage to reflect the loss of its numbers as several ticks cling to the victim. A creature with ticks clinging to it takes swarm damage at the end of its turn each round. As a full round action, the creature can remove the ticks with a DC 20 Reflex save. At least 10 points of damage from any area effect destroys all clinging ticks. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    desc: Bubonic Plague: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage, 1 Cha damage, fatigue; cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC is Con-based.

# Description
Tick swarms are merciless blights, able to quickly reduce the larger animal life of a region they infest to blood-drained, diseased husks.
