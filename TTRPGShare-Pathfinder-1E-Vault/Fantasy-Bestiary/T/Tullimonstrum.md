    desc: When a tullimonstrum hits with a bite attack, it automatically grapples its foe, dealing automatic bite damage each round. The tullimonstrum loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 12, but it holds on with great tenacity. While attached, a tullimonstrum has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe. An attached tullimonstrum can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to succeed at a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the tullimonstrum is dislodged.

# Description
A tullimonstrum is strange, blood-drinking, deep-sea creature displaying features of both fish and invertebrates. While tullimonstrums are relatively weak individually, a group or school of the creatures poses a lethal threat to nearly any target. A typical tullimonstrum is 14 inches long and weighs 6 pounds. Tullimonstrums can serve as familiars for spellcasters, granting their masters a +3 bonus on Perception checks.
