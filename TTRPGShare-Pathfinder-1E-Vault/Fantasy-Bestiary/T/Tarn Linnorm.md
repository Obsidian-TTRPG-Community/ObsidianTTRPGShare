special_abilities:
  - name: All-Around Vision (Ex)
    desc: A tarn linnorm’s two heads grant it a +8 racial bonus on Perception checks. It cannot be flanked.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a tarn linnorm can expel a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone of acid, dealing 22d8 points of acid damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 32 halves). This acid creates toxic fumes when it consumes organic material-on the round after a creature takes acid damage from this attack, it must make a DC 32 Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of Strength damage from the poisonous fumes (this secondary effect is a poison effect). As a full-round action, the linnorm may breathe acid with one head and bite with the other (but not use its other weapons). Alternatively, as a full-round action, it can breathe acid from both heads to create two adjacent 60-foot-long cones or two separate 120-foot-long lines. In this case it cannot use its breath weapon again for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Curse (Su)
    desc: When a creature slays a tarn linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of death.Curse of Death: save Will DC 29; effect creature can no longer be affected by healing spells and does not heal damage naturally from rest. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Freedom of Movement (Ex)
    desc: A tarn linnorm is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
  - name: Poison (Su)
    desc: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 6d6 acid damage and 1d8 Con drain; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitutuion-based.
  - name: True Seeing (Ex)
    desc: A tarn linnorm has true seeing, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.

# Description
Although legends speak of even more powerful linnorms, it’s hard to believe after witnessing the devastation a two-headed tarn linnorm can wreak. Content to slumber away the centuries at the bottom of dark mountain lakes, the tarn linnorms are true horrors that even the mightiest of heroes fear.

A tarn linnorm is 120 feet long and weighs 24,000 pounds.
