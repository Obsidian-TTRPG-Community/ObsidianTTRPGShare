  - name: Cold Aura (Su)
    desc: A thremindyr is surrounded by an aura of intense cold. At the beginning of the thremindyr’s turn, all creatures within 10 feet of the thremindyr take 1d6 points of cold damage.
  - name: Indistinct (Ex)
    desc: A thremindyr barely stands out against snow and wintery skies except when it attacks. While in cold terrain, a thremindyr can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.
  - name: Sense Protection (Su)
    desc: A thremindyr can automatically sense when a creature within 30 feet is under the effects of protection from energy (cold) or resist energy (cold).
  - name: Shatter Protection (Su)
    desc: A thremindyr can pit its intense supernatural cold against another creature’s magical protections in an attempt to wear them down or even shatter them completely. As a melee touch attack, the thremindyr can attempt to diminish the effectiveness of resist energy (cold) or protection from energy (cold) effects. If the touch attack is successful, the target is affected by a targeted dispel magic effect (caster level 11th). If the dispel check is successful, the spell protecting the target ends. This ability can affect only protection from energy (cold) or resist energy (cold) effects, and it deals no damage to the target directly.

 This ability can be used at will, but each use can affect the effects of only one spell. If the target is under the effects of both spells, this ability affects protection from energy first; a separate use of this ability is needed to remove resist energy.

 If a target is under the effects of resist energy (cold) or protection from energy (cold) as an effect of a magic item, the thremindyr’s dispel check must overcome the item’s caster level.

 Creatures with inherent resistance or immunity to cold are unaffected by this ability. This does not extend to creatures that have immunity or resistance due to the effects of magic items or spells.

# Description
Thremindyrs are often mistaken for ghosts or some manner of frozen spirits when spotted in the wild. Although they are not incorporeal, these icy elemental beings are pale and wispy, and are easily overlooked in the wintery outdoors where there is little to contrast with their translucent white bodies. If viewed against a dark backdrop, a thremindyr looks like a long-limbed humanoid. Close up, their features have an inhuman, angular, and almost crystalline quality to them. They sport high cheekbones, upward-slanted eyes, and pointed ears. What might represent hair is a swirling mass of ever-roiling tendrils of mist and snow. Thremindyrs are usually androgynous, but very rarely some thremindyrs sport what appears to be a beard composed of icicles. When agitated, these arctic elementals radiate a flurry of snow in the direction of their attention, especially when they howl and roar. They possess a considerable strength but are ephemeral, like an air elemental. Thremindyrs stand roughly 7 feet tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds.
