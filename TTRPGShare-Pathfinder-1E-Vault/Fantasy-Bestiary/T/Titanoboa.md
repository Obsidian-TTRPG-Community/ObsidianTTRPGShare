# Description
Titanoboas are deadly ambush predators, striking quickly from beneath the surface of the swamps and jungle waters they call home. Titanoboas vary in their coloration to camouflage effectively in their homes, typically patterned gray-brown and green to match the coloration of local foliage, water, and ground. 

A titanoboa is 45 feet long and weighs 2,500 pounds.
