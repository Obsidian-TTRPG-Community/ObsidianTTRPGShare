  - name: Breath Weapon (Ex)
    desc: A taniniver’s breath weapon is a hideous gray cloud of disease particles. Any creature in the area must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or contract mummy rot (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 210). The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply) and is an instantaneous effect. Ongoing saving throws against the disease use the dragon’s breath weapon DC. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    desc: A taniniver’s natural attacks infect its opponent with a random disease from the following list: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, leprosy, mindfire, or shakes. The initial saving throw against these diseases uses the breath weapon’s DC.

# Description
Taninivers are a degenerate race of diseased dragons. A taniniver’s body is alive but constantly rotting. Wracked by never-ending pain, with the stench of its own decaying flesh so strong it nearly overwhelms the vile creature’s enhanced senses, the foul taniniver spends most of its time in magical research to reverse the progression of its diseases or, failing that, to stave off further deterioration. Taninivers often ally with cults of undeath or dragonkind.
