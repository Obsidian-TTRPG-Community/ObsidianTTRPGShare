special_abilities:
  - name: Coat Claws (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, an ursikka can coat its pincerlike claws with freezing, viscous saliva. This coating lasts for 1 minute. Any creature hit by an ursikka’s coated claws or grappled by an ursikka using the Snatch feat takes an additional 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 22 half).
  - name: Freezing Saliva (Ex)
    desc: The saliva that drips from an ursikka’s mouth is sticky as well as cold, causing creatures to become entangled for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 22 negates). While entangled, creatures take 2d6 points of cold damage each round. An entangled creature can break free before the end of this duration by succeeding at a DC 19 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the encasing saliva with either a slashing weapon or fire damage. Using fire to remove the saliva damages the entangled creature as well. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Hibernation (Ex)
    desc: An ursikka can enter a prolonged state of hibernation by surrounding itself with its spittle, which hardens into a cocoon. While hibernating, an ursikka doesn’t need to drink or eat. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 60 hit points, and is immune to fire damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the ursikka remains unharmed in its hibernation. An ursikka must use its attacks to break free from its cocoon.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, an ursikka can spit a 60-foot line of its saliva. Creatures in the area take 8d6 points of cold damage and become entangled. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Ursikka are vicious apex predators that rule vast arctic territories. Held aloft by four slender legs, on which they skitter with unsettling speed, ursikka can reach heights of 25 feet, with a long, lean abdomen accounting for most of their 20-foot length. Their grasping forearms each end in a sharp pincer capable of shearing f lesh from bone, and shaggy fur covers the majority of their bodies. The ursikka’s most unusual trait, however, is a three-part maw that can open wide enough to swallow humans whole. Freezing saliva drips constantly from these gnashing mandibles, injuring and trapping prey. With only a bestial intellect, ursikka view all smaller creatures as food, and think nothing of invading and devouring entire humanoid communities.
