# Description
Undines are humans whose ancestry includes elemental beings of water, such as marids. This connection with the Plane of Water is most noticeably manifested in their coloration, which tends to mimic that of lakes or oceans-all undines have limpid, blue eyes, and their skin and hair can range from pale blue-white to the 

deep blue or green of the sea.
