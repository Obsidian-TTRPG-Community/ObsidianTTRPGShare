  - name: Psychic Starknife (Su)
    desc: After being used in a ranged attack, a uinuja’s starknife turns into a spiritual weapon (as per the spell; caster level equal to the uinuja’s Hit Dice) and immediately continues to attack the same target. An uinuja can teleport its starknife back to its hand as a move action, which ends this effect and negates the starknife’s status as a spiritual weapon

# Description
Born in Elysium from planar energies charged by pleasant dreams, these azatas watch over and study dreaming mortal minds. Uinujas live in collective mindscapes, which are often moonlit islands where rock spires rise to great heights, topped by large cocoons of dark blue silk. 

Uinujas enjoy stories about the stars and planes, particularly the Material Plane, which they can usually see only through mortals’ dreams. When uinujas are happy, their wings take on an iridescent glow, while at other times their wings take on a calmer blue or a sullen gray hue. 

An uinuja stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds
