special_abilities:
  - name: Lash (Su)
    desc: As a move action, an empusa can manifest a whip-like weapon that appears to be a coiling serpent-once manifested, the lash exists as long as the empusa carries it. A lash vanishes if it is disarmed or the empusa drops it or is slain. An empusa’s lash has a reach of 10 feet and deals 1d6 points of slashing damage on a hit. In addition, a creature damaged by the lash is affected by its toxic venom.

 Lash Venom: Lash-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Wis damage plus confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Phantasmal Vengeance (Sp)
    desc: This spell-like ability functions as phantasmal killer, save that the image it creates is of a creature or person who the viewer has wronged in their past (or of the empusa herself if there are no other appropriate options). If the target of a phantasmal vengeance fails his Fortitude save, the empusa can opt to have the victim become paralyzed for 1 hour rather than die from fear.
