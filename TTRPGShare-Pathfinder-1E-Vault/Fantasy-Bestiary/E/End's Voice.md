special_abilities:
  - name: Adaptable Life Force (Su)
    desc: Any effect that heals living creatures and harms undead or heals undead and harms living creatures (such as cure spells, inflict spells, and channeled energy) always heals the herald, even if the source of the power intended to harm it.
  - name: Contact Other Plane (Sp)
    desc: This ability functions as the spell contact other plane, but the herald can only ask questions on the behalf of another creature, the questioner (not the herald) must make the Intelligence check (if any) to avoid losing Intelligence or Charisma, and the loss is permanent rather than temporary.
  - name: Destructive Aura (Su)
    desc: As a swift action, the herald can emit a 30-foot aura of destruction for 15 rounds per day. All attacks made against targets in this aura (including the herald) gain a +7 morale bonus on damage rolls, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
  - name: Maddening Strike (Su)
    desc: If the herald successfully hits a creature with its flail, as a swift action it may force the opponent to make a DC 25 Will save. If the creature fails its save, it is confused for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Madness (Ex)
    desc: The herald uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier, and is immune to insanity and confusion effects. Only a miracle or wish can remove its madness. If this occurs, the herald gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma; it automatically reverts to its insane state 1d10 minutes later.
  - name: Telepathic Bond (Sp)
    desc: This ability functions like telepathic bond, except any creature linked to the herald’s disturbing thoughts takes 1 point of Wisdom damage every 10 minutes.

# Description
Groetus’s herald is End’s Voice, an enigmatic creature that is both more and less mysterious than its master. It looks like a giant shrouded figure floating above the ground, legless and faceless, wielding a heavy flail with ends made of glowing energy. Its visage is often confused with a reaping undead, though it is a living outsider and acts mildly insulted when others assume it to be otherwise. Its voice is hollow and distorted, as if echoing from the far end of a long metal tube, and colored with accents from ruined empires and dead languages. It rarely comes to Golarion, and for most of these visits it is merely a silent witness to a great slaughter upon the battlefield or the last gasp of a dying city, though it may strike out with its weapon or magic at a seemingly random wounded or dying target, as if making sure the creature dies as expected.

The herald may be insane from associating with Groetus, but it has a clarity unknown to mortal worshipers of the God of the End Times; perhaps its vast knowledge somehow protected it from a truly insane fate, or its status as a herald may give it a kind of lucidity that pierces the fog of madness. It does not cackle at itself like a madman, respond to unheard voices, kill for pleasure, or exhibit any of a dozen other obvious signs of insanity typically exhibited by the mad followers of Groetus.
