special_abilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, an ephialtes kyton may exhale a spread of barbed, grappling chains anchored within its massive maw, targeting up to six creatures in a 50-foot cone. Those failing a DC 27 Reflex save suffer 2d8+8 points of piercing damage and the kyton may make a combat maneuver check as an immediate action to grapple each victim with the animate chains. A successful save cuts the damage in half and avoids the grapple opportunity. Those successfully grappled by the chains become subject to the kyton’s pull ability. A kyton cannot use its breath weapon again while it is grappling or pulling creatures with its breath weapon chains. Otherwise, it may use the breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

An ephialtes kyton’s chains (hardness 10, hp 10, Break DC 26) can be broken, or attacked by making a sunder attempt. If the chain is currently grappling a target, the attacker gains a +4 circumstance bonus on the CMB check to sunder. Severing a chain deals no damage to a kyton.
  - name: Chain Armor (Ex)
    desc: The chains that adorn an ephialtes kyton grant it a +8 armor bonus, but are not treated as armor for the purpose of arcane spell failure, armor check penalties, maximum Dexterity, weight, or proficiency.
  - name: Dancing Chains (Su)
    desc: An ephialtes kyton can control up to four chains within 30 feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, the kyton can increase these chains’ length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-sharp barbs. The chains attack as effectively as the kyton itself. If a chain is in another creature’s possession, the creature can attempt a DC 22 Will save to break the ephialtes kyton’s power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the other creature’s possession. An ephialtes kyton can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making Climb checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Entrapping Chains (Su)
    desc: With a successful combat maneuver check, an ephialtes kyton may transfer an adjacent creature grappled by the kyton’s breath weapon chains to the chains adorning its body, giving the target the pinned condition while the kyton deals with remaining foes. The kyton does not retain the grappled condition while pinning such creatures. Pinned victims can free themselves with a combat maneuver check to break the pin or an Escape Artist check. Other creatures can attempt to free pinned victims by making a sunder attempt (hardness 10, hp 10). An ephialtes kyton may entrap 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.
  - name: Pull (Ex)
    desc: An ephialtes kyton has a +4 racial bonus on CMB checks made using its pull special attack.

desc_short: Amid a roiling cloud of deepest dark, the rattle of chains and heavy footfalls announce a being of immense size. An infernal, gasping hiss draws the darkness back, revealing a tortured, four-legged fiend of exposed bone and ragged flesh draped in chains. Barbs and hooks hang from these wrought iron bands, matching the fiend’s tail as they writhe like snakes in search of prey.

# Description
Sadistic hunters and tormentors of all living souls, ephialtes kytons usually roam the planes in service to the lords of Hell and Shadow, but occasionally in pursuit of their own fell interests. They ruthlessly abduct the innocent and retrieve the damned, dragging their victims into the fires of Hell or the gnashing, wailing dark of the Plane of Shadow. They have no fear, tracking their chosen prey regardless of distance or challenge, and shackle dragons, giants, and humanoids alike for their eternal torturous rewards.

Ephialtes kytons travel in silent grace while cloaked in darkness, but drop their stealthy veils when ready to intimidate those they’ve come to collect or punish. Then, their frightening gaze matches the deadly intent of the chains piercing their flesh. These animated, wrought iron bands serve as protection and weapons in the hands or claws of all kytons, but may also bind and lash their victims to the ephialtes’ ever-bleeding hide to carry them into the Great Beyond. A typical ephialtes stands 25 feet tall and weighs over 15 tons with the combined burden of their deadly chains.
