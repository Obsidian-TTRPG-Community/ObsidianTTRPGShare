special_abilities:
  - name: Empyrean Insights (Ex)
    desc: Empyreans have insight into the way creatures act, and it serves them well in battle. Empyreans gain an insight bonus to their Armor Class equal to their Charisma bonuses.
  - name: Heed No Call (Ex)
    desc: Empyreans are ancient beyond measure and directly serve the gods. They are immune to all calling spells, unless they choose to allow themselves to be called.
  - name: Lucent Arms (Ex)
    desc: An empyrean infuses its weapons with its own inner light. Any weapon an empyrean wields gains the holy and merciful special abilities. The empyrean can suppress the merciful special ability on command as normal. An empyrean needs no ammunition for its bow (or for any other ranged weapon it may possess), as it can simply fire arrows of light. An empyrean’s weapons count as having the brilliant energy special ability whenever it would be beneficial to the empyrean.
  - name: Lucent Body (Ex)
    desc: Each empyrean is formed of the ancient essence of good. Its lucent body melds perfectly with its armor and clothing, forming a single whole. An empyrean gains a sacred bonus to its Armor Class equal to the total armor bonus of its infused armor (typically +14 from infused +5 full plate), but it suffers no restrictions or penalties for wearing armor. An empyrean can never gain an armor bonus or natural armor bonus to its Armor Class through any means.
  - name: Spells

# Description
Empyreans are a race of ancient angels created by the gods before the dawn of mortalkind. Among the angelic hosts, empyreans serve outside of the usual chain of command. Standing 15 feet tall and clad in the trappings of mortality, which wrap their brilliant forms in a shape mortals and other angels can easily understand, empyreans are physical embodiments of the good energy of a deity or deific being, and they answer only to that higher power.

While other angels arise from an amalgam of good souls or the soul of an ascended mortal, the birth of a new empyrean is a momentous event, for it occurs only if another empyrean is slain. To fill the void, the remaining empyreans temporarily become receptive to the energy of good deities other than their original progenitors, which can eventually cause an empyrean to split in two. The offspring empyrean shares many of the memories and personality traits of the original, but its power is influenced by the deity who sparked its creation.

Empyreans serve as secret agents for deities-operatives who can be trusted to perform sensitive tasks, especially those that require a long view. Unlike solars, who often become slayers of great evils, empyreans rarely pick fights, but when they do, they prefer to use their deities’ favorite weapons.
