    desc: As a standard action, an ebon acolytus can attempt to force any creature it is currently grappling into a sacrificial position. The construct must make an additional combat maneuver check against its target to reposition it into an advantageous position. If it succeeds, and the victim remains grappled at the beginning of the constructâ€™s next round, the ebon acolytus may make use of its sacrifice ability. An ebon acolytus gains a +2 bonus on its CMB for the purposes of making this check if it is adjacent to an altar or similar site of ceremonial bloodletting.
  - name: Sacrifice (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, an ebon acolytus may make a coup de grace attack with its dagger against any target currently grappled into place using its prostration ability. The target is affected by the coup de grace attack and must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die as normal. If the target is killed by this attack, his soul is sent straight to the plane of the being to which the altar is dedicated, regardless of alignment, and cannot be raised from the dead except by a cleric sworn to the same deity or by a miracle or wish spell. A creature under the effects of a protection from evil spell-or similar spell that opposes the alignment of the god the ebon acolytus is cra!ed to serve-may be resurrected as normal.

desc_short: A chilling statue strands behind a dark altar, both smeared with evidence of grisly sacrifices. The monstrous statue, sculpted as a perverse amalgam of both man and beast, raises a wickedly curved sacrificial dagger above its head, its bejeweled eyes seeming to glint with murderous zeal.

# Description
Dedicated to dark gods, fiends hungry for the souls of innocents, and even more monstrous beings, ebon acolyti- sometimes called altar golems-are terrifying constructs, for they are not designed merely to kill, but to aid in the often bloody work required in the service of foul divinities. Carved from a single block of stone or other sturdy material, these constructs resemble towering statues, crafted to appear as servants of specific deities and often etched with icons sacred to their worship. In addition to its fearful body, an ebon acolytus is typically crafted with a companion altar, upon which it might aid its master or an unholy congregation in dark rites and ritual bloodletting.

The exact height and weight of an ebon acolytus varies, largely depending on the shape of its body and the quality of the stone used in its creation, though most rise to around 14 feet tall and weigh around 2,500 pounds. Some carry Large sacrificial weapons other than daggers, but these prove rare and vary between faiths.
