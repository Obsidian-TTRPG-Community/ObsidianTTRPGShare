  - name: Ether Bite (Ex)
    desc: An ether drake applies 1-1/2 × its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its bite attack, and its bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20 and has a ×3 multiplier. An ether drake’s bite deals full damage to incorporeal creatures.
  - name: Etheric Shift (Ex)
    desc: An ether drake can become ethereal (as the etherealness spell) once every 3 rounds as a swift action. The drake can activate this effect as a free action whenever it uses its speed surge ability, regardless of the number of rounds since the last time it used etheric shift. Once this ability is activated, the drake remains ethereal for 1 round.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    desc: Three times per day as a swift action, an ether drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action in that round.

# Description
Paragons among their kind, ether drakes once roamed the Ethereal Plane, where they gorged themselves on the aether at the edges of the Elemental Planes. In time, they returned to the Material Plane for reasons unknown. Lacking the malicious nature of most drakes, ether drakes are generally content to prey on animals.

When an unwelcome creature enters their territory, ether drakes use their psychic abilities to create mental links between others of their kind to coordinate and strategize. Ether drakes measure 16 feet long from head to tail and weigh around 2,000 pounds.
