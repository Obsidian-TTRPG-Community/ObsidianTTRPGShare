# Description
Most golems are animated by an elemental spirit bound within a constructed body, but some creators build their golems with a greater purpose in mind. An energized golem is infused with the raw elemental energy of the elemental spirit used to animate it, granting it increased strength and agility and a host of supernatural powers.

 The sample energized golem presented here is built using an ice golem as the base creature. See that entry for full descriptions of its base abilities.
