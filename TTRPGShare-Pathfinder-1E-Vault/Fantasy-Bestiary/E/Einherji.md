special_abilities:
  - name: Battle-Trained (Ex)
    desc: An einherji is proficient with all armor. Armor never impacts an einherji’s speed, nor does an einherji take armor check penalties on Ride checks.
  - name: Challenge of Single Combat (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, an einherji can choose a single target within sight to challenge by attempting an Intimidate check to demoralize that creature. If the check succeeds, the target is shaken and the einherji gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that target. For the duration of the challenge, the einherji must attack that target, and takes a -2 penalty to its AC, except against attacks made by the target. The challenge (and the shaken condition) remains in effect until the target successfully attacks the einherji in melee combat, the target is dead or unconscious, or the combat ends.
  - name: Thirst for Battle (Su)
    desc: As long as an einherji is in battle (i.e., each round it makes an attack roll), it gains fast healing 5. An einherji loses this ability outside of combat or if knocked unconscious.

# Description
Some warriors who die glorious deaths in battle find that there is a call for their skill and prowess even after death. Chosen by valkyries (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 277) from among the slain on the battlefield, they become einherjar, outsiders who fight for the gods and other powerful extraplanar beings in battles across the multiverse.

Like valkyries, einherjar can serve a variety of deities, not just gods of war, conf lict, and valor, but also those of love, beauty, life, and others not thought of as combative. Einherjar pride themselves on prowess in battle, and forever seek to prove themselves by challenging worthy foes.

Einherjar can be either male or female, and normally appear as muscled, battle-hardened humans, dwarves, or elves. A typical einherji stands 7 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds.
