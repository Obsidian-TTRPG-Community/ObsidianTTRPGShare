# Description
Both male and female specimens of the emperor stag exhibit the same glorious white horns, representing the quintessential game for those in Taldan high society who fancy themselves hunters. Bred for not just their impressive antlers but also their extraordinary endurance, these golden-furred deer can run for days on end through the roughest terrains, easily outpacing even the finest horses. Despite their impressive physiques, emperor stags are more cautious and timid than other deer, rarely gathering in herds, and while the emperor stags are formidable fighters when cornered, their true gifts are keen senses, speed, stealth, and steady footing.

 Since the emperor stags are generally too alert to fall prey to ambushes, popular myth suggests that the only true way to capture one is to match its legendary endurance, chasing it for days or weeks through forests, across rivers, and up rocky slopes, until the deer or the hunter finally succumbs to exhaustion. More commonly, nobles rotate packs of dogs to herd and exhaust the elusive creatures while following leisurely on horseback, later spinning fictions of their own harrowing endurance.
