    desc: standard
special_abilities:
  - name: Phrenic Disruption (Su)
    desc: An enlightened contemplative using its thought form ability can disrupt the thoughts of a creature as an incorporeal touch attack. The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will saving throw or be staggered for 1d4 rounds; multiple touches reset the duration but do not stack. At the start of a turn in which it is staggered by this ability, a creature must succeed at a second Will saving throw or take 1 point of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Psychic Buffer (Su)
    desc: An enlightened contemplative generates a field of mental interference that absorbs hostile attacks. Whenever the enlightened contemplative would take hit point damage from a mind-affecting effect, it reduces the damage taken by 5. In addition, it adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its Armor Class.
  - name: Thought Form (Su)
    desc: As a move action, an enlightened contemplative can transform into a translucent figure of pure thought, during which time it is incorporeal and can use its phrenic disruption ability. It can remain in this form for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice (typically 9 rounds). If the effect ends while the enlightened contemplative is in a space it could not otherwise occupy, it takes 3d6 points of damage and is shunted to the nearest open space it could occupy.

# Description
Long ago, Akiton’s legendary Contemplatives of Ashok (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds 60) were a race of relatively ordinary humanoids. As they came into the fullness of their intelligence, however, they unlocked great psychic abilities that slowly rendered their bodies unnecessary, resulting in a quick evolutionary march toward their current forms-floating brains attached to withered, vestigial bodies.

Now in direct control of their own evolutionary progress, most contemplatives choose to advance methodically and scientifically. Yet a small subset engaged in daring research into occultism and the Esoteric Planes favor a more reckless approach. The most impressive discoveries of these self-styled “enlightened” individuals allow them to transcend the material world’s limitations for brief periods of time, much to the chagrin of more conservative contemplatives, who prefer to pursue less radical methods than their peers.
