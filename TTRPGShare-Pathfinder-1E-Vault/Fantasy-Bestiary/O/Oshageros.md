special_abilities:
  - name: Draining Tentacles (Ex)
    desc: An oshageros’s tentacles flicker with chaotic energies that sap the vigor of those they strike. A creature struck by a tentacle takes 1 point of Dexterity drain and is staggered for 1 round; this effect is negated with a successful DC 24 Fortitude save, but a new saving throw must be attempted for each tentacle hit. The duration of the staggered effect stacks with multiple hits. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Warpwave Burst (Su)
    desc: As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, an oshageros can unleash a powerful chaotic force in a 20-foot radius burst centered on itself. This burst affects all creatures in the area save for other proteans. Affected creatures are struck by a warpwave (see page 306) and are staggered for 1 round. A successful DC 24 Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
