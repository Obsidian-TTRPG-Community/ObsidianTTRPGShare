special_abilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    desc: When an obsidian golem is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes. All creatures within a 20-foot burst take 12d6 points of piercing and slashing damage and 2d6 points of bleed damage. A successful DC 18 Reflex save results in half damage and negates the bleed effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    desc: An obsidian golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals fire damage sharpens the obsidian golem’s claws, increasing their critical threat range to 18-20 and increasing bleed damage to 3d6 for 1d4+1 rounds. • A magical attack that deals cold damage cakes ice over the obsidian golem’s form, suppressing the bleed damage from its claw attacks and negating its jagged body ability for 1 round. • A stone to flesh spell negates the golem’s damage reduction, jagged body, and immunity to magic for 1 full round.
  - name: Jagged Body (Ex)
    desc: A creature that grapples an obsidian golem or that hits it with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 2d6 points of bleed damage.
  - name: Obsidian Spray (Ex)
    desc: As a swift action every 1d4+1 rounds, an obsidian golem can unleash a torrent of obsidian shards, filling a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in this attack take 8d6 points of piercing and slashing damage and 2d6 points of bleed damage. A DC 18 Reflex save reduces this damage by half and negates the bleed effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
