special_abilities:
  - name: Calcifying Touch (Su)
    desc: An incorporeal ozimat’s touch can partially petrify a living creature’s body, dealing 1d8 points of Dexterity damage. When reduced to 0 Dexterity in this way, an affected creature is petrified for 24 hours. A petrified Medium creature can serve as a stone receptacle for the ozimat’s earthen host ability; if used in this manner, it doubles the length of time the ozimat can remain in that form.
  - name: Earthen Host (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, an ozimat can merge with a body of inert earth or stone, shedding its incorporeality. The form must be roughly the size of a Medium creature. A merged ozimat loses its incorporeal subtype (plus all incorporeal special qualities, including its deflection bonus to AC) and its fly speed, but gains a Strength score of 24, a +8 natural armor bonus (AC 24, touch 16, flat-footed 18), DR 5/-, and Improved Bull Rush and Power Attack as bonus feats. In earthen form, an ozimat gains 2 slam attacks with a +23 bonus to hit, each dealing 3d6+7 points of damage, but cannot use its calcifying touch. Its hit points do not change. An ozimat can maintain its earthen form for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice (typically 16).

# Description
Earth elementals are useful for the creation of golems, as their stoic demeanor ensures the longest lasting bond between body and animate force. When a golem is destroyed but the elemental spirit survives, ozimats are the result. Still, those that endure the agony of this experience can ascend to become relatively tranquil beings.
