special_abilities:
  - name: Blinding Pulse (Ex)
    desc: As a move action, the prismatic orrery can set its lenses to refract the light of the prismatic sphere at its center, granting it a gaze attack that causes blindness in all targets that fail a DC 19 Fortitude saving throw. This gaze attack can be disabled as a move action, and is automatically disabled if the orrery uses its prismatic refraction ability or if the prismatic sphere is temporarily dispelled. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Dispel Resistance (Su)
    desc: The prismatic sphere at the center of the orrery (CL 20th) can be dispelled with a targeted dispel magic spell, but only temporarily. As the sphere is fueled by the elemental energies within the Prismatic Lanternâ€™s demiplane, it reappears after 1d3 rounds. While the prismatic sphere is inactive, the prismatic orrery cannot use its blinding pulse and prismatic refraction abilities.
  - name: Prismatic Refraction (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, the prismatic orrery can position its many rings and lenses such that the magical energy of the prismatic sphere at its center is aimed in a series of beams at all targets within 60 feet. These beams take the form of a prismatic spray spell (CL 13th); determine the color of each ray randomly with a roll of 1d8 as indicated in the spell. A prismatic refraction ray is a ranged touch attack with a +17 bonus to hit and a save DC of 21. It takes the prismatic orrery 1d4 rounds to recalibrate its lenses to recharge this ability. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
