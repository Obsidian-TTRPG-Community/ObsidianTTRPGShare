# Description
A pipefox is a foot-long, furry, magical snake with the head of a fox. Often found either climbing in trees or snaking around pipes, these curious and stealthy creatures prefer to skulk about to observe and learn. Neither malicious nor particularly beneficial, pipefoxes love to gather knowledge and sometimes disseminate what they’ve acquired to those they find worthy.

Desirous of knowledge, no matter how obscure, these creatures only see other like-minded creatures worthy of their interaction. Though they might become curious about a tribe of barbarians, take sudden interest in learning the cant of a local group of thieves, or even study the method of distribution for the local brewery, they watch such things from a distance, never interacting with such “lesser minds.” But if a pipefox finds a creature that loves knowledge as much as it does, it becomes intrigued, and after spending a period of time observing such a creature, will eventually muster up the courage to make the relationship more personal. Many pipefoxes are especially intrigued by spellcasters, and sometimes they offer to serve them as either familiars or confidants.

Pipefoxes are secretive by nature, and even when they make themselves known, they can be shy and evasive, both physically and intellectually. They often see knowledge as a type of spiritual currency, and are hesitant to give their knowledge away unless they gain something in return.

Some believe pipefoxes are the spirits of legendary scribes and lore masters given new form. Others believe the creatures are related to kami, and serve to preserve the world’s knowledge.

A spellcaster of at least 7th level who has the Improved Familiar feat may select the pipefox as a familiar, but only after the pipefox has agreed to pledge its services to the spellcaster.
