special_abilities:
  - name: Chain-Spear (Ex)
    desc: A painajai can hurl its spear at a target within 50 feet with no range penalty. If the attack hits, the painajai can immediately yank the chain to attempt a repositionAPG or trip combat maneuver check against the target. The painajai is considered to have the Improved RepositionAPG and Improved Trip feats when performing these maneuvers with its spear only. A reposition combat maneuver performed in this way can only move the target closer to the painajai. The painajai can recover its spear as a swift action.

    desc: A painajai can travel between the Abyss and the Dimension of Dreams at will, as per dream travelOA, except that it cannot enter any other planes or take other creatures with it.

# Description
Lamashtu created the painajai demons to haunt mortal dreams and watch their nightmares, as well as to hunt lone uinuja azatas (see page 9). Though painajais far outnumber uinujas, the demons’ inability to cooperate keeps them from gaining the upper hand in their eternal struggle. These demons also indiscriminately attack anyone crossing their path, including dream travelers and other painajais, and only an overseer of overwhelming strength can prevent them from doing so. Painajais speak in a throaty and resonating voice that seems to abrade any ear upon which it falls. They grind their sharp teeth compulsively, sometimes on purpose to unnerve their opponents, and may even chew on the insides of their cheeks to produce a bloody, filthy froth.

Painajais stand 10 feet tall and weigh about 800 pounds. These demons form from the souls of mortals whose cruel deeds have caused nightmares in other people.
