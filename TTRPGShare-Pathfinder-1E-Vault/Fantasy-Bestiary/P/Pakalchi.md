special_abilities:
  - name: Entangling Train (Su)
    desc: Creatures adjacent to a pakalchi must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or become entangled in its vines for 1 round, and count as tethered. Entangled creatures take vine damage automatically each round they’re entangled. Creatures are no longer entangled if the pakalchi moves away. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Look of Fear (Su)
    desc: A creature affected by a pakalchi’s gaze is panicked for 1 round and shaken for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is only shaken for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Thorns-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Wis damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. A creature with Wisdom damage from a pakalchi’s poison hears paranoid whispers warning of betrayal. It can’t treat any other creature as an ally or be a willing target for a spell or effect. This is an emotion effect.
  - name: Sudden Strike (Ex)
    desc: Once per round, a pakalchi can extend the reach of one claw or thorned vine by 5 feet as part of a single attack. It can use this ability to threaten additional squares to cause an enemy to provoke an attack of opportunity.
  - name: Thorns (Ex)
    desc: A pakalchi can fling a volley of poisonous thorns as a standard action (make an attack roll for each thorn). This attack has a range of 100 feet with no range increment.

# Description
Pakalchis feed on the fear and insecurity of failing relationships. They delight in seeing social bonds shatter, as they know that mortals broken or set adrift by such conf licts are more susceptible to their malign inf luence. Consummate puppetmasters, pakalchis use their powers of domination to turn friends and lovers against each other, relishing how even a single word can cause an avalanche of destruction as panicked victims make their situations worse. Pakalchis then draw the despondent mortals to their sides, playing cat-and-mouse games and slowly increasing physical and psychological pressure until their quarry breaks.

 While they may sometimes work though intermediaries, these creatures prefer to personally witness the anxiety they cause. Pakalchis stand 7 feet tall and weigh 160 pounds.
