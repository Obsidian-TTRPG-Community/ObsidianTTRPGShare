Treat electrolocation as blindsight 30 feet, but platypuses can sense only living creatures, and it functions only underwater.

# Description
Platypuses are members of an extremely unusual order of egg-laying mammals that live in riverside burrows where they hunt for larvae, shellfish, and worms. Platypuses also have a remarkable electrical sense they use in place of hearing, scent, and sight while hunting underwater.

 The average platypus is roughly 1-1/2 feet long and weighs 3-1/2 pounds.
