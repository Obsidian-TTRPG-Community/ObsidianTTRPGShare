    desc: When a bore worm monarch burrows, it can move through solid material, including stone and metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. It leaves behind a 5-foot-diameter, smooth-sided tunnel coated in acid that deals 1d3 points of acid damage to creatures coming into contact with its surface. This acid lasts a number of rounds equal to the hardness of material it burrowed through.

A single, finger-length bore worm has never been much of a threat to any one creature, but isolated bore worms are found only in laboratories. Bore worm swarms, as they are more commonly encountered, consume organic material with a voracious appetite, tunneling through the earth like water as they reach progressively larger sizes.
