  - name: Puppet Ruler (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, a bramble throne can thrust psychically empowered tendrils into any Small, Medium, or Large creature seated on its throne that has been dead for less than 1 minute. The corpse becomes a zombie-like creature, but it isn’t treated as being undead and is immune to spells and effects that affect only undead (including damage from positive energy). The puppet ruler shares the bramble throne’s space, moves with it, and can make attacks independently of the bramble throne. If the bramble throne removes its tendrils as a move action, or if the puppet ruler is removed from the throne, it reverts to an ordinary corpse. The puppet ruler has cover while on the throne, but attackers can otherwise attack either the bramble throne or the puppet ruler freely. Area-effect spells affect both the bramble throne and puppet ruler. Killing the bramble throne destroys the puppet ruler.
  - name: Supplication Aura (Su)
    desc: While the bramble throne is using its puppet ruler ability, any creature that begins its turn within 30 feet of the bramble throne must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or fall prone and become fascinated by the puppet on the throne for 1 round, viewing it as a ruler worthy of adoration. A creature affected by this ability does not view either the bramble throne or the puppet as a potential threat, but an attack by either the bramble throne or the puppet ends the fascination. This is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Vines (Ex)
    desc: A bramble throne’s barbed vines are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and piercing damage. A bramble throne doesn’t gain the grappled condition when grappling enemies with its vines and can maintain grapples with any number of its vines with the same standard action.

# Description
Bramble thrones grow where the blood of power-hungry rulers has been spilled, and particularly where the bodies of these grasping monarchs have been laid to rest. A ruler’s obsession over the power of a throne can be so powerful that it leaches into the soil, infusing a growing tree with a psychic fixation on the trappings of rule and powers of domination. As the plant grows, its branches form into the shape of the ruler’s throne and its leaves sprout in regal colors such as gold and violet.

 A bramble throne’s wide trunk typically rises only 2 feet above ground before branching into a throne 8 feet wide and 10 feet high. Leaves surround the throne like an ornate canopy, and several thick, barbed vines wind around the entire tree. A bramble throne can slowly pull itself along the ground with these vines, although it more frequently uses them to lash out at creatures that stray within the range of its psychic senses. If it kills an intelligent creature, it seats the corpse upon the throne, using invasive tendrils to give the corpse the semblance of animation and regal authority. With a corpse seated upon it, a bramble throne can compel other creatures to make the obeisance it craves.

 Bramble thrones retain an echo of the ruler’s imperious nature, allowing it to speak basic commands such as “approach,” “bow,” and “kneel” through a jagged, mouth-like slit in its trunk. Bramble thrones speak whatever languages the ruler knew in life.

 Bramble thrones grow up to 12 feet wide and 20 feet high and weigh about 4,000 pounds.
