special_abilities:
  - name: Daemonic Harbinger Traits
    desc: A daemonic harbinger is a powerful daemon that has not yet made the full transition from unique daemon to a horseman. It has several traits, as summarized here. Immunity to acid, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, and poison. Resistance to cold 30, electricity 30, and fire 30. Telepathy 300 feet. The harbinger's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The harbinger can grant spells to its worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on its behalf. Braismois grants access to the domains of Evil, Knowledge, Rune and Trickery. His favored weapon is the light mace.
  - name: Deft of Hand (Ex)
    desc: Braismois wields his quill as both an instrument of ensnarement and a deadly weapon. He always adds his Dexterity bonus to damage rolls with his toxic quill. In addition, Braismois can add his Dexterity bonus to any skill check related to writing. As a swift action, Braismois can attempt a Profession (barrister) check to write a full contract for any situation. The result of this check is the DC for creatures attempting a Linguistics or Profession (barrister) check to identify loopholes or flaws within the contract in Braismois's favor.
  - name: Fine Print Aura (Su)
    desc: All written texts within the radius of this aura become unintelligibly dense and convoluted. Scrolls used within the aura automatically risk a mishap; the DC of the Wisdom check required to negate the mishap is 15 instead of DC 5. A scroll's user can spend a move action to attempt a DC 30 Linguistics or Profession (barrister) check to parse the text and use the scroll normally; failing this check results in a mishap.
  - name: Toxic Quill (Su)
    desc: Braismois's quill is a manifestation of his spirit and is treated as a +5 dagger that functions as a natural attack and deals 3d6 points of piercing damage on a hit. Braismois can throw the quill as a ranged attack against any creature within 120 feet. As a full-round action, he can instead make a ranged attack against all foes within 60 feet. Braismois can instantly re-form his toxic quill as a free action. For each attack Braismois makes with the quill, he can select one of the following poisons to apply to the attack. If the attack is a confirmed critical hit, the DC of the poison increases by 6 and can affect creatures with poison immunity. The save DCs are Constitution-based. Broken Oath: injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/minute for 10 minutes; effect 1d6 Wis and controlled by Braismois as per dominate monster for the duration of the poison; cure 2 consecutive saves. Promise of Power: injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 2/round for 3 rounds; effect 2d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves or agree to telepathically transmitted contract with Braismois, which acts as a geas and instantly heals the applied ability damage. Silence: injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 2d4 Con damage and cannot speak until the ability damage is healed; cure 2 consecutive saves.

# Description
Braismois, the Silent Quill, sometimes referred to as the Toxic Quill by those misinterpreting his weapon as his title, is the daemonic harbinger of broken deals, fine print, and unfair bargains. A being of immense power, Braismois currently serves Trelmarixian, the Horseman of Famine, though only to fulfill an ongoing contract with the horseman. Braismois appears as a frostbitten human with weasel-like features, bedecked in ink-smeared clothing. His followers are generally administrators, barristers, clerks, or those highly placed in judicial or political environments. Braismois preys on mortals unable to fully grasp his contracts, though he enjoys a challenge and seeks out haughty nobles or intellectuals who believe themselves immune to such treachery. He frequently appears to powerful and influential mortals to seed contracts and deals across the Material Plane.

 The harbinger of broken deals rules from the Silent Nation, an expansive set of tunnels dug into the bottom of a glacier in Abaddon. Deep within the glacier, Braismois maintains a vast library of all the contacts and documentation on his various schemes throughout the cosmos, with each plane and world tended to by its own unique bibliodaemon caretaker. Braismois also keeps the true versions of many historical records that he and his agents have altered or replaced over the years as vainglorious trophies within his archival sanctum.

 Those who serve Braismois in life end up as hunted petitioners doomed to roam the mazelike tunnels of the Silent Nation’s lowest depths. Petitioners struggle eternally to decipher detailed but purposely inaccurate directions carved into the walls; those who fail to recognize the directions as falsehoods wander forever, those who recognize them as lies are quickly consumed by warden daemons, and those who put up misleading directions of their own to lead others into harm are elevated to the ranks of lesser daemonhood.

 Over a century ago, Braismois turned his attention to the nation of Druma and its Kalistocracy. A member of the esteemed Petronax family had come to learn the truth of the Kalistocracy’s promised afterlife and saw it as little more than delaying an inevitable judgment by Pharasma. This prophet betrayed the Kalistocracy and, using ancient Kellid rituals and profane tools uncovered in the Palakar Forest, communed with Braismois to share the discovery. Braismois fumed at the Kalistocracy’s subversion of death, as any daemon would in their role as the wouldbe enders of all life. Having learned one of the greatest secrets on Golarion, Braismois has kept the information to himself, using the well-positioned Petronax family to weaken the Kalistocracy and pave the way for a daemonic incursion into the heart of the nation. It is through this culminating scheme that Braismois hopes to unearth the hidden tombs of Kalistrade’s prophets and gorge on the untold number of souls removed from the cycle of death-an act that Braismois hopes will grant him enough power to challenge and supplant Charon as the Horseman of Death.
