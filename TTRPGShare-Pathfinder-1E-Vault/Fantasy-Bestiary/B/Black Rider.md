# Description
The Black Rider has the most forbidding appearance of the Three Riders. He always appears in a frightening form when called to service. His judgments are the least recorded in history, as they are all performed under the cover of night, and many Irriseni citizens blame other vicious creatures and strange occurrences for the disappearance of their fellow citizens.
