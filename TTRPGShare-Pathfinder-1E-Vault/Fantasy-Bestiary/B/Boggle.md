special_abilities:
  - name: Mindboggle Aura (Su)
    desc: A boggle is swathed in a 30-foot aura of supernatural mirth. The first time a creature ends its turn within this area, it must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be overcome by a sense of absurdity, taking a -10 penalty on Sense Motive and Perception checks and a -2 penalty on initiative checks. Spellcasters must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) to cast spells while affected due to the extreme distraction. This effect persists for 13 minutes, even if a creature leaves the aura. A creature that successfully saves against the aura can’t be affected by the same boggle’s mindboggle aura for 24 hours. This is an emotion-based, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Boggles are frenetic and capricious fey who love to run and cavort through the woods, pulling pranks on animals, people, monsters, and their fellow fey. What these country cousins to bogeymen love more than anything, though, is the humor and laughter of mortals. When bored, a boggle randomly selects a person or family to befriend and begins a campaign of pranks and teasing; the boggle usually neglects to introduce itself to these new friends, remaining hidden to heighten the growing panic and make the game more hilarious. Its innate magic creates strange lights and sounds and causes erratic behavior, adding to the mortals’ dread. 

A boggle stands 3 feet tall and weighs 55 pounds.
