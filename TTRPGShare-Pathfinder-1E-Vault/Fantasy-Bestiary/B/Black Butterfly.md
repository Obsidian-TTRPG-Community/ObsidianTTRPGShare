special_abilities:
  - name: Celestial Grace (Ex)
    desc: Black Butterfly adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to her damage rolls with all melee and ranged weapons. She gains an insight bonus to her Armor Class equal to her Wisdom modifier. She ignores any effect that would reduce her movement speed or prevent her from taking a 5-foot step.
  - name: Interstellar Mastery (Ex)
    desc: Black Butterfly never suffers any harmful environmental effects from outer space. She gains a +4 sacred bonus on attack rolls and saving throws when in such an environment, as well as the benefits of a ranger’s favored terrain (+10 bonus).
  - name: Primal Aura (Su)
    desc: No sounds pass through Black Butterfly’s primal aura except those she allows, and even then, she can choose to block a sound in some portions of her aura while allowing it to pass through other portions. When blocking sound, this aura functions similarly to silence. This ability is suppressed for 1d4 rounds whenever Black Butterfly is affected by a vision-based effect created by an evil creature.
  - name: Silence Between (Ex)
    desc: When Black Butterfly takes a 5-foot step, instead of moving 5 feet, she can ride the spaces in between breaths and thoughts, disappearing and rematerializing anywhere within 150 feet and attempting a Stealth check to hide as a free action. She can hide even when being directly observed, and her Stealth can defeat any sense (for example blindsight, lifesense, and tremorsense) as long as the result of the check exceeds the result of the observer’s Perception check. She gains an additional +20 bonus on Stealth checks (+40 when immobile), which doesn’t stack with the bonuses from invisibility, and she can’t be outlined by spells like faerie fire or glitterdust. If she is hidden when she begins a full attack, any creature that wasn’t observing her is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against all attacks in the full attack, not just the first attack. Black Butterfly loses access to her silence between ability when she is in an area of bright light.
  - name: Starflight (Su)
    desc: Although she can use interplanetary teleport at will, Black Butterfly enjoys flying between the stars. When she does so, she travels at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM’s discretion). Black Butterfly knows the routes to all destinations among the stars.
  - name: Steal Breath (Su)
    desc: Black Butterfly’s touch attack deals 10d6 points of cold damage and draws the breath from the target’s lungs as she subjects the creature to the racking conditions of deep space. The creature struck can resist having its breath drawn out with a successful DC 37 Fortitude save; otherwise, the target is knocked unconscious by the sudden loss of oxygen. Steal breath does not harm creatures that do not breathe, but her touch attack can still deal cold damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Voidsedge Bond (Ex)
    desc: Voidsedge is a +5 aberration-bane ghost touch holy starknife that exists as one of the stars in Black Butterfly’s wings until she calls it to her hand as a free action. When she throws Voidsedge, it returns to her hand instantly upon striking a target, allowing her to make iterative thrown attacks. Her range increment with Voidsedge is 120 feet. Attacks with Voidsedge deal an additional 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of cold damage on a hit when Black Butterfly wields the weapon.

# Description
Black Butterfly, the Silence Between, arose from the spaces between the stars. Solemn and serene, she never acts rashly, relying on the wisdom of the cosmos to guide her to the appropriate solution. She believes that the true nature of the multiverse lies in the gaps and silences between thoughts and ideas, so she never focuses on one topic or idea for too long, lest in narrowing her view she should lose sight of the space beyond the idea’s edge. 

On Elysium, Black Butterfly’s hidden realm is nestled in the constellation that leads to Desna’s palace. Her realm is relatively simple for an empyreal lord, with no grand palace or bright colors. Instead, it is a quiet respite from a plane of riotous passions, a gentle void, breathable by creatures of all sorts, with pockets of solid shadow for those who prefer ground beneath their feet and dotted with simple shelters. Her realm is so difficult to find that even planar scholars and other residents of Elysium can’t agree exactly where it lies, though travelers through silence and darkness, even on other planes, sometimes make their way into her realm in times of desperation, able to find momentary succor so long as they are respectful and quiet. 

While few beings can match her knowledge of the alien monstrosities that dwell in the deepest reaches of interstellar space, Black Butterfly refuses to share much of it, as she worries that widespread knowledge of her greatest nemeses, the Outer Gods and the Great Old Ones, would serve their interests rather than hers. She often journeys from her home in Elysium to subtly battle the interests of these foes and other forces of evil, or to assist those in need without revealing her presence.
