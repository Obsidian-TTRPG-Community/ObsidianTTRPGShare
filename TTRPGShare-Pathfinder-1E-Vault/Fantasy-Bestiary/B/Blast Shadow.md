If the blast shadow takes any cold damage, this cloud is dispelled and canâ€™t be activated again for 1d6 rounds.
  - name: Death Burst (Su)
    desc: When a blast shadow is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes in a blast of flame. All creatures within 30 feet take 5d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Nethys Note: The blast shadow was not given a description. The following is reprinted from its entry in Pathfinder #15: The Armageddon Echo

Death by fire is a horrible fate, but far worse is death by a fiery apocalypse. While most are incinerated by such conflagrations, others are infused with the energy of that terrible act and rise again as blast shadows. These undead creatures linger on after the inferno, seeking to spread their pain to the living. Blast shadows haunt the wastelands that spawned them, waiting for victims to come and learn of the catastrophe. Only then do they strike out from the shadows to show them the horrors up close.

Blast shadows typically have the form of the creatures they were in life, though scorched and withered by their fiery deaths. Little more than humanoid skeletons with bits of flesh and hair fused to charred bones, blast shadows usually weigh little more than 60 pounds, and stand at a height typical for the race of which they were formerly members.
