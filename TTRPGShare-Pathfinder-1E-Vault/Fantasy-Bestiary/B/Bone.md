    desc: All creatures within 30 feet of a bone idol gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against disease and poison. The effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the bone idol’s aura.
  - name: Mad Rage (Su)
    desc: Any creature bitten by a bone idol must make a DC 16 Will save or fly into an uncontrollable, violent rage. Those affected by this rage are treated as being under the effects of both the spells rage and confusion for 1 minute. However, whenever the affected creature rolls a confusion result that would lead it to flee or attack the bone idol, the idol instead chooses a target for it to attack. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Zombie Fetish (Su)
    desc: Any zombie created within 30 feet of a bone idol rises as a fast zombie (see page 289 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for details).

desc_short: This tiny, grisly fetish seems to be carved from numerous pieces of bone, adorned with a necklace of teeth and caked with a thin layer of dried blood. Hair and twine bind the pieces of bone together. The thing’s misshapen head leers forward, carved with a demonic, ape-like grin.

# Description
Carved from human and animal bones and stitched together with hair, bone idols serve as grisly fetishes and totems for cannibalistic tribes. Although a number of small, nameless tribes carve bone idols in honor of obscure gods of disease and beastliness, most bone idols are fashioned to resemble the fearsome, simian appearance of Angazhan, the demon lord of apes and jungles.
