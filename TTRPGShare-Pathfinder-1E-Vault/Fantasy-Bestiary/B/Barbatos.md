    desc: triple (Eyjatas, other treasure)
special_abilities:
  - name: Barbed Beard (Ex)
    desc: The bleeding caused by Barbatos's slashing beard requires a successful DC 39 Heal check (or caster level check, for magical healing) to stanch. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Counterport (Su)
    desc: As an immediate action, Barbatos can negate any conjuration (calling, summoning, or teleportation), effect within 30 feet, or redirect creatures to new valid destinations within 30 feet. Affected creatures take 10d6 points of damage, but with a successful DC 35 Fortitude save, a creature takes only half damage and can teleport normally. As a standard action, Barbatos can recall one creature that teleported since the end of his last turn. This functions as above, but the creature returns to the point from which it teleported (or the nearest available space, if that space is now occupied); the teleported creature can resist being recalled with a successful DC 35 Will save. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Festering Filth (Su)
    desc: A creature struck by Barbatos's filthy beard contracts blinding sickness (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557) if it fails a DC 39 Fortitude save. Attempts to remove this disease via a spell effect must first overcome Barbatos's spell resistance before attempting to remove the disease normally as per the spell's rules. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Hear Name (Su)
    desc: Barbatos hears his name when it is spoken, regardless of distance and even across planar boundaries. If a creature speaks Barbatos's name three times in the same breath, Barbatos learns the creature's name and precise location, and can hear the next 21 words spoken by that speaker. Once per day, if any living animal or an image or statue of Barbatos is within 10 feet of the speaker, Barbatos can answer the speaker via that image, statue, or animal (an animal can resist being made Barbatos's mouthpiece with a successful DC 35 Will save). Barbatos can observe, converse, or utilize his spell-like abilities through this vessel for up to 13 rounds, but if Barbatos uses a spell-like ability through this link, the connection immediately ends thereafter, regardless of any remaining duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Sphere of Souls (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, even when he is projecting his consciousness through his likeness or an animal, Barbatos can create a polished black crystal sphere that functions as a crystal ball with detect thoughts, which also grants him the benefits of status for 13 hours on one creature scried by the user. Each round a creature other than Barbatos uses the sphere, it must save against Barbatos's dominate person ability. Barbatos can freely manipulate the vision the scryer sees, as false vision, and can use detect thoughts and scrying at unlimited range on any creature within 10 feet of the sphere, with no save and with a +10 bonus on caster level checks. Effects that normally block scrying spells instead allow each creature a saving throw and negate the bonus on caster level checks. Barbatos can have up to 13 such spheres at a time, and can destroy a sphere as a free action from any distance.

# Description
Barbatos is a mystery among the lords of Hell, a being from beyond who came into the service of Asmodeus a mere millennium ago. Technically not a devil, Barbatos is nonetheless the archdevil of the uppermost layer of Hell. Since his arrival, he has served as the doorwarden of Hell, guarding its outer layer from angelic invasions and fiendish forays alike, and dealing with an endless stream of damned souls needing guidance to their final purgatory and tearful petitioners willing to risk everything for one final glimpse of their lost loves. 

Barbatos dresses plainly, rarely showing more than his wicked staff and rumpled cloak, and stands 5 feet tall
