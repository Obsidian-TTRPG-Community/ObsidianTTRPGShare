# Description
These massive plant juggernauts were not created by nature, but grown by druids who use them as protectors and dispensers of savage judgment. Pruned into a form resembling a stout ram, a barometz is granted a degree of intelligence by natural spirits bound into its verdant bulk.

Barometzes are typically found in the service of the powerful druids who cultivate them and help them protect sacred primeval forests.
