    desc: A boreal annis hag does not leave a trail in snow and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.

Though boreal creatures mostly resemble their temperate kin, the effects of sorcerous winter have bolstered them, making them stronger and much more dangerous. In basic shape and form they appear similar to their ancestors, but other characteristics reveal the creaturesâ€™ altered nature. Their fur and skin are much paler, often shades of blue, gray, or simply white, and it is not uncommon for parts of these creatures to be cloaked in frost, especially their jagged claws and shaggy hair.
