# Description
The squat cave scorpion is quite well suited for life in caves. With its bulky armor, a cave scorpion at rest looks like a pile of stones. The cave scorpionâ€™s favorite food is dwarven meat, and when a cave scorpion finds a working dwarven mine, it can quickly become a major inconvenience. Dwarven societies often post hefty bounties on cave scorpion stingers.
