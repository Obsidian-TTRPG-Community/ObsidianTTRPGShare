special_abilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    desc: A corpse lotus can blend in exceptionally well with vegetated areas when not taking any actions. In such an area, a creature must make a successful DC 30 Perception check to recognize a corpse lotus for what it is before the corpse lotus attacks the first time.
  - name: Digest Corpse (Su)
    desc: A corpse lotus can consume a corpse to quickly heal damage it has taken. As a standard action, a corpse lotus can swallow any corpse within reach that still has flesh attached to grant itself fast healing 10 for 1 minute. Any living creature killed by a corpse lotus’s swallow whole ability automatically triggers this ability. A corpse lotus must wait until 1 minute after its fast healing has ended before it can use this ability again.
  - name: Preserving Mists (Su)
    desc: Corpse lotuses emanate a fine mist that spreads across the ground to a range of 30 feet. Any corpse within this area is affected as if by gentle repose (CL 1st).
  - name: Vines (Ex)
    desc: A corpse lotus’s vines are primary natural attacks with the grab ability. A corpse lotus doesn’t gain the grappled condition when grappling enemies with its vines and can maintain grapples with any number of its vines with the same standard action.

# Description
A corpse lotus begins life as a small flowering plant that blooms near carrion, and if given enough time, it grows into an incredibly large and dangerous monstrosity. This terrifying plant possesses grasping vines capable of pummeling opponents before dragging them toward its maw. Always found where carcasses are abundant, corpse lotuses have been known to grow in dungeons, ruins, graveyards, and battlefields in addition to more typical wooded or marshy locales.

Every corpse lotus has a single bulbous flower in its center, similar in shape to a lotus flower. The blossom’s petals are blood-red, and hide an acidic maw at the flower’s center. Corpse lotuses in different regions tend to resemble the dominant plant species in the surrounding area (with the exception of their distinct red petals), thus granting the plants natural camouflage and enabling them to hide among native foliage. Their vines are thick and writhe madly when reaching for potential prey. Corpse lotuses gain their name from the gardens of dead bodies that frequently surround these large, predatory plants-usually of animals and humanoids that strayed too close to the lotus and met their deaths within its gullet.

While at rest, a corpse lotus can reach 8 feet in height and splay its leaves nearly 15 feet wide.
