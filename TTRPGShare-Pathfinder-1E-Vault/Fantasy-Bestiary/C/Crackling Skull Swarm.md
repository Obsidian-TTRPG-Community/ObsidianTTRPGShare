special_abilities:
  - name: Bone Shards (Su)
    desc: When a clacking skull swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, it unleashes an explosion of foul energy and bone fragments. Creatures within 30 feet of the clacking skull swarm take 8d8 points of damage (Reflex DC 21 half). Half of this damage is piercing damage, and half is negative energy damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Chattering Teeth (Su)
    desc: As a free action, a clacking skull swarm can begin emitting a cacophony of chattering. Each creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same clacking skull swarm’s chattering teeth for 24 hours. The clacking skull swarm can stop this ability as a free action. This is a sonic, mindaffecting, compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Frightening Scream (Su)
    desc: A clacking skull swarm can emit a terrifying scream as a free action once every 1d4 rounds. Each creature within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. A clacking skull swarm can’t scream while using its chattering teeth. This is a sonic, mind-affecting, fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
