# Description
A cervine protector might be encountered alongside the Grim White Stag, or as the companion of one of Erastilâ€™s clergy. In natural settings sacred to Erastil, solitary cervine protectors sometimes stand vigil, ensuring that no taint befalls their charge.

 Characters with the Leadership feat can take a cervine protector as a cohort at cohort level 10th or higher.
