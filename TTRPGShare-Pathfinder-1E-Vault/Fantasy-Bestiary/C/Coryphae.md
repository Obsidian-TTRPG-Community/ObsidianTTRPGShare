special_abilities:
  - name: Cut in with Care (Su)
    desc: If a coryphae successfully claims someone as a dancing partner (see enchanting dance below), any attack made against the coryphae has a 50% chance of targeting its partner until the beginning of its next turn.
  - name: Elegant Maneuvers (Su)
    desc: Whenever a coryphae moves more than 5 feet in a round, it can add its Charisma bonus as a circumstance bonus to its attack rolls and CMB, and as a dodge bonus to its AC. If the coryphae moves 5 feet or less in a round, these bonuses are lost.
  - name: Enchanting Dance (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, a coryphae may move up to its speed while dancing and attempt a combat maneuver check against a single target within 5 feet of any square it passes through. Its movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, but this combat maneuver does not. If the maneuver succeeds, the coryphae claims the target as its dance partner, pulling him along with it. Both creatures gain the grappled condition. An individual coryphae may only claim one dance partner at a time.

 On any round the coryphae succeeds on its combat maneuver check to maintain this grapple, it may move its partner along with it at up to the fey’s normal speed. If this movement would place the partner in a hazardous location, he immediately receives a free attempt to break free with a +4 bonus. At the end of the coryphae’s turn, the claimed partner takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from the frantic dancing and buffeting, and must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. A coryphae never provokes an attack of opportunity from its partner when targeting him with its spell-like abilities, and does not need to succeed at a concentration check to cast a spell-like ability while dancing.

# Description
In the elegant, darkly beautiful courts of the fey, coryphaes entertain and protect their rulers. They live to refine their dances, honing their skills and forever in search of a liege worthy of such boundless dedication and perfection. When faced with enemies or forced onto the battlefield, coryphaes can cleverly use their courtly dancing skills to wreak havoc on the minds and bodies of their bewildered opponents.
