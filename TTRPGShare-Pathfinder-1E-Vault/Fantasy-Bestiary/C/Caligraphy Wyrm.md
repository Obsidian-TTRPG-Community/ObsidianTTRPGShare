  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, a calligraphy wyrm can turn into a golden fountain pen decorated with designs reminiscent of sovereign dragons. The wyrm gains hardness 5 but loses all its senses except hearing and blindsight, and cannot take any actions other than to return to its dragon form as a full-round action. The golden pen counts as a masterwork tool for the purpose of Craft (calligraphy) checks.
  - name: Ink Spray (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action every 2d4 rounds, a calligraphy wyrm can sneeze a 10-foot cone of ink. Creatures must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex save or be covered in ink. Affected creatures are treated as though they had failed a saving throw against glitterdust, except that affected creatures donâ€™t take a penalty on Stealth checks, and can remove the blinded condition automatically as a standard action. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Eons ago, sovereign dragons created calligraphy wyrms to serve as lore-keepers in their mountain lairs. Eventually, these intensely curious creatures spread beyond the domains of their mighty masters. Most of the free calligraphy wyrms settle in large towns or cities, seeking new lore and forms of writing. Because of their natural proclivity for reading and recording information, these creatures often wind up lurking around libraries and colleges, serving wizards, bards, and loremasters as familiars and assistants. 

 Calligraphy wyrms have ink sacs similar to those of squids. In addition to defensive uses, these wyrms use their ink for notation, employing their stylus-shaped claws as writing implements. Most calligraphy wyrms learn to speak several languages, though many creatures find their chirping voices and know-it-all attitudes obnoxious. 

 A 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a calligraphy wyrm as a familiar. A calligraphy wyrm is about 7 inches long and weighs about 1 pound.
