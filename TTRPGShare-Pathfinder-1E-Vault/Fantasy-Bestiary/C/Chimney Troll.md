special_abilities:
  - name: Inhale Flames (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a chimney troll can inhale a single nonmagical fire up to the size of a campfire within 30 feet. This extinguishes the fire and grants the chimney troll regeneration 3 (acid, cold) for 3 rounds. If the fire is attended (such as fire on a held torch), a successful DC 13 Reflex save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Soot Breath (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a chimney troll can exhale a searing cloud of smoke and cinders that fills the lungs of a targeted creature within 30 feet. The victim takes 1d6 points of fire damage and becomes nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A successful DC 13 Fortitude save halves the fire damage taken and negates the nausea effect. This ability can be used once each time the chimney troll inhales flames and only within 3 rounds of using that ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Wicked Blood (Ex)
    desc: Chimney trolls cannot heal hit point damage naturally (such as by resting).

# Description
Chimney trolls are gaunt, pale giants that skulk among the shadowy rooftops of towns and cities, searching for flames to heal their cursed wounds and flesh to sate their bellies. To claim the fire they need to survive, they twist their limbs into impossible positions, hiding in chimneys and sucking up the flames from frightened townsfolk’s hearths.

By some cruel twist of fate or malicious necromancy, chimney trolls’ accursed bodies can heal wounds only if they consume the very substance trolls loathe most: fire. This desperate reliance on fire has made them anathema to their kin, who long ago drove them from their mountain homes and into civilized lands.

Chimney trolls are 9 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds.
