# Description
The crimson jellyfish is a blooddrinking creature whose red color comes from the blood absorbed throughout its body after it feeds. A large fish or sea mammal encountering a pack or bloom of these creatures can be drained of blood in a matter of minutes. Fortunately, a crimson jellyfish’s bright color makes it fairly easy to avoid under well-lit conditions
