special_abilities:
  - name: Hungry Gaze (Su)
    desc: Chemnosit’s gaze attack deals 3d6 points of nonlethal damage plus fatigue at a distance of 120 feet. A successful DC 30 Fortitude save negates the fatigue. Creatures already fatigued become exhausted; creatures already exhausted become staggered. A creature that fails its save must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or gain an overwhelming compulsion to eat flesh of creatures of its type, including its own if no other is available. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    desc: Creatures striking Chemnosit with natural weapons, unarmed strikes, melee weapons, or melee touch attacks take 2d6+12 points of damage.

# Description
The dread burrower Chemnosit is an engine of destruction, able to devour the stoutest construction and the mightiest of mortals with ease. His power lies in the profane glamour of his glowing eye, inspiring a gruesome urge to devour-a hunger for the flesh of one’s own kind. For all his power, this is the true dread of the Monarch Worm. While he burrows constantly through the Darklands to the deepest Vaults of Orv, he sometimes rises to Golarion’s surface bringing annihilation in his wake, as those corrupted by his awful eye wreak devastation upon themselves and their own people. Chemnosit drinks in the carnage like a feast before devouring any survivors.
