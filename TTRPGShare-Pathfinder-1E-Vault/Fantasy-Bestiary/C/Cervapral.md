# Description
Cervaprals embody the essence of liberty and are passionately devoted to both the overthrow of tyranny and the abolition of slavery. They have no moral objection to the concepts of royalty or nobility, but hold any group that is granted authority through inheritance or tradition to a very high standard, insisting that the rights of the ruled must be protected at least as strongly as the rights of the rulers.

Cervaprals frequently serve on the Material Plane as willing allies to servants of good who engage in daring raids to free slaves and unjustly held captives. Cervaprals believe nearly any sacrifice is justified to break the chains of bondage, and are equally at home in frontal assaults as they are in stealthy scout missions and infiltrations. They fervently reject the notion that “the ends justify the means,” and refuse to accept evil acts in the name of promoting greater good. They are willing to give up considerable personal comfort and safety to promote their goals of freedom and independence for all.

If called with the lesser planar ally spell, cervaprals generally demand that payment for their services is donated to a cause that fights slavery and supports freedom. Such a cause must not already be closely allied with the spellcaster or her allies. A cervapral who is called to aid in the immediate and direct liberation of prisoners or slaves often halves the payment he requires for granting such assistance.
