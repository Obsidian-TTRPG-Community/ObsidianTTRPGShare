    desc: As a standard action, a cynosoma can hurl a cloud of sleep-inducing dust at a creature within 30 feet. That creature must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or immediately fall asleep (as per deep slumber, but with no HD limit). This is a mind-affecting sleep effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Stardust (Ex)
    desc: The shimmering dust that hangs around a cynosoma’s body helps defend her from peril, granting her a +6 deflection bonus to AC. Once per day as a swift action, a cynosoma can cause her stardust to coalesce, granting her concealment for 1d4 rounds.

# Description
Cynosomas, sometimes called “moth angels” or “daughters of Desna”, are a race of outsiders native to the demiplane of Cynosure. They often depart their home to wander the vastness of the Material Plane, and do so with Desna’s blessing; the goddess encourages her children to choose their own path, even when it leads away from her service.

 Cynosomas rarely seek battle, but neither do they shy away from it, especially when innocents are threatened or when they encounter foes of their faith. In combat, a cynosoma fights with spell and starknife, using her mobility and glitterdust spell-like ability to allow for sneak attacks. Cynosomas are protectors of all who sleep, though, and no cynosoma ever willingly allows sleeping creatures-even hated enemies-to be harmed.

 A cynosoma stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 120 pounds.
