special_abilities:
  - name: Anesthetizing Injection (Ex)
    desc: A clockwork vivisectionist that has pinned a victim can try to anesthetize the victim with fluid-filled syringes normally stored in the vivisectionist’s chest compartment. The vivisectionist performs the injection as a standard action. This deals no damage, but the victim must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 minutes. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Efficient Winding (Ex)
    desc: A clockwork vivisectionist can function for 2 days per Hit Die every time it is wound.
  - name: Standby (Ex)
    desc: A clockwork vivisectionist can place itself on standby as a standard action. While on standby, a clockwork vivisectionist cannot move or take any actions, but it remains aware of its surroundings. Time spent on standby does not count against the vivisectionist’s wind-down duration. A clockwork vivisectionist can exit standby as a swift action.

desc_short: The mechanical workings of this humanoid figure are incredibly complex, but the gore-spattered scalpels it has on one hand and the glistening syringes inside its cage-like chest make its intentions clear.

# Description
Assembled by unknown creators for inscrutable purposes, clockwork vivisectionists wait in the depths of ageless dungeons or within the tombs of forgotten kings. When wound, they pursue a single purpose: to examine the inner workings of living humanoids. They approach this task with a cold, insatiable curiosity that has somehow been programmed into their clicking levers and complex gear trains. Clockwork vivisectionists enter combat only to paralyze victims for later vivisection.
