# Description
Most catfolk are tribal hunter-gatherers who dwell in harmony with nature, though some tribes have acclimated well to urban environments. As a culture, catfolk are loyal, generous, and amiable. They like belonging to and being at harmony with a group whose members work together to accomplish their needs and wants. Tribal catfolk prefer for the most capable societal members to lead, so every tribe has a council of elevated subchiefs. A tribe’s chief is usually the most competent (and magically talented) member of that tribe.

Personal growth is part of catfolk culture, as is expression as a means of personal exploration. Catfolk have few taboos, and often exhibit harmless but strange eccentricities. Individuals cultivate a wide range of pursuits and self-expression, taking risks others might label unwise. Most individual catfolk like to be the center of attention, but not at the cost of group cohesion.
