# Description
Chalicotheriums are massive creatures resembling sloths with vaguely equine heads and long forelimbs ending in wickedly sharp claws. While the size and the claws of these creatures make them seem fierce, they are generally docile animals and become aggressive only in the defense of their homes and offspring. They typically f ight only until the invaders have f led, but if their young are threatened, they will not relent until the attacker is dead, even if they must pursue it for a great distance to be sure.

 These herbivorous creatures are generally found alone or in pairs, along with any of their young.

 A typical adult chalicotherium is about 10 feet tall at the shoulder and 12 feet long from nose to rump, and weighs 14,000 pounds.
