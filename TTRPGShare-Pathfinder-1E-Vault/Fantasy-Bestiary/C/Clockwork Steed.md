# Description
These tireless constructs were designed by engineers as a replacement for normal horses. They can gallop ceaselessly for hours or even days if required. In addition to their endurance, clockwork steeds pack a powerful physical punch-blows from their hooves can send smaller creatures flying. Though many riders enjoy the unquestioning way that clockwork steeds accept commands from their riders, others find these steedsâ€™ lack of personality frustrating. Unlike normal horses, a clockwork steed lacks the ability to create a bond with its rider.
