    desc: Three times per day, a centianima can shake its body as a full-round action to shoot deadly bone shards at all creatures within a 15-foot radius. These bone shards deal 2d6 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 14 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Dual Threat (Ex)
    desc: A centianima has a head at each end of its long body, and each head has a bite attack. Each head can make only one bite attack per round. A centianima still counts as a single creature for effects that would target it.

# Description
Horrifying amalgams driven by an insatiable desire to kill living things and collect their bones, centianimas exemplify the ravenous, ugly evil of the undead. These animalistic collections of bones typically form from the remains of numerous animals that died in terrible agony. The dark forces and suffering that animates these remains typically cause these horrors to form in ominous, multilimbed shapes vaguely reminiscent of macabre centipedes. Although they look merely like heaps of bones when at rest, they can hardly be mistaken as such when on the move. Centianimas are possessed of a dark, predatory cunning that makes them particularly efficient hunters.

A centianima measures 12 feet long and weighs approximately 400 pounds.
