    desc: As a full-round action, a coffin anemone can affix itself to a solid surface. While anchored, it cannot move and gains a +4 bonus to its CMD against bull rush, drag, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers. This bonus increases by 4 for each size category larger the sea anemone is compared to the opponent. It can unanchor as a full-round action.
