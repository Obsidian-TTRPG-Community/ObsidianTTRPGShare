special_abilities:
  - name: Collapse (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a cutlass spider can fall into a heap of blades and parts. Any creature occupying a square adjacent to a cutlass spider when it collapses must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or take 2d6+5 points of slashing and piercing damage. While collapsed, a cutlass spider is considered prone and can take no action other than to reform itself as a standard action. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Shared Enhancement (Su)
    desc: Should a cutlass spider have a magical weapon incorporated into its body (either given to it by its creator or stolen via its weapon thief ability), it applies the weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus and special abilities to all of its natural attacks. The construct benefits from the abilities of only the highest-value magical weapon incorporated into its body. For example, a cutlass spider that incorporates a +1 flaming short sword gains a +1 enhancement bonus and the effects of the flaming special ability on its claw and bite attacks. Should it later acquire a +3 holy quarterstaff, the effects of the short sword are replaced, and its claws and bite gain a +3 enhancement bonus and the holy special ability.
  - name: Weapon Thief (Ex)
    desc: A cutlass spider that disarms an opponent incorporates the disarmed weapon into its body. The weapon cannot be retrieved until the cutlass spider is destroyed.
