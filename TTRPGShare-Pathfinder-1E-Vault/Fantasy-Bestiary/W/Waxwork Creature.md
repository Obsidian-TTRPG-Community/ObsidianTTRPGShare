# Description
The practice of making sculptures from wax dates back to the earliest humanoid civilizations. Only the medium of wax can so closely duplicate the transparency of skin. Often, creators use powerful magic to house an animating spirit within the wax model. A created waxwork creature obeys the commands of its creator. Rarely, a wax sculpture animates of it own accord-the result of nearby magic suffusing the wax or a lost spirit in search of a corporeal form. Such waxwork creatures are uncontrolled.

 A waxwork creature is the same size as the creature it duplicates, but weighs only half as much.
