# Description
This relative of the common vulture is most often found in the region of Whisperfall Pass. Unlike its scavenging cousin, the Whisperfall vulture is a hunter, taking down rabbits and other small game with ease thanks to its speed and surprising agility. Hungry flocks of these birds of prey can even take down a human adult by sheer force of numbers.

 Whisperfall vulture eggs are a delicacy, and those who can find and claim them can make a good amount of money selling them to merchants in Urgir.

 A mature Whisperfall vulture has an 8-foot-long wingspan and weighs 50 pounds.
