special_abilities:
  - name: Infuse Arrow (Su)
    desc: A wild hunt archer can cast a single spell-like ability with the range of touch as a part of a full attack. If he does so, the spell infuses his bow and travels with the next arrow he fires. If he hits a creature with that arrow, the target is also subject to the effects of the spell. If he misses, the spell vanishes from the arrow. Alternatively, he can infuse his bow with a spell-like ability that affects an area as a standard action. The spell’s area of effect centers around wherever the arrow lands. If he hits a creature with such an arrow, that creature takes a -4 penalty on saves and checks it attempts against the effects of the spell, and also to its CMD against the spell effects (if applicable).
  - name: Living Bow (Su)
    desc: Any non-magical bow that a wild hunt archer picks up gains a spark of life, sprouting small leaves and becoming a +5 icy burst seeking composite longbow for as long as the archer holds it. The archer’s quiver produces arrows automatically as the archer draws them; these arrows vanish after 1 round.
  - name: Wild Hunt Link (Su)
    desc: The weapon attacks and natural attacks of all creatures in a wild hunt archer’s wild hunt link ignore miss chances from concealment, as long as they target the correct square.

# Description
Wild hunt archers are methodical hunters who fire their bows with uncanny accuracy. Since wild hunt archers tend to be slower on foot than most of their companions, they will often rely on wild hunt horses to provide increased mobility. Rather than carrying normal arrows, they can produce arrows from magical quivers-these quivers do not function in this manner for anyone other than wild hunt archers. Rarely, they carry specific slaying arrows to augment particularly dangerous hunts.
