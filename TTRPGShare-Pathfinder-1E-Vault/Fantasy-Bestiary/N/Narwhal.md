# Description
The narwhal is a skilled hunter in arctic waters, and has been known to dive deeper than even much larger cetaceans both in open water and beneath thick sheets of waterborne ice. Male narwhals possess a single, 6-footlong tusk extending from just above the mouth that serves to impress females during mating season, though in times of need the tusks may be used to break through thick ice or even in self-defense. A typical narwhal is 14 feet long (not including the tusk) and weighs 3,200 pounds.
