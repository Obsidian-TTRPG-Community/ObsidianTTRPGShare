# Description
commune spell.

A saint is the embodiment of the crusader ideal. A saint might head a crusader temple or order or could be matriarch of her own religious tradition. A saint usually keeps a priest and holy warrior as advisors (CR 12), or a saint with a squad of four holy warriors might accompany a king (CR 15).
