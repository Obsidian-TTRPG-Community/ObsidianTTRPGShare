tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The monk drinks his potions of mage armor and bear’s endurance and tries to find a choke point where he can stand fast and hold off his enemies.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: If he can control an opening such as a doorway, the monk does his best not to move or let others past. He uses Vital Strike whenever he cannot use flurry of blows. He uses Improved Bull Rush on any opponent that has failed its saving throw versus Scorpion Style, trying to remove it from direct combat. He trips those adjacent to him so he can make attacks of opportunity when they stand up from prone. Against a single opponent, the steadfast defender uses his ki pool to add extra attacks to his flurry of blows; against multiple opponents he uses it to improve his Armor Class.
  - name: Base Statistics
    desc: When not under the effects of bear’s endurance and mage armor, the monk’s statistics are AC 19, touch 18, flat-footed 18; hp 75; Fort +10; Con 16.
