# Description
Some good-hearted Varisians try to forget that the Sczarni exist. They tire of the shame with which that small branch of their ethnicity has tainted outsiders’ perceptions of them. Unfortunately, the Sczarni are all over Varisia and are here to stay. If you ask the Sczarni, they’ll tell you Varisia is their land and it always has been.

The Sczarni often prey on those foreign to their lands who set up citystates throughout the countryside, but they also rip off and burglarize other Varisians. While some Varisians struggle against the newcomers staking their claims to the Varisian frontier, the Sczarni recognize that they collect more gold these days by ripping off these settlers than they did when they were just bandits and swindlers preying on their own. The Sczarni have all kinds of rackets running, from cutpurses to con artists’ scams to outright banditry, but it’s Sczarni thieves who prof it the most from foreigners. This Sczarni thief represents a typical burglar, pickpocket, or second-story operator, while the Sczarni thug presented in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments represents a common thug or low-level leg-breaker. Sczarni thieves operate most often in the various cities and towns of Varisia.

Depending on how they are approached or encountered, Sczarni thieves can be allies in a heist or cagey opponents in a game of cat and mouse. Many different gangs operate throughout Varisia, so Sczarni thieves working with the Tower Girls might be slightly different from the drugdealing Creepers infesting Underbridge. Sczarni thieves break into homes and warehouses, pilfer important items from aristocrats and adventurers alike, and generally operate in the shadows of the Sczarni-and the citizenry as a whole. Sczarni thieves come from many different walks of life. Some are born into Sczarni families, but others grow up in wealthy merchant households and succumb to the urge to pull off complicated burglary schemes. Varisians who join Sczarni families later in life are more closely scrutinized by their superiors than other Sczarni thieves.

In recent years, a Sczarni family in Absalom has formed a growing alliance with the Pathfinder Society, under the guidance of the unscrupulous smuggler and blackmailer Guaril Karela (CN human male rogue 11). The Sczarni use the Pathfinders’ good name throughout the Inner Sea region to gain access to people, places, and information that would otherwise be inaccessible to them, while the Pathfinders appreciate the Sczarni’s knack for getting contraband into and out of hostile areas. Many a field agent has been extracted from danger in the back of a Sczarni caravan wagon, and just as many Sczarni have tagged along with Pathfinders in order to enter a city where their kind would normally be unwelcome.
