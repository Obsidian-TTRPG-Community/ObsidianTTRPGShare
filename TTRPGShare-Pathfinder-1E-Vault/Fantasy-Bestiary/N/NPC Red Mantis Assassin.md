# Description
The assassins in the mysterious order known as the Red Mantis stand at the pinnacle of their craft. Dedicated to the god Achaekek, Red Mantis assassins conduct their business with the fervor and zealotry of religious fanatics. Though their organization is headquartered on Mediogalti Island, Red Mantis assassins are feared throughout the Inner Sea region. Once the order has accepted a contract on a target, the assassins relent only once the victim is dead-in a most permanent fashion.
