# Description
Prostitutes are workers for hire in the field of love. From cheap trollops to brazen strumpets, saucy tarts to haughty courtesans, they work the streets and backroom brothels of cities and towns, tending to the wants, needs, and dark desires of their clients, often in elaborate costume and makeup for erotic roleplay. Most prostitutes have at least a little larceny in their hearts, however, and those who procure their services would be well advised to keep a close eye on their purses.

Prostitutes could be used as members of a harem or an actors’ troupe. A prostitute might also be a noble’s or wealthy businessman’s mistress, or even a barmaid looking to make a little money on the side. Prostitutes also make good low-level spies or undercover agents.

A dealer might serve as pimp for a group of four prostitutes (CR 6), or eight prostitutes might be performers in a minstrel’s show (CR 8). A harem of six prostitutes is usually guarded by a eunuch slaver (CR 7). A barkeep might have a prostitute on his staff, along with two barmaids (CR 5), or a prostitute may be found in the company of a pair of noble scions (CR 5).
