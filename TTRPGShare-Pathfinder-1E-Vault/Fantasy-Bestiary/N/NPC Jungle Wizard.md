# Description
Jungle wizards live in harmony with nature. They’re frequently mistaken for druids, and often use such misunderstandings to their advantage. Many jungle wizards use natural materials for their magical gear, such as large leaves or hides for spellbooks and scrolls, unworked tree branches for wands, or grasses that can be knotted into the shapes of rings.
