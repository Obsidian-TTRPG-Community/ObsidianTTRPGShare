tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The monk uses Stealth to find a hiding spot in an effort to gain the element of surprise.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The monk uses Deflect Arrows to close in on ranged combatants. He uses Lunge to keep enemies at bay and flurry of blows to trip multiple opponents if surrounded, allowing him the full benefit of his Combat Reflexes when tripped opponents try to stand. A swift brawler uses Power Attack against enemies he has tripped or stunned, only risking the penalty on his attack rolls when his target’s AC has been compromised in some way.
