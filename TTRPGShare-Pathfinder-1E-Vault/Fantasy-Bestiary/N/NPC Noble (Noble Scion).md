# Description
Noble scions are the haughty and proud offspring of aristocratic sires, full of the fresh vigor of youth and all the hauteur of those born in a manor. They have received fine education and know a modicum of social graces, but typically practice them only when other highborn are present. Noble scions are scornful of commoners and vagabonds, who return the sentiment toward these peacocks strutting in their finery.

If used as minor court functionaries and sycophants, noble scions can be sources of palace gossip and intrigue. They can also be used as experienced squires who have not yet risen to the knighthood, or as aristocratic cavalry.

A noble scion might be appointed to lead a lance of cavarly (CR 9). A pair of noble scions might dog the footsteps of a princess (CR 7), three noble scions could make up a knight’s entourage (CR 8), or eight noble scions can form a gang of rakes with a noble (CR 10).
