    desc: As a standard action, a nucol can bellow out a contagious cough. This cough can take one of two forms: a ranged touch attack consisting of a wad of infectious phlegm with a range of 30 feet, or a spray of snot and spit that can affect creatures in a 15-foot cone. Creatures subject to the cone effect can avoid the effects of the cough with a successful DC 15 Reflex save.

As long as a creature suffering from this illness suffers any Wisdom damage from any source, it takes a -1 penalty to its Armor Class and on ability checks and skill checks. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Nucols are sahkils that delight in spreading the fear of parasites and other unseen things that can pollute the body and cause sickness. They spread a disease that weakens their victims’ will and amplifies feelings of doubt and inadequacy. Nucols often use their remove disease spell-like ability to bargain with their victims, agreeing to cure them in return for a favor. The sahkil legitimately heals the victim of its affliction, but the price for doing so often outweighs the value of the curative.

 A nucol is over 4 feet long and weighs 90 pounds.
