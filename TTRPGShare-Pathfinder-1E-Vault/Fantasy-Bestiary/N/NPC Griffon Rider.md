tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: Well in advance of battle, the fighter activates her bronze griffon and saddles and armors it. Before the fighting starts, she mounts her griffon, takes to the air, and quaffs her potion of heroism.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The fighter flies above the battlefield taking passes with her lance, never flying lower than 10 feet above the ground. If outmatched in melee, she retreats to higher altitude and uses her bow. A griffon rider loves to unseat other mounted combatants, particularly if they’re flying. She keeps a plentiful supply of alchemist’s fire in case any flammable targets present themselves.
