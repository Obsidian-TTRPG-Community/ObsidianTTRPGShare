tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The monk prefers to challenge foes openly. He spends a point from his ki pool to increase his speed.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The monk uses Great Cleave and Lunge in tandem, normally spending a point from his ki pool to offset the Armor Class penalty of these two feats. The monk makes unarmed strikes, attempting to stun or stagger with Stunning Fist and then use Improved Bull Rush to push the enemy away. If overwhelmed, the monk drinks a potion of mirror image to confuse attackers, uses Spring Attack or Great Cleave to attack multiple opponents as a standard action, then moves away quickly. The monk always leaves 2 points in his ki pool so he can use abundant step if he’s severely threatened.

# Description
Some elven monks master the art of carnage with one chosen weapon. Sword savants are particularly adept at keeping their foes at a distance until it’s time to land the killing blow.
