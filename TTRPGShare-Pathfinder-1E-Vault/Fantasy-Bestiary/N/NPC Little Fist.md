tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The monk often tries to reason or treat with potential foes in an effort to avoid unnecessary combat, or to quietly study enemies and discern each one’s strengths and weaknesses. Once combat is unavoidable, he drinks potions of barkskin and bull’s strength.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The monk trusts his improved evasion, high saves, and spell resistance to safeguard him against spellcasters, and focuses on martial opponents, combining Spring Attack and Stunning Fist. He uses Lunge against Small or Medium opponents, often using ki points to grant himself a bonus to AC and negate the penalty from using Lunge. When making a flurry of blows, he attempts a Stunning Fist on the first strike. He uses Snatch Arrows to return thrown weapons and Deadly Aim whenever he catches a weapon he is proficient with.
