# Description
A nikaramsa exploits the hubris and awe of mortal priests by disguising itself as a deity’s chosen messenger and granting divine boons to a congregation, confusing believers by imparting more and more heretical lessons as gospel truths. The nikaramsa then corrupts the faith’s blessings, causing the religion to collapse in the wake of its own clergy’s atrocities.
