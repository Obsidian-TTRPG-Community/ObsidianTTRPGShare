tactics:
  - name: Before Combat
    desc: The barbarian uses her wand of shield before most battles, but also uses her wand of mirror image if she expects a difficult fight or a battle against a strong lone enemy.
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The barbarian closes quickly to make full attacks with her hooked hammer, using the thundering pick end as her primary weapon and the hammer as her off-hand attack. If she has to charge or otherwise move between attacks, she makes a single two-handed Power Attack with the pick end. She uses moment of clarity to trigger a wand or scroll if the situation demands, such as in an encounter with a flying or invisible foe. She prefers to reserve her boots of speed for when she is already in melee, to facilitate full attacks or to close the distance on faster enemies.
