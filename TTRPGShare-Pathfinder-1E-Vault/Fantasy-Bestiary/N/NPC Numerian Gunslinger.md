special_abilities:
  - name: Laser Pistol (Ex)
    desc: The gunslinger’s laser pistol is a one-handed firearm that shoots a beam of highly focused light at its target, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage on a successful hit. The gun has a range increment of 50 feet, and its attacks resolve against the target’s touch AC. Lasers can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Each shot expends 1 charge of the gun’s 10-charge capacity. As a semiautomatic weapon, the gun fires one shot per attack. If the gunslinger wishes, he can fire an additional shot per round as if using the Rapid Shot feat. This additional shot can stack with the additional shot granted by Rapid Shot, but when it does so, it increases the penalty for all shots fired that round to -6. A laser pistol is worth 10,000 gp and weighs 2 pounds.
  - name: Numerian Silverdisks (Ex)
    desc: These small, coin-sized discs are etched with circuitry, and contain 10 charges each. When placed in a special slot in the gunslinger’s laser pistol, a silverdisk transfers its charge into the gun’s internal capacitors, effectively reloading the weapon. A silverdisk can be recharged (with a 20% chance of being destroyed) with an active generator. A charged silverdisk glows with light equivalent to that of a candle. A Numerian silverdisk is worth 100 gp as long as it is capable of holding a charge; a dead silverdisk is worth 1 gp.
  - name: Rare Resources (Ex)
    desc: The Numerian gunslinger’s access to the rare and expensive technology of the land’s many metal ruins increases his wealth to that of a PC of her level. This increases his CR by 1.

# Description
Not content with the black powder guns of Alkenstar, the Numerian gunslinger tracks down and masters the high-tech weaponry of Numeria. In the course of his travels, he’s made enemies among the Technic League, who, like the people of Alkenstar, want to ensure that their advanced technology doesn’t spread beyond their reach. Other technological firearms can be found in Numeria beyond the laser pistol-see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide for more examples of advanced firearms such a character could use.
