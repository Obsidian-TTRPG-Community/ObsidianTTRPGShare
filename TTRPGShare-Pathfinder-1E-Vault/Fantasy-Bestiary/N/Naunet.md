special_abilities:
  - name: Adaptive Strike (Su)
    desc: A naunet’s natural weapons count as magical and chaotic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. As a free action once per round, a naunet may infuse all of its natural attacks with adamantine, silver, or cold iron, thereby allowing it to overcome damage reduction of those types as well.
  - name: Coalesce Chaos (Su)
    desc: Once per day as a standard action, three or more naunets working together can create a roiling cloud of multicolored chaos matter. This effect is identical to solid fog (CL 12th) and lasts for 2d6 rounds. If six or more naunets are present, the coalesced chaos instead functions as acid fog (CL 12th).
  - name: Confusion (Su)
    desc: A creature struck by a naunet’s tentacle attack is infused with raw chaos, and must make a DC 19 Will save or be confused for 1 round. Rounds of confusion dealt in this manner stack. A creature with a chaotic component to its alignment gains a +4 bonus on saves against this effect, and creatures with the chaotic subtype are immune. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Far more bestial than their kin, naunets are the lowest caste of the true proteans, the shock troops of their race and roving marauders in the cause of chaos. Primarily found in the shifting borderlands between Limbo and other planes, naunets are driven half-insane by the stability and stasis of such areas, and frequently rampage through the edges of other planes, tearing up the very fabric of reality itself and returning vast swaths of land to the beautiful, formless potentiality of their home.

A naunet is 12 feet long and weighs 900 pounds.
