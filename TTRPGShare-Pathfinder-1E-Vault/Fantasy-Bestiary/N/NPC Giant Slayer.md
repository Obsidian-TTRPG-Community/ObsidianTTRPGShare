tactics:
  - name: During Combat
    desc: The barbarian switches from a one-handed to a two-handed grip on his axe as the situation demands. He uses his shield against multiple foes but keeps his bow in hand if in melee against a lone enemy. He uses his rolling dodge before exposing himself to missiles, especially giant-hurled boulders, and assumes his guarded stance in melee. He charges with Spring Attack to get close to his enemies, following it up with full attacks.
