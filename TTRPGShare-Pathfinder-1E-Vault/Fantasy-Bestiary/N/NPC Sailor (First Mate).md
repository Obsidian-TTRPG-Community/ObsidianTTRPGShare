# Description
A first mate is the loyal assistant to a shipâ€™s captain. He oversees duties and discipline aboard ship, feared but always respected; he is able to entertain with a sea shanty one moment and ply his trusty lash or flashing cutlasses the next. A first mate could also be the warden of an exotic island prison. Away from their ships, first mates can be found with a traveling merchant quartermaster (CR 9), or a captain (CR 12).
