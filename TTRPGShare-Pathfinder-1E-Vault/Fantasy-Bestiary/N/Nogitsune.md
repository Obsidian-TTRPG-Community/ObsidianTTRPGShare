special_abilities:
  - name: Contagious Whisper (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a nogitsune can influence a target she speaks to as per the spell suggestion. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be affected by this effect. In addition to being subject to suggestion’s normal effects, any creature affected by the contagious whisper can pass the enchantment on to other targets. Doing so requires the target to communicate the nogitsune’s suggestion, forcing the new target to save as if it were the initial target. If such a secondary target resists the contagious whisper, it is unaffected, but this does not remove the suggestion from the initial target. Failing the save puts another creature under the nogitsune’s compulsion. Newly affected creatures are also able to spread the suggestion. A nogitsune’s compelling whisper can affect a number of creatures equal to the its Hit Dice and lasts for a number of hours equal to its Hit Dice. Creatures that successfully save versus the nogitsune’s compelling whisper (as a primary or secondary target) cannot be affected by that particular nogitsune’s compelling whisper for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    desc: A nogitsune can make a Bluff check or use its obscuring mist spell-like ability as a swift action in any round in which it moves up to half its base land speed.

# Description
Nogitsune are created when oni spirits take over the bodies of kitsune (sagacious humanoid fox-creatures). The resultant possession creates a creature with the kitsune’s foxlike grace and cunning and infuses it with the destructive power of an oni (Note from Nethys: This bolded information is not entirely correct and has been further clarified here). Nogitsune are always female, and resemble shapely humans with a covering of fur and a fox’s head. A nogitsune’s fur color varies and can be orange and white, grey, pure white, or even black. Whenever nogitsune use their shapechanging abilities to assume a humanoid form, they still evince somewhat pointed, vulpine features. In addition, any hair on their assumed form betrays the natural coloration of their pelts. Nogitsune stand between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds.

More details on kitsune can be found in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Dragon Empires Gazetteer.
