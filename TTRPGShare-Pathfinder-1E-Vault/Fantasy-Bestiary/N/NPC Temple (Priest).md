# Description
A priest is a leader within his church, spreading the faith by any means necessary, even through conversion at swordpoint when argument fails. A priest can be a crusader, warpriest, or divine champion. A priest might be advisor to a noble (CR 10), or travel with a retinue of a dozen temple guards (CR 10).
