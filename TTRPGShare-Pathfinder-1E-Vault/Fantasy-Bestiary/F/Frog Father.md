# Description
Frog fathers devour entire hives of monstrous vermin and any livestock that stray too close to their marshes, but happily gulp down any prey that crosses their paths. Their long, sticky tongues allow them to capture and restrain prey while they determine whether they want to consume it. A frog father’s chosen prey has little chance of escaping, as the frog’s powerful throat muscles allow it to swallow even large creatures rapidly.
