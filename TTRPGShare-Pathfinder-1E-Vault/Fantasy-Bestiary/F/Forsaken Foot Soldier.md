    desc: When destroyed, a forsaken foot soldier leaves behind a ghostly green apparition that stands in the same square in which it was destroyed for 24 hours. The apparition doesn’t hinder movement through the square and cannot take actions, but the allies of the destroyed forsaken foot soldier treat the apparition as an ally for the purpose of flanking and using teamwork feats. If the forsaken foot soldier is destroyed with positive energy or holy water, this apparition does not appear.

# Description
The greatest strength of the rank-and-file soldiers of the Jistka Imperium was their ability to work as a cohesive unit in stressful situations. Now powered by unholy energies, these legionnaires’ loyalty transcends even death. Wherever groupings of forsaken legionnaires are found, there is always a solid number of foot soldiers, which still serve as the elite backbone of Jistkan companies even though they have long been forgotten.
