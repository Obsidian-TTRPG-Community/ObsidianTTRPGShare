# Description
Fastachees are mysterious, wise, and generous fey who foster the growth of nearby plants. Many communities who interact with them revere them as bringers of food and medicine, as well as protectors of crops. These fey have a particularly strong connection to corn; they regularly project their senses through corn plants to monitor the health of the field and search the local area for threats. They prefer to avoid direct confrontation if possible, using their ability to originate their spells from corn plants to harass those they wish to chase away.
