special_abilities:
  - name: Lignification (Su)
    desc: A creature struck by a forest blight's claw must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain as its flesh transforms into increasingly immobile wood and plant matter. A creature whose Dexterity score is reduced to 0 by this ability is permanently turned into an ordinary tree. This effect ends (but does not restore drained Dexterity) if removed via a spell like break enchantment or remove curse, or if the forest blight is slain. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Living Forest (Su)
    desc: Non-creature plants within a forest blight's cursed domain twist to clutch at intruders. All creatures treat a forest blight's cursed domain as difficult terrain as a result. Any creature trying to manipulate, control, or interact with the plants of this domain (including those using spells like command plants, entangle, and transport via plants) must succeed at a DC 25 caster level check or the attempt fails. The forest blight ignores these penalties, and as a free action can designate other creatures that can also ignore these penalties. All plant creatures in a forest blight's cursed domain gain fast healing 5; plant creatures that already have fast healing increase their fast healing rate by 5.

# Description
Forest blights’ constant urges to seek out and destroy civilization drive them toward isolated lumber camps, wilderness trade routes, and forest settlements. Forest blights are particularly fond of sending plant monsters to do their bidding, and their innate cruelty often compels them to allow one or two survivors to escape their clutches to act as a lure, drawing perspective heroes to attempt foolish acts of retribution against the powerful and egotistical oozes. Forest blights are always eager to add new would-be saviors to their collections of transformed trees, after all. 

A forest blight is 7 feet across and weighs 350 pounds.
