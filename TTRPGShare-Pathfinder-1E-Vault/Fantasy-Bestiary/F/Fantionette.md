special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Revelation (Su)
    desc: A fantionette appears as an adult halfling or a human child (its choice) to all creatures outside of its aura. This is an illusion (glamer) effect that can be bypassed only by true seeing or similar magic. A creature within a fantionette's aura that is studying or interacting with it can attempt a DC 15 Will save to perceive the outsider for what it truly is. A creature that succeeds at this save or that is attacked by a fantionette immediately sees the fantionette's true form for the next 24 hours, even while outside the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Puppet Strings (Su)
    desc: Once per day as an immediate action, a fantionette can relinquish control of itself, letting a higher entity (presumably Thamir Gixx) gain control. When it does this, a fantionette can perform one of the following special actions. Make an extra attack as part of a standard action. Move up to its speed. The fantionette loses its move action on its next turn. Reroll a single roll after it was made, but before the results are determined.

# Description
A fantionette is a servitor outsider for the halfling deity Thamir Gixx. It embodies the halfling godâ€™s association with assassination and opportunity, presenting itself to loyal followers of the Silent Blade both as a powerful assassin and as impressive support for established murderers. When left to its own devices on the Material Plane, a fantionette is a terrifying stalker of halflings and humans alike, positioning itself among large groups of human children or halflings and selecting adult targets to murder based entirely on whim and opportunity.

 A fantionette stands between 3 and 4 feet high and weighs about 70 pounds.
