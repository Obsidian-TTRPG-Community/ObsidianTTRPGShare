# Description
Organization solitary or gang (2-4)
Treasure noneSpecial AbilitiesImmunity to Magic (Su) A fossil golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell slows a fossil golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.A stone to flesh spell negates its damage reduction and petrification ability for 1 round. Petrification (Su) The attacks of a fossil golem gradually turn living flesh to stone. Each time the golem hits a target with one of its natural attacks, the target must make a DC 19  Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by this attack turns completely to stone, as if by a flesh to stone spell. Casting stone to flesh on the creature removes all Dexterity drain caused by this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.DescriptionA fossil golem is constructed of the stony bones of long-dead dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. These bones are generally not assembled with any attempt to accurately model the original creature-usually, the skulls of powerful predatory dinosaurs (such as tyrannosauruses) serve in the place of hands, granting the fossil golem a pair of devastating bite attacks. The magical energies that infuse a fossil golem create an additional peril-they transform fossilization into a terrible form of contagion that can affect any creature they damage.

Fossil golems are often used to guard caverns and other natural fortifications. A fossil golem at rest might look to the untrained eye like nothing more than a strange display of bones. A fossil golem is 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.
