# Description
Fire giant kings rule over their volcanic dominions with a cruel and heavy hand. Most kings seek the hand of a queen to reign beside them, both to secure their own power and to provide heirs to accede to their thrones when they inevitably fall in battle. A fire giant king must always watch his back, however, for there are always claimants eager to seize his position.
