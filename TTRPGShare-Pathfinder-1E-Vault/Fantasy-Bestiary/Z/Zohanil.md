special_abilities:
  - name: Addiction (Ex)
    desc: When a zohanil damages a creature with its talons, it injects the target with a severely addictive fluid that blurs vision and deadens reflexes. A creature can resist the effects of this injected toxin with a successful DC 22 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim takes a -2 penalty to all Wisdom- and Dexterity-based checks for 1 hour. After this hour passes, the penalty fades but the victim suffers the effects of withdrawal, taking a -2 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom. These ability score penalties are negated on any round the victim takes the Wisdom- and Dexterity-based check penalty from further addiction attacks from the zohanil, but are otherwise permanent (as per a severe addiction; see page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide for details). This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Look of Fear (Su)
    desc: A creature affected by a zohanilâ€™s gaze is panicked for 1 round and shaken for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is instead shaken for 1 round.

# Description
Zohanils delight in haunting those who fear needles and invasive medical procedures. They also enjoy sowing addiction in hopes of heightening despair. A zohanil stands over 6 feet tall and weighs roughly 200 pounds.
