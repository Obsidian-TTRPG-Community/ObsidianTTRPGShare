# Description
Zombie lords are the fleshy counterparts of skeletal champions-intelligent, cunning, and envious of creatures whose bodies aren’t rotting away. Despite their decaying flesh, they are not slow like common zombies, and can easily pursue fleeing prey. Zombie lords are more powerful than common zombies and retain their class levels.
