special_abilities:
  - name: Idolatry (Su)
    desc: When a vilsteth uses enter image, meld into stone, possess object, or statue to assume the appearance of a public or religious monument (either by entering or controlling an existing object or by taking the semblance of one), it can make itself an object of worship and adoration. This functions as sympathy (DC 25, CL 18th) upon either a single creature within 30 feet or all creatures of the chosen type or alignment within 30 feet. Any creature that fails its saving throw against this effect must attempt an additional DC 25 Will save after spending 24 hours within 30 feet of the object of worship. If the targeted creature fails this second save, it’s affected as if under a permanent mind fog effect with respect to the vilsteth. This is a curse effect and cannot be dispelled (although dispel chaos or dispel evil can remove this effect, as does break enchantment).
  - name: Labyrinthine Mindtrap (Su)
    desc: Whenever a vilsteth is targeted with a divination or mind-affecting effect, including effects that simply facilitate mental communication, the caster’s mind is entrapped within the twisted corridors and pathways of the vilsteth’s intellect, causing the caster to become dazed (Will DC 25 negates). Each round on the victim’s turn, it can attempt a new saving throw to escape this mind trap, ending its turn, but each failed save deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain to the creature. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same vilsteth’s labyrinthine mindtrap for 24 hours.
  - name: Mindrender (Su)
    desc: When a vilsteth hits with both claw attacks and rends its target, it gains a +4 profane bonus on its gore attack for that turn. In addition, if the vilsteth’s gore attack hits, the target is affected by the vilsteth’s labyrinthine mindtrap ability, even if the targeted creature already successfully saved against that ability in the last 24 hours.
  - name: Unspeakable Truth (Su)
    desc: A vilsteth is surrounded by a mantle of misinformation. Creatures within 30 feet are affected by a curse that manifests the next time they attempt to share information about the vilsteth, including things they have observed the demon saying or doing. This curse affects the creature as fumbletongueUM (Will DC 25 negates). A successful save negates the curse, but if the target fails the save, this curse manifests every time that target attempts to talk about the vilsteth. This curse is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and can’t be dispelled or suppressed with protection from evil. A vilsteth can order creatures affected by charm or compulsion effects that it creates to share information about it without triggering the curse.

# Description
Vilsteth demons, also known as corruption demons, are calved from the essence of the demon lord Baphomet’s realm of the Ivory Labyrinth. Vilsteths form from the souls of corrupt and deceitful politicians, priests, and power brokers-those who in life abused and misused whatever ephemeral power they wielded. The defining sin of these souls was pride, fueled by vanity and a desire for adulation and ever-greater authority to be wielded in whatever selfish way they saw fit, coupled with a furious envy of anyone more beloved, respected, or feared than they. Vilsteths epitomize these traits, and can often be found lurking in monuments dedicated to important political figures or disguised within statues of prominent saints and heroes. In their natural form, vilsteths are over 7 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds.
