  - name: Gibber (Su)
    desc: Vescavors yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor swarm or inside it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same vescavor swarm’s gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Ravenous (Ex)
    desc: Vescavors can devour nearly anything. If the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors ignore its hardness if it is made of any substance other than adamantine. Additionally, every round that a creature is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin devouring one object on the creature-if the vescavor swarm is not under the control of a vescavor queen, refer to Pathfinder Core Rulebook 216 Table 9-2. Once the vescavors choose an item in this way, they continue to devour that same item until it is destroyed. The object takes half its maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken condition, it is destroyed. An attended or magic object can make a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Traumatizing (Su)
    desc: Enduring the presence of a vescavor swarm is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature that spends more than 3 consecutive rounds inside a vescavor swarm must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or gain one of the types of madness presented on page 250 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide. Roll on the Types of Insanity table to determine which type of insanity affects the creature. Despite each entry listing a DC, the creature does not receive an additional Will save to prevent the insanity. This affliction is permanent, but can be healed as detailed in the Curing Insanity section of the Sanity and Madness rules. The save DC is Charisma-based.

desc_short: With a gibbering chorus, hundreds of toothy insects swarm together, their heads nothing more than maws filled with a sickly green glow.

# Description
Once found only in the lightless crevices and shrieking half-live jungles of the Abyss, the yammering, gluttonous vermin of the Abyss called vescavors crawl through portals into the Material Plane to feed and spawn. Ruled by enormous, hideous queens who direct their swarms in finding food and destroying foes with the help of pheromones and mental commands, vescavor swarms devour objects, creatures, and structures alike. Their hunger is insatiable and carries with it the terrors of the Abyss itself, warping the minds of even those creatures who escape the vescavors’ maws. Only adamantine can endure their gnashing teeth, and a swarm of vescavors that descends upon a settlement devours everything and leaves nothing behind.
