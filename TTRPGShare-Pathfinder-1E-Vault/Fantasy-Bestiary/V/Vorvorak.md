special_abilities:
  - name: Canal Walker (Ex)
    desc: A vorvorak ignores difficult terrain caused by deep or shallow bogs, and the DCs of its Acrobatics and Stealth checks are not increased for being in a bog.
  - name: Confident (Ex)
    desc: A vorvorak is self-assured in its ability to take on any foe. It gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Poisonous Bile: Spit-contact; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str damage and 1d4 Dex damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Spit (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action usable every 1d4 rounds, a vorvorak can expel a stream of poisonous water in a 60-foot line, dealing 8d8 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 20 half) to creatures in the area and exposing them to the vorvorak’s poison. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Sweeping Tail (Ex)
    desc: A vorvorak’s tail seems to have a mind of its own. If a vorvorak does not take a full-round action on its turn, it can make a tail slap attack as a swift action. In addition, the vorvorak can make one extra attack of opportunity each round, but this extra attack must be its tail slap. It can make this additional attack of opportunity (but not its normal attack of opportunity) even when flat-footed.

# Description
Vorvoraks are large, intelligent crocodilians with shadowy magical powers. These reclusive creatures most often make their lairs in the abandoned canals that crisscross the Taldan plains. More commonly known as “canal dragons” or “brown dragons,” vorvoraks are unrelated to true dragons and lack the many abilities and resistances of those more famous creatures. Even so, vorvoraks present a danger to those who intrude upon their claimed territories.

 A vorvorak’s body is roughly the shape of a dragon, while its head is that of a crocodile. What can appear at first to be wings on its back are in fact a pair of hard fins. A vorvorak’s scales are usually muddy brown in color, occasionally accented with moss-green spots or stripes.

 An average vorvorak is 24 feet long from nose to tail and weighs around 3,000 pounds.
