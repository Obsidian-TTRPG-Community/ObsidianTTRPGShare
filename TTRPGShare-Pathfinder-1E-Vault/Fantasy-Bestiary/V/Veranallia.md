special_abilities:
  - name: Autumnal Embrace (Su)
    desc: At will, a veranallia can make any creature within 30 feet barren or sterile. The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or lose any ability it has to reproduce or bear children. This effect can be removed only by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Creatures that reproduce magically are not affected by this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Bounteous Caster (Su)
    desc: Once per day, a veranallia can use the Eschew Materials feat to eschew any material component for a spell, regardless of the cost of the material component.
  - name: Rebirth (Su)
    desc: Once per day, a veranallia can reincarnate a willing creature she deems worthy of the honor. The creature’s original body decays and sinks into the ground, affecting the surrounding area in a half-mile radius as though with plant growth (enrichment). Over the course of 1d4 days, a white, flowery cocoon emerges from the affected ground and splits open, revealing the newly reincarnated creature inside. Creatures reincarnated by a veranallia always return to life as aasimars. This ability otherwise functions as per reincarnate (CL 20th).
  - name: Spells
    desc: Veranallias cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities, and can choose their spells from either the cleric spell list or the druid spell list.
  - name: Winter Sickle (Ex)
    desc: At will as a free action, a veranallia can create a jagged blade from her hoarfrost-covered vines that acts as a +3 icy burst sickle. One round after it leaves the veranallia’s grasp, the weapon melts into a small puddle of water.

# Description
Veranallias are among the most powerful azatas known and embody the changing of the seasons, from blossoming spring to dormant winter. They command the growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds. 

Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia has a form that combines aspects of a beautiful woman and the subtle power of nature. A veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs should be, she instead sprouts countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds. 

Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, realms where few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. Veranallias are creatures of transition, preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium’s edges to the more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes. Many among their kind can be found in the lush fields or various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium, particularly woodlands where the flora changes color almost at random. It is thought the annual tribunals of elder veranallias are actually the source of the eldritch woodland’s transformative climate and shifting composition. 

At first glance, a veranallia’s body appears to be wrapped in foliage, but these vines are actually a part of the azata’s strange physiology. She is not subject to blight or similar plants affecting magic, but attempts to use such abilities to hinder her provoke a veranallia’s ire like little else. A veranallia’s vines can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance based on the veranallia’s environment, but not always in a predictable or sensible manner. 

Veranallias often prefer the company of other azatas, and often have a following of faithful bralanis or ghaeles. Their volatile natures can make it quite difficult for many other creatures, even other azatas- to be involved with them. For example, lillends are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines’ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 37) belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and agathions have trouble following a veranallia’s leaps in logic and rapidly shifting moods.
