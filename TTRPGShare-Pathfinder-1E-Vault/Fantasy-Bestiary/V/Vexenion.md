  - name: Organisation
    desc: solitary, pair, or hunger (3-6)
  - name: Treasure
    desc: standard
special_abilities:
  - name: Absorption (Su)
    desc: Though a vexenion has no orifice with which to swallow, it can directly absorb a pinned target as a swift action. In most ways, this ability is identical to swallow whole, except no hole is left in the qlippoth’s body after a creature cuts its way out. A vexenion can absorb no more than one Large or smaller creature at a time and cannot absorb creatures larger than itself. If a creature dies while absorbed by the vexenion, the qlippoth immediately expels the corpse, along with its possessions, and is healed of 3d6 points of damage.
  - name: Compression (Ex)
    desc: A vexenion can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing. However, if it has absorbed a creature, its movement is restricted by the size of the absorbed creature.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    desc: A creature that succumbs to a vexenion’s horrific appearance becomes sickened for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting gaze attack.
  - name: Stony Form (Su)
    desc: By concentrating for 1 minute, a vexenion can withdraw its tentacles and eyes and form a stony shell around its body. In this form, it gains a +6 enhancement bonus to its natural armor and gains damage reduction 10/bludgeoning, but it cannot move or take physical actions. It can emerge from this form as a full-round action, but doing so leaves it staggered for 1 round.
  - name: Tentacular Versatility (Ex)
    desc: A vexenion’s tentacles are treated as primary attacks. As a swift action at the start of its turn, a vexenion can devote one or more of its four tentacles to movement or defense, reducing the number of tentacle attacks it can make in that round by the same amount. Each tentacle devoted to movement increases the vexenion’s base speed and climb speed by 5 feet. Each tentacle devoted to defense grants the vexenion a +1 dodge bonus to its AC for 1 round.

# Description
The Abyssal realm of Sekatar-Seraktis is a byword for chaos, contested by 13 different potential rulers split between bickering <%MONSTESR%Balor">balor lords, vavakias, and vrolikais, yet all leave the portion of the plane claimed by the qlippoth lord Yamasoth alone. The Kingdom of New Flesh is populated by the unholy experiments of the qlippoth lord, ravenous monstrosities who feed upon one another and any other beings so foolish or unlucky as to wind up in this accursed place. Some of the most fecund of these experiments are called vexenions, and they have proliferated across the Abyss. These abominations have the appearance of enormous bloated, pulsating tumors, mouthless, armed with muscular tentacles sprouting from their glistening form and gifted with bulging eyes capable of protruding from their bodies and just as quickly disappearing into their shuddering wet flesh.

 A vexenion feeds on flesh by physically absorbing creatures into its own amorphous form through its membranous skin. The ingested creature is slowly dissolved by the qlippoth’s acid. Once the flesh is consumed, the victim’s bones and other indigestible parts are expelled, and the vexenion moves on to its next meal, forever hunting, forever hungry.

 Vexenions often serve as shock troops in qlippoth armies, sent in the vanguard of attacks to break the formations of an advancing force, grappling and absorbing enemy soldiers in their path. While it is believed that Yamasoth employs these sickening things to gather material for its own endless experiments, the qlippoth lord seems to care little where the vexenions travel. For this reason, the creatures proliferate like a plague across the Abyss. Perhaps this is Yamasoth’s ultimate intent.

 Vexenions are at home in nearly any environment where they can find flesh on which to feast, though they often lair in places where they might easily ambush prey: demonic crossroads, ruins, and blasted forests where they can use the high limbs and trunks of dead trees to ambulate above their unknowing prey. In fact, this is the qlippoth’s preferred method of stalking potential meals: suspended above, employing their impressive climbing skills to move from tree to tree. Caverns of stalactites or the pillars of ruined demon cities can serve the same purpose for them.

 Despite their hideous, almost ooze-like appearance, vexenions are intelligent creatures. They lack the apparatus for speech but delight in telepathically sharing their hungers and the flavors of their food with others around them, impassively inquiring about their victim’s favored flavors and meals. The vexenion’s unsettling habit of sharing the flavors of a creature it feeds upon with that creature as it digests them is perhaps the qlippoth’s most sadistic trait.

 Temples of Yamasoth and other places where his otherworldly and malign presence has infected the world, such as the deeper levels of Hollow Mountain, are no stranger to the predations of the vexenion. Dungeon complexes are well loved by these qlippoth, and despite their prodigious size, their malleable bodies allow them to slither and squirt and force themselves through narrow confines-provided their bodies are not currently engorged upon a still-solid and still-struggling meal.
