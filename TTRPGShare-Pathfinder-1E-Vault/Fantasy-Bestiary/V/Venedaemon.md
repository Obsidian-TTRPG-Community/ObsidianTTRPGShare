# Description
The venedaemon personifies death by magic, and so has an inborn talent for all manner of sorcery. Though as hungry for souls as any other member of its daemonic kin, the venedaemon thirsts equally for intangible wealth through the acquisition of knowledge. 

Venedaemons are gaunt, and despite standing close to 7 feet tall, they rarely weigh more than 150 pounds.
