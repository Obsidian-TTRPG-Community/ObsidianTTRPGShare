# Description
One of the most famous tsukumogami is the one-eyed and one-legged umbrella creature known as kasaobake, a creature that is alternately creepy, curious, and mischievous. Kasa-obake are as likely to scare a creature away as they are to assist it, though their seemingly unpredictable nature always has a pattern behind it. For instance, most kasa-obake react more positively to those who treat their belongings well. Kasa-obake can be sources of wisdom if approached correctly, but they are also likely to tell amusing tall tales instead of the truth.
