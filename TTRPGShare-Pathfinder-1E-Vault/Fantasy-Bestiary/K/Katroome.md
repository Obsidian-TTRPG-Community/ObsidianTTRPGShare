# Description
Brilliantly beautiful but nearly as elusive as the breeze, the caterpillar-like katroome is a little creature with an enormous ego. Katroomes are rare and mostly live deep within forests or similar uninhabited areas. Most travelers confuse them with fey creatures, given their magical abilities, capriciousness, and haughty demeanors. In reality, they are magical beasts that almost never reveal themselves to others unless they wish.

Katroomes tend to view themselves as monarchs of their surroundings. They don’t believe themselves superior to all others in their demesnes; they simply think that it’s their birthright to protect their homelands and natural surroundings. In turn, they expect to be treated with the respect such a position deserves. To those unfamiliar with a katroome’s ways, the creature might come across as overbearing or imperious. Even to those who might compliment its beauty, a katroome might condescendingly issue a correction: “I’m not beautiful,” one might say, “I am regal.”

Travelers typically encounter katroomes because the creatures are curious about any visitors in their realm. If the travelers seem innocuous and prove that they understand a katroome’s internalized hierarchy of the area, the katroome might aid them with information. If the travelers are wicked or have disrespected the katroome or its home, the creature might stalk them, using its compulsion abilities and its natural webbing to play malicious pranks on the party.

In addition to katroomes’ self-assigned roles as protectors and emissaries of the forest, they are also rather avaricious, although they’ll never admit it. Katroomes love savory culinary items that might appeal to a typical human. They are also enamored of magic, particularly wondrous items. A katroome might descend from its verdant perch to approach a traveler on the pretense of asking her intentions, when in reality, the katroome is merely curious about the shiny brooch on her cloak.

A 5th-level spellcaster can gain a katroome as a familiar if she has the Improved Familiar feat, although the katroome usually believes that the caster is the true familiar.
