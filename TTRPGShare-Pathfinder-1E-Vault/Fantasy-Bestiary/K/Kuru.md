# Description
Kuru are savage natives of the Shackles, dreadfully transformed by their loathsome “goddess,” the Blood Queen. While most kuru live in small tribal villages in or around Ghol-Gan ruins, some choose to abandon their cultic faith and seek adventure beyond the islands from which they hail, though such individuals are extremely rare.
