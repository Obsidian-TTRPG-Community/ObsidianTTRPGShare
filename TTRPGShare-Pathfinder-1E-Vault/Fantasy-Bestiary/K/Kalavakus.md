special_abilities:
  - name: Enslave Soul (Su)
    desc: A kalavakus can attempt to enslave the soul of any mortal creature within 60 feet as a swift action. The kalavakus must have line of sight to the target. The target can resist this special attack with a DC 18 Will save, but is staggered for 1 round even if the save is successful. If the save is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save is a failure, the target’s soul is enslaved-this creature takes a -6 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws against that kalavakus. If a creature with an enslaved soul is slain by that kalavakus, the soul immediately infuses the demon’s body, affecting it with a heal spell (CL 12th). A kalavakus can have only one mortal soul enslaved at a time-if it enslaves a second soul, the first is released. This is a mind-affecting death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horns (Ex)
    desc: The kalavakus’s numerous horns can easily catch weapons and yank them away from opponents. The demon gains a +4 racial bonus on all disarm attempts as a result.

# Description
Known to some as “horned demons,” the kalavakus demons are hulking, muscled beasts. They work as slavers on the Abyss, sometimes as harem keepers or captains of the guard for a more powerful demon, and at other times as mercenaries who sell their captured victims for profit to anyone with the funds to pay. 

A kalavakus is 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds. They form from the souls of evil mortals who were slavers in their mortal lives.
