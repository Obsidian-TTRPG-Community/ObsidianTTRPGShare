# Description
The kakapo is a small, flightless parrot native to tropical islands. Primarily nocturnal creatures, the birds come out at night to forage for fruits, nuts, plants, and seeds. Kakapos can live to be over 100 years old, breeding only two or three times per decade.

A kakapo is roughly 2 feet long from beak to tail tip and can weigh up to 9 pounds.
