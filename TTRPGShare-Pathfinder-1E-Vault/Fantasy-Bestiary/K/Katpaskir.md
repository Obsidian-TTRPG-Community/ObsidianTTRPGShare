special_abilities:
  - name: Breaching (Su)
    desc: When a katpaskir calls or summons a demon or creature with the fiendish simple template into an area where the summoned creature’s entry would be blocked by a magical effect (such as magic circle against evil, forbiddance, or dimensional lock), it can force the caster or creator of the effect to attempt a caster level check against the katpaskir’s spell resistance. On a failed check, the blocking effect is immediately and permanently negated.
  - name: Distance Distortion (Su)
    desc: Reality bends and warps within 30 feet of a katpaskir. The demon moves and attacks normally through this distorted area, but other creatures within this area treat all distances as if they were double the actual distance for all purposes, including movement, range for spells, and ranged attacks. In addition, a creature that begins its turn within this aura must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or be slowed for 1 round (as the slow spell). Freedom of movement prevents the slow effect but not any of the other effects of the distance distortion aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mirror of the Tainted Rift (Su)
    desc: When one or more creature with the celestial simple template is summoned as part of the spell or ability within 30 feet of a katpaskir, the katpaskir can, as an immediate action, summon an equal number of creatures of the same type with the fiendish simple template. If a good-aligned outsider is called or summoned within 30 feet of a katpaskir, it can duplicate the calling or summoning spell as an immediate action, calling or summoning one or more demons as if it had cast the same spell.
  - name: Teleportation Disruption (Su)
    desc: When a creature uses a teleportation effect to enter or leave a space within 30 feet of a katpaskir, the caster must immediately attempt a caster level check (DC equal to the katpaskir’s spell resistance). On a failed check, the teleportation effect is negated. If it chooses, the katpaskir can instead redirect the arrival location of the teleportation effect to any unoccupied space within 120 feet.
  - name: Warp Sense (Ex)
    desc: A katpaskir can automatically sense disruptions in the planar fabric within 1 mile. The demon is immediately aware of any conjuration effect used within this area, and it also knows the direction and approximate distance. When a teleportation effect is used within 1 mile of a katpaskir (including arriving within this area from somewhere else), the demon can use clairaudience/clairvoyance as an immediate action centered on the point the teleportation effect originated from or the point the teleportation effect is directed at as long as the point is within 1 mile; if both points are within 1 mile, the katpaskir can use clairaudience/clairvoyance centered on both.

desc_short: Four clawed arms sprout from this fiend’s chest like the limbs of a buried insect struggling to crawl free. Overlapping iridescent plates of chitin cascade down the monster’s back, shrouding four membranous dragonfly wings.

# Description
Katpaskirs are a pox and pestilence upon not just the world, but reality itself. Just as bugs burrow into unwatched crevices, katpaskirs pry their way into other realms and dimensions. They gnaw and scratch and grind away at the edges of the universe, the planar junctures where the folds of creation bend in upon themselves. They have an uncanny sense for finding natural rifts, portals, and convergences, and they seek ever for ways to expand and untether these natural gates. By setting them loose to drift across the world, they unhinge the orderly substrate of the multiverse, casting all into primordial chaos as the planes unravel. Their voices are strange and echoing, like several voices sounding together, each distorted and cacophonous and rising and falling asynchronously in pitch and volume. When not actively engaged in a task, katpaskirs tend to stand perfectly still, with the exception of its insectlike limbs, which rhythmically stroke the air in front of them. When other creature come near-or if some teleporting creature triggers the demon’s warp sense special ability-it snaps out of this self-imposed stasis, ready to attack. Katpaskirs are a little over 7 feet tall and weigh just less than 600 pounds.
