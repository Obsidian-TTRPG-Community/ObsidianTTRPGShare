special_abilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    desc: While in an alternate form, a kasthezvi retains its special abilities. A kasthezvi can remain in an alternate form for up to 8 hours each day.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    desc: When killed, a kasthezvi explodes in a 100-foot-radius burst of long-suppressed sound. This burst deals 16d6 points of sonic damage and permanently deafens creatures in the area. Affected creatures can attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half and negate the deafness. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soundless (Ex)
    desc: A kasthezvi never causes sound through its actions, whether mundane or magical, except when it uses its word of sundering ability. This includes its movement, abilities, contact with other creatures or objects, attempts at vocalization, spell effects, and any other possible sources of sound. This does not prevent sounds made by the victims of its attacks. A kasthezvi that can cast spells does so as if its spells were modified by the Silent Spell feat, but without increasing the spell’s level or casting time.
  - name: Subsonic Touch (Su)
    desc: A kasthezvi’s touch is a touch attack that deals 1d8 points of damage that bypasses damage reduction, plus 12d6 sonic damage. Though this additional damage is sonic damage, it makes no audible noise.
  - name: Word of Sundering (Su)
    desc: Once per minute, a kasthezvi can speak a silent word of sundering; this takes 1 full round. When it finishes speaking the word at the beginning of its next turn, the kasthezvi targets a 40-foot-radius spread within 800 feet. This area is targeted by an earthquake spell. In addition, creatures in the area take 8d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 21 half) and unattended nonmagical objects of ceramic, crystal, glass, or porcelain in the area silently break into dozens of pieces, as if affected by a shatter spell. The kasthezvi’s caster level for these effects is equal to its racial Hit Dice (CL 16th for most kasthezvis). If the kasthezvi is killed, stunned, or otherwise prevented from vocalizing while uttering its word of sundering, the word ends with no effect. If a kasthezvi speaks a word of sundering while it has changed its shape, it immediately reverts to its true form. This is a sonic effect, though it is not blocked by spells or effects that create silence. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Malicious and immortal, kasthezvis are among the most ancient creatures inhabiting the deep places beneath Kaer Maga. Their long-dead creators crafted these abominations to be utterly incapable of causing sound, as their very bones are vessels for primal words of power.

 If a kasthezvi could fully speak the primordial words etched into its bones, it could cause catastrophic devastation with a simple phrase. However, kasthezvis’ creators intended kasthezvis to contain and conceal the words, not use them, and etched primordial silence onto the kasthezvis’ souls. This suppressive magic has slowly deteriorated with each passing century, and as it has, kasthezvis have drawn strength from the ancient words contained within. They are now capable of issuing powerful, silent utterances that can level entire buildings. Given time, there is no telling the extent of their power.

 A kasthezvi’s body is roughly humanoid in shape, though otherwise alien in appearance. Its dry, cracked skin stretches across misshapen bones. Its skull is typically at an unnatural angle to its body, and its silently screaming face is asymmetrical. A crown of bone floats above its head, vibrating erratically. A kasthezvi’s every movement appears deceptively lurching and uncoordinated.

 A kasthezvi is 6 feet tall but weighs only 100 pounds.
