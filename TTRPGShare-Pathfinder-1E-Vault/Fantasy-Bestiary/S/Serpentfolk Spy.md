# Description
A serpentfolk spy monitors activity in surface settlements, noting authority figures, defenses, and those who could be bribed or coerced into serving the serpentfolk empire. While most serpentfolk spies describe their professions in terms of analyzing weaknesses and preparing for the eventual large-scale assault on the surface world, the truth is that many spies (and their masters) have immediate goals in mind. Spies often stake out powerful priests and arcanists, posing as fellow scholars or simple servitors, in order to gain access to knowledge and arcane lore not readily available in their subterranean caverns. Given their long life spans and reptilian patience, these individuals may infiltrate an organization and stay implanted there for years, waiting for a choice artifact or tome to present itself. Once it does, the spy absconds with the relic and retreats back to the serpentfolk city of its paymasters-killing any warmbloods who stand in its way.
