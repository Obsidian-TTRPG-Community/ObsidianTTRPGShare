special_abilities:
  - name: Death Roll (Ex)
    desc: When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a saltwater crocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The crocodile deals its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    desc: A saltwater crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
  - name: Lunging Bite (Ex)
    desc: Once per minute, a saltwater crocodile can extend the reach of its bite attack by 5 feet without taking the normal penalties to AC associated with the Lunge feat. This extended reach applies only to the crocodile’s bite attack and lasts until the start of the creature’s next turn.

# Description
Native to tropical saltwater estuaries and the freshwater rivers that feed them, saltwater crocodiles are among the largest form of non-primordial crocodilian on Golarion. Adult saltwater crocodiles can reach lengths upward of 20 feet and weights of over 2,000 pounds, and are typically more lethargic than their smaller kin, spending their days sunning themselves on land or in shallow water and hunting at night.
