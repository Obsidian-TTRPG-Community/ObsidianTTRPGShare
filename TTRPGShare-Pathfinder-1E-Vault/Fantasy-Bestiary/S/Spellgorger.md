special_abilities:
  - name: Deflective Shield (Su)
    desc: A spellgorger is surrounded by a magical shield of energy that grants it a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Charisma modifier (+8 for most spellgorgers).
  - name: Discordant Field (Su)
    desc: Whenever a spellgorger moves more than 5 feet in a round, it becomes surrounded by a disruptive field of magically energized motes that interfere with the spellcasting of any creature within 30 feet. Any attempt to cast a spell within this area while the discordant field is active requires a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + double the level of the spell being cast). If this check fails, the spell is lost and the spellcaster must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1 round by magical feedback generated by the field (this is a mind-affecting effect). Spellgorgers are immune to the effects of this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    desc: When a spellgorger engulfs a creature, the ooze can choose to maintain a bubble of air around the engulfed creature’s head so that it need not fear suffocation. An engulfed creature gains the pinned condition as normal, but does not take any additional damage from being engulfed.
  - name: Firebolts (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a spellgorger can expel up to four bolts of burning magical force. It can direct these firebolts at any target within 60 feet (no range increment) but cannot target a single creature with more than one firebolt. A creature struck by a firebolt takes 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of force damage.
  - name: Immune to Force Effects (Ex)
    desc: A spellgorger is immune to force damage, and can pass through force effects (such as those created by a forcecage and a wall of force) as if they did not exist. When it attacks a target, it ignores any armor bonuses granted to that foe from force effects (such as those created by bracers of armor, mage armor, and shield).
  - name: Parasitic Spellcasting (Su)
    desc: If a spellgorger has engulfed a creature capable of casting spells, it can cast any one of the creature’s known spells that has a casting time of one full-round action or less (using the spell’s casting time as normal); when it does so, it is treated as the spell’s caster. The spellgorger must supply any components for casting the spell in question-if the spell requires the use of focus or material components, the spellgorger can use any components carried by the engulfed spellcaster as if it had those components. A spell cast in this way is considered expended by the engulfed spellcaster, and all spell effects resolve at the engulfed spellcaster’s caster level (but are not further enhanced by feats or abilities the engulfed spellcaster may have).
  - name: Prehensile Tendrils (Ex)
    desc: A spellgorger’s tendrils are capable of fine manipulation, such as that required for somatic components when casting spells or handling material components. It cannot use these tendrils to effectively wield weapons, but can use them to activate relatively small handheld magical items like wands (though not larger items like staves).
  - name: Scent Magic (Ex)
    desc: A spellgorger has the scent ability, but can smell only creatures with active spell effects or magic items that exude magical auras.
  - name: Spell Healing (Su)
    desc: Whenever a spellgorger uses its parasitic spellcasting ability, it regains a number of hit points equal to double the level of the spell it cast. If the spellgorger is at maximum hit points, it gains temporary hit points equal to this amount instead. These temporary hit points do not stack. A spellgorger gains no sustenance (or healing) from casting 0-level spells in this manner.

# Description
Spellgorgers are among the more terrifying threats that face an adventuring spellcaster-shapeless entities that feed on magic. Rarely encountered in large numbers, spellgorgers are most common in remote reaches of the Darklands, where they often prey upon the numerous spellcasting races that dwell below, such as the drow, duergar, derro, and svirfneblin. A spellgorger prefers the “taste” of arcane magic, but can feed on divine and psychic magic as well.

A spellgorger resembles a floating sphere of violet sludge that exudes a slithery forest of fine tendrils and sparks of magical energy. A typical specimen is 10 feet in diameter and weighs 1,000 pounds, but spellgorgers’ supernatural ability to fly and swift reflexes belie their massive bulk and weight.
