special_abilities:
  - name: Aura of Madness (Su)
    desc: Any sane being within 30 feet of a conscious seugathi savant must succeed at a DC 21 Will save each round or become confused for 1 round. A creature that fails five saves in a row becomes permanently insane, as the insanity spell. A seugathi savant can suppress or activate this aura as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Confusion Command (Su)
    desc: As an immediate action, a seugathi savant can issue a telepathic command to a confused creature within 30 feet. This allows the seugathi savant to pick a result from the confusion behavior table, rather than the confused creature rolling randomly for its actions that round.
  - name: Item Use (Ex)
    desc: A seugathi savant can utilize spell-trigger devices as if it were a spellcaster of the appropriate class. As a free action, it can identify all spell-trigger properties of an item it is touching. Use Magic Device is a class skill for seugathi savants.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Wis damage and deafness; cure 2 consecutive saves. Deafness persists as long as the ability damage caused by the poison lasts. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Worm-like monstrosities engorged on the thoughts of prophets and mystics, seugathi savants differ from their lesser kin in their immense size and their inherent talent for psychic magic. Like all seugathi, savants are driven by mental compulsions instilled by their neothelid masters. However, they perceive more of their masters’ eons-spanning schemes than most other seugathi, and the neothelids grant them greater flexibility in achieving these goals. Seugathi savants dismiss ordinary seugathi as unworthy drones and largely ignore them, while seugathi revere savants as wiser, older siblings-much to the irritation of the savants. A seugathi savant measures 35 feet long and weighs 7,000 pounds.
