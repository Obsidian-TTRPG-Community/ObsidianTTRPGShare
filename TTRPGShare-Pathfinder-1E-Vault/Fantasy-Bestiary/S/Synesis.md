special_abilities:
  - name: Cognitive Aura (Su)
    desc: As a standard action, a synesis can create an aura of thought that bolsters deliberate contemplation at the cost of one’s instinctive judgment or an aura of intuition that does the opposite. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw to resist the aura. A creature that successfully saves against the aura is unaffected by that synesis’s aura for 24 hours. A synesis can choose up to two creatures in the area to ignore its effects.

 Intuition: The aura grants all non-aeon creatures a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class as well as a -3 penalty on concentration checks. This penalty on concentration checks doubles for creatures when the affected creature casts spells with a thought component.

 Thought: The aura grants all non-aeon creatures the benefits of the synesis’s extension of all ability as well as a +3 bonus on concentration checks. This bonus on concentration checks doubles when the affected creature casts spells with a thought component. At the same time, the affected creature takes a -1 penalty on Will saves (-2 against mind-affecting effects).
  - name: Unintuitive Reach (Su)
    desc: A synesis can stretch its arms and body in unpredictable ways, but only when it would defy the expectations of others. A synesis’s reach increases by 5 feet when it attacks a non-aeon creature with an Intelligence score. When it makes an attack against such a creature using its unintuitive reach, it deals an additional 2d6 points of precision damage, after which the target is immune to further such precision damage for 24 hours.

# Description
Although mortals have learned to control tiny fragments of their worlds through magic and technology, only a mastery over their instinctive urges prevents them from destroying the fabric of the planes in the process. Synesis aeons oversee this fine balance. At times, they serve as dispassionate muses to great thinkers, facilitating discoveries and pushing cultures to new heights. In the blink of an eye, however, a synesis might destroy a philosopher whose hypotheses could one day threaten the balance. Synesis aeons often gravitate toward powerful psychic spellcasters, steering them toward actions that stave off planar entropy or serve even more esoteric goals.
