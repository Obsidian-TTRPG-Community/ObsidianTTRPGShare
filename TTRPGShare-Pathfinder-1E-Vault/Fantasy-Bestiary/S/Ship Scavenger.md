# Description
Hunting below the waves secures only a precarious living, and forges don’t burn underwater. To acquire worked goods and supplement their income, many Low Azlanti turn to scavenging. Shipwrecks, storm-washed flotsam, and jetsam abandoned to dodge customs officers all offer a wealth of goods now beyond the reach of their human creators and free to any aquatic creature strong and brave enough to claim them. Those gillmen who pick the bones of sunken hulks must compete with other ocean-going scavengers, from sharks and giant crabs to sahuagin. Fierce battles can erupt over new opportunities, just as surface peoples may battle over a mine or treasure-laden tomb. Truly successful scavengers often conceal or booby-trap their most lucrative discoveries, or recruit additional gillmen to help them guard a find and swiftly pick it clean. Groups of gillmen ranging in size from small gangs to large organized companies may claim especially treacherous waters and identify these jagged reefs, stormwracked passes, and monster-infested shoals with distinct markers, which canny sailors learn to use for navigation.

While most ship scavengers content themselves with recovering lost treasures from past accidents or battles, a greedy few cause shipwrecks by moving buoys, extinguishing lighthouses, disseminating false charts, and sabotaging vessels. The worst are little better than pirates, prying ships apart from below the waves or setting them aflame, then slaughtering the crew as they leap into the ocean. Whether they’re malign or merely opportunistic, ship scavengers are unlikely to share a wreck’s treasures, even-or especially-with its air-breathing former owners.
