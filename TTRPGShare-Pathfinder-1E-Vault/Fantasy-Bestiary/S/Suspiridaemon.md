    desc: standard
special_abilities:
  - name: Concussive Gasp (Su)
    desc: Once per day as a standard action, a suspiridaemon can inhale with such sudden force as to evacuate the air in its proximity, causing a sudden wave of air pressure from the implosion. Every creature within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 5d6 points of sonic damage and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that succeeds at this save takes half damage and is not sickened. A suspiridaemon cannot perform this ability if it is currently grappling a creature with its tongue. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Suffocate (Ex)
    desc: A creature affected by the daemon’s strangle ability cannot breathe and must hold its breath. Because of the daemon’s thin air aura, this can quickly render an opponent unconscious.
  - name: Thin Air (Su)
    desc: A suspiridaemon’s aura makes the air within 30 feet of it difficult to breathe. Creatures that need to breathe can hold their breath only half as long as normal while within this aura, and suffer from altitude effects as if on a low peak or in a high pass (see Altitude Zones on page 430 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    desc: The tongue of a suspiridaemon is a primary attack and always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus on damage rolls.

# Description
Horrid, vulture-headed fiends whose very presence makes the air difficult to breathe, suspiridaemons personify death by suffocation and strangulation. Their flesh is discolored and blotched like the stagnant blood under a suffocated corpse’s skin, they don’t breathe, and their bodies convulse and twitch like those of hanging victims. A suspiridaemon enjoys nothing more than the last choked gasp of a victim as it wraps its tongue around the creature’s throat. Thanks to its utterly silent demeanor, it excels at committing slow, gruesome murders while hiding in the shadows. The only time a suspiridaemon makes a noticeable noise is when it loosens the tissues around its neck and inhales a booming breath- the sudden loss of air that results is enough to make foes fall ill. 

A suspiridaemon is 6 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.
