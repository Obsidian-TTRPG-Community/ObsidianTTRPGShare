    desc: standard
special_abilities:
  - name: Ambient Knowledge (Ex)
    desc: As long as it is within 60 feet of a library or a soul tome, a scrivenite gains an insight bonus on all Knowledge checks equal to its Hit Dice (typically +5 for most scrivenites), and it can attempt Knowledge checks untrained.
  - name: Clever Defense (Ex)
    desc: A scrivenite adds its Intelligence bonus as a deflection bonus to its Armor Class. Any condition that causes a scrivenite to lose its Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class also causes it to lose the benefit of this ability.
  - name: Ribbon Lash (Ex)
    desc: A scrivenite’s primary weapons are its silken ribbon bookmarks. Each ribbon lash deals 1d4 points of slashing damage and 1 point of Intelligence damage. A successful DC 16 Will save negates the Intelligence damage. The save DC is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Soul Tome (Su)
    desc: Whenever a scrivenite deals Intelligence damage, the stolen knowledge manifests as a soul tome in its possession. A new soul tome is created for each different creature that a scrivenite damages in this way, and further Intelligence damage dealt to that creature causes the soul tome to swell and become more elaborate. This Intelligence damage can be restored naturally over time, by magic, or by a creature reading from its own soul tome in order to restore the stolen memories. Every 30 minutes spent in study heals 1 point of Intelligence damage.

 A creature who takes an amount of Intelligence damage equal to its Intelligence score in this way falls comatose. Once comatose, the victim doesn’t heal ability damage naturally and must be revived using magic or by destroying the soul tome. A break enchantment or restoration spell cast on the soul tome restores the stolen memories imprisoned in the book and restores any Intelligence damage affecting the victim.

 Any creature can spend 30 minutes reading a soul tome in order to learn the secrets and knowledge that the target once possessed. A soul tome is always written in the target’s native tongue. No check is necessary to read the book. The contents of a soul tome can vary wildly. Some may contain only minor trivia about the creature’s life, while others might contain important secrets. Soul tomes have hardness 0 and 5 hit points. They crumble to dust once the stolen knowledge within them has been reclaimed or restored. The soul of a creature whose memories are recorded in a soul tome is not prevented from going on to the afterlife.
  - name: Tome Form (Ex)
    desc: As a swift action, a scrivenite can retract its body back into its book cover mask; it then appears to be a large, sturdily bound, but otherwise mundane tome. In this form, a scrivenite can take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a normal book. A scrivenite in tome form can still use its spell-like abilities, but it loses its ribbon lash attacks and the deflection bonus granted by its clever defense ability, and its speed is reduced to 5 feet.

  - name:
    desc: (CL 5; Concentration +9)
  - name: 3/day
    desc: comprehend languages, daze monster (DC 14), detect thoughts (DC 14), protection from chaos

desc_short: This humanoid-shaped figure of folded paper and silken ribbons hovers gently in the air. It wears the open cover of some great tome like a metal- and leather-bound mask.

# Description
Hailing from Axis, scrivenites act as the historians, cartographers, and archivists of the multiverse. They are literally woven together from knowledge, and every scrivenite contains a deep need to record anything and everything around it in excruciating detail. Terse and introverted in the extreme, scrivenites eschew the frippery of emotion and poetic license in order to preserve objectivity, and they detest the bias and constant revisions applied by fickle mortal minds to stated history. Most scrivenites refuse to see the big picture, and instead focus on minute details, only later collecting the individual facts in their vast libraries. They rarely measure the human suffering or triumph in any particular event. To them, the what, when, and where is more important than the who and why. By scrivenites’ estimation, weather can have as much impact on a nation’s ultimate fate as its leader, so both factors must be given equal merit.

Simply existing around information feeds and empowers a scrivenite; they take in the written word as effortlessly as a human breathes. Their understanding of memory and knowledge is so intuitive that scrivenites can extract whatever information they please from the minds of living creatures, binding these facts into elegant tomes unique to each “contributor.”

Scrivenites can manifest as large, sturdily bound books. Perusing their pages reveals swirling, ethereal wisps of text covering their forms. When active, they craft humanlike bodies from their own folded pages and can use their silken bookmarks as weapons. Scrivenites wear the open covers of their tomes as expressive masks. Though their sizes can vary greatly, most scrivenites stand taller than a halfling, but shorter than a human. Though they are made of pages upon pages of dense paperlike material, they weigh less than 50 pounds.
