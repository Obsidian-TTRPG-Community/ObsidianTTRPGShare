# Description
Skeletal mages are minor spellcasters (typically 5th-level or less) who have retained both their intelligence and their spellcasting abilities. These variant skeletal champions gain Silent Spell as a bonus feat. Like skeletal champions, skeletal mages cannot be created with animate dead-they only arise under rare conditions or through ancient, esoteric rituals.
