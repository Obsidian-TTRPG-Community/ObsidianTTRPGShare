special_abilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a shadow golem can exhale a 30-foot cone of shadows. All creatures caught in this area take 2d4 points of Strength damage and become staggered for 1 round. A successful DC 21 Fortitude save reduces the Strength damage to 2 points and negates the staggering effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    desc: A shadow golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. Any spell with the light or darkness descriptor cast directly on a shadow golem suppresses its shadow aura for 1 round per spell level (no save).A shadow conjuration or shadow evocation spell reactivates a shadow golem’s shadow aura if it had been suppressed and grants the shadow golem fast healing 5 for 10 rounds. The greater versions of these spells grant fast healing 10 for 20 rounds.Both sunbeam and sunburst affect a shadow golem normally. Shadow golems are considered to be particularly susceptible to sunlight for the purpose of resolving damage inflicted by either of these spells. If a shadow golem fails its saving throw against one of these spells, its shadow aura is suppressed for 1d8 rounds.A searing light spell that strikes a shadow golem deals no damage, but does slow it (as per the slow spell) for 1 round (no save).
  - name: Shadow Aura (Su)
    desc: A shadow golem constantly exudes an aura of eerie shadowy illumination, causing the area surrounding it to a distance of 60 feet to function as if illuminated by dim light, regardless of the ambient lighting (or lack thereof). As long as a shadow golem is in dim light (such as that granted by its own aura), it gains a +6 deflection bonus to its AC and gains the benefit of a constant air walk effect. A character who attempts to cast a spell with the darkness or light descriptor while within a shadow golem’s shadow aura must make a successful DC 25 caster level check, or the spell is countered as it is cast. At the start of any round in which the shadow golem’s aura interacts with an in-place darkness or light spell effect, that effect is automatically dispelled if the effect is from a spell whose level is 4th level or lower. If the effect is from a 5th-level or higher-level spell, the golem’s shadow aura attempts to dispel the effect as if via greater dispel magic (CL 20th). The golem’s shadow aura can attempt to dispel any amount of spells in this way, and if it fails to do so during one round, it can attempt to do so again at the start of each following round.

# Description
Among the most exotic of golems are the enigmatic shadow golems, animated constructs composed not of any mundane material but of pure shadowstuff harvested from the Shadow Plane. Tempered by magic, this strange substance holds a solid shape yet retains its eerie otherworldly features, allowing the shadow golem to walk on the air or to resist physical attacks that don’t cut deeply-and even then, only the sharpest of adamantine edges can do significant harm to one of these creatures.

Shadow golems are typically built in the form of hulking humanoids with skin and clothing as black as spilled ink. Despite their muscular forms, they can move with surprising speed, and weigh much less than one might expect a muscle-bound statue to weigh. While the creator of a shadow golem can fashion the construct into any shape, a strange element of the way the animating magic mixes with the raw shadowstuff results in an unusual side effect-the facial features of all shadow golems are indistinct, with the exception of two glowing eyes that are difficult to spot in the cloak of shadows that surrounds every shadow golem.

The typical shadow golem stands 11 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
