    desc: As it moves, the sepsidaemon covers the ground with portions of its festering body, transforming any square it passes through into difficult terrain for 2 rounds, after which the filth evaporates. A creature that passes through or starts its turn in one of these squares must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of acid damage and become nauseated for 1 round; the nausea effect is a disease effect.

# Description
Sepsidaemons embody the concept of death by gangrene, infection, and necrotic decay. Spawned in Abaddon from the evil souls of those who experienced horrific deaths under septic conditions, these daemons are most prominent in the areas of Apollyon’s domain where the waters of the Styx intrude and leach away life and memories. A sepsidaemon continually hunts, feeds, and appropriates the essences of creatures. These fiends perpetually slough a trail of necrotic flesh and exude a fearsome aura that festers and corrupts wounds. A sepsidaemon fuses its victims’ misappropriated forms to its amorphous core, where they dangle like rotting jewelry. Although sepsidaemons typically roam alone or in loose pairs, they are at their most fearsome when they form groups led by one of Apollyon’s leukodaemon deacons.
