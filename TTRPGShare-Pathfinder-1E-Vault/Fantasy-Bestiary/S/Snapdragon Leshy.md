  - name: Bloom Lasso (Ex)
    desc: A snapdragon leshy can create and throw a tendril as a standard action. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by Strength) and affects the target with the leshy’s crippling hysterics ability. This attack has a range increment of 20 feet and a maximum range of 100 feet.
  - name: Crippling Hysterics (Ex)
    desc: The snapdragon leshy’s bloom lasso drapes the target in clinging blossoms that release intoxicating pollen. Any creature struck by the lasso must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or giggle uncontrollably for 1d4+1 rounds. This condition imposes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks; while the effect lasts, the target must succeed at another DC 14 Fortitude saving throw at the end of its turn each round or fall prone in hysteria. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Whereas most leshys are reclusive and content to quietly nurture the natural world, snapdragon leshys are consummate extroverts. They often find their way into settled areas, where they caper and gab at those around them. When their neighbors are slow to laugh, snapdragon leshys sometimes resort to juvenile pranks to elicit a reaction. These escalating exploits often prompt townsfolk to chase off the plant people, which the leshys are quick to forgive so long as nobody comes to harm.
