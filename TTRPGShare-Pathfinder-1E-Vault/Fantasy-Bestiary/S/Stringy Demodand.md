    desc: Although the disgusting growths on a stringy demodand are technically part of its skin, the demodand has a small measure of control over these ropy appendages. As a swift action, a stringy demodand can use its growths to entangle any adjacent creatures of its size or smaller. To resist being entangled, a target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save. As long as the stringy demodand is entangling one or more creatures, any creature that moves adjacent to the demodand must successfully save or likewise be entangled. Entangled creatures can’t move farther than 5 feet from the stringy demodand until they break free from its growths. An entangled creature can break free as a move action by succeeding at a DC 25 Strength or Escape Artist check. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

# Description
Stringy demodands fulfill their duty to their titan masters as kidnappers and slave masters throughout the Abyssal realms. Stringy demodands’ agility allows them to quickly snatch up targets and prevent slave revolts before they start.

The stringy demodands’ long, obsidian-colored skin growths give the abhorrent outsiders their name. These fibers resemble nothing so much as elongated skin tags the girth of a human finger and are roughly 4 feet in length. The fibrous outgrowths sprout from their heads and the tips of their wings. These ropy feelers bob and sway wildly as a stringy demodand moves, creating a truly disturbing image for those victims who glimpse back at their Abyssal pursuer.

Because these rubbery strands cover most of the creatures’ bodies, they provide a measure of natural protection that allows stringy demodands to eschew armor. Stringy demodands are typically 6 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds.
