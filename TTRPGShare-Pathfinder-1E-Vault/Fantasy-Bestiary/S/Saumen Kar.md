special_abilities:
  - name: Frostbite Brands (Ex)
    desc: A saumen kar’s brands infuse the creature with intense cold, so much that it gains resistance to fire 20 and its touch deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. A saumen kar’s metallic weapons also conduct this chill. A saumen kar’s brands can be removed by the spell erase as though they were magic writing with a caster level equal to the saumen kar’s Hit Dice. If the brands are removed, the saumen kar loses both its fire resistance and its ability to do additional cold damage, until the following dawn when the brands re-etch themselves upon its body.
  - name: Snowstorm (Su)
    desc: In mimicry of its unforgiving environment, a saumen kar can transform into a living snowstorm of lethal power. This ability lasts as long and operates like the whirlwind special attack with the following changes: Creatures within the area of the snowstorm take 2d6 points of cold damage and 2d6 points of slashing damage and take a -20 penalty on Perception checks. A saumen kar gains a fly speed of 40 feet (perfect) while in this form.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    desc: While a saumen kar’s horns are not large enough for a gore attack, they extend under the skin to form a bony plate. A creature struck by a saumen kar’s headbutt must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.

# Description
This leathery-faced creature stands tall and upright, with long, simian limbs and a shaggy coat. Intelligent and powerful, saumen kars are not naturally aggressive, but the hostility of their environment forces them to defend the land that supports them with ferocity, even to the death. Their natural coloration and snow-packed fur make saumen kars almost invisible among the drifts of their icy homes, leading many arctic races to refer to them as “men of snow.” A longforgotten deal made by their race in its infancy still brutally scars the body of each saumen kar, marking them with their distinctive frostbite brands-though if this debt is already paid, lapsed, or growing ever greater, none can remember. An adult saumen kar stands 12 feet tall and weighs almost 2,000 pounds, but the ice and snow matted to its fur for both insulation and armor add another 1,000 pounds to its bulk.
