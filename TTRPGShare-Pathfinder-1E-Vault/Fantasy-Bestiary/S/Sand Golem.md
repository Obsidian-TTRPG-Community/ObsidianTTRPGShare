    desc: When a creature hits a sand golem with a manufactured melee weapon, the sand golem can make a disarm attempt as an immediate action. This disarm attempt doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. If the combat maneuver check is a success, the weapon is caught in the golem’s churning sands. A sand golem’s body can contain any number of weapons. A sand golem can make an attack with one captured weapon of its choice as a standard action or as part of its full attack, although attack rolls made with captured weapons take a -4 penalty. After attacking twice with a weapon, the weapon falls to the ground, landing 1d4 squares away from the sand golem.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    desc: A sand golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. An aqueous orb spell deals lethal damage instead of nonlethal damage to a sand golem A hydraulic torrent spell gains a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check as the torrent surges through a sand golem. Soften earth and stone causes a sand golem to lose its damage reduction for 3 rounds. A transmute mud to rock spell slows a sand golem (as per slow) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A transmute rock to mud spell restores 1d6 hit points per level of the caster to a sand golem (maximum 10d6).
  - name: Sand Blast (Su)
    desc: As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a sand golem can expel a 15-foot cone of fiery sand from its chest. Creatures struck by the blast take 4d6 points of fire damage and 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and become blinded for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at a DC 16 Reflex save takes half damage and negates the blindness. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
A sand golem is an animate mass of living sand, soft earth, and rocks first employed during the early period of the Jistka Imperium as the original defenders of the city’s many golemwork factories. Given the readily available crafting resources and plentiful artificers, the golems made effective and inexpensive additions to the Jistkans’ menagerie of creations. As time went on, Jistkan golem crafters also found that these golems proved equally useful on the front lines of battle. However, as Jistkan enemies began utilizing creatures from beyond the Material Plane, sand golems were eventually phased out in favor of bigger, more dangerous beings with far greater abilities. As conflicts with their neighbors eventually broke and scattered the Jistka Imperium, the knowledge of how to create these golems was lost to the sands of time.

 Hundreds of years later, Osiriani golem crafters delving into uncovered Jistkan catacombs eventually stumbled upon the knowledge of creating sand golems. Though the process was archaic, these crafters were able to once more produce new sand golems. When the time came to put their newly found treasure to the test, the artificers knew the perfect trial for their unearthed creations: defensive sentries in the scorching desert surrounding many of Osirion’s cities. When enemies approached, the sand golems coalesced from the nearby sand and made quick work of trespassers and potential invaders, proving a brilliant success.

 Enterprising sorcerers and wizards have come into great fortune by utilizing sand golems to collect ancient relics from hidden tombs and newly discovered ruins deep in the parched desert dunes. With their ability to withstand the blazing temperatures of the desert sun, these golems are perfect scouts and retrievers. Additionally, sand golems make for stalwart sentinels of precious locations such as a master’s lair or curious locales that require in-person research from their masters.

 Sand golems, like other constructs, obey their creators’ commands to the best of their ability. Should the creator die, or should the golem’s commands be unattainable, the sand golem goes rogue. The creature is still completely functional, but it follows no commands or orders from anyone. Over the course of time, many sand golems have gone rogue, and plenty still roam the harsh deserts of northern Garund.

 Though sand golems are usually encountered alone, particularly demanding tasks might cause their masters to send a gang of sand golems to complete the mission. A sand golem is 10 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.
