special_abilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    desc: A skinwalker can change shape to a bestial form as a standard action. In bestial form, a skinwalker gains a +2 racial bonus to his choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. While in this form, a skinwalker also takes on an animalistic feature that provides a special effect. Each time a skinwalker assumes bestial form, he can choose to gain two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage, 60 foot darkvision, or a +1 natural armor bonus. These benefits last until the skinwalker returns to his humanoid form as a swift action. A skinwalker must first return to his humanoid form before changing to bestial form again to change benefits. The skinwalker presented here is currently in bestial form, and has claw attacks and a +2 racial bonus to Strength.

# Description
Most people believe that skinwalkers are half-breeds of lycanthropes, or that they possess a weaker version of the curse of lycanthropy. However, skinwalker shamans claim that their people were chosen by the gods as a bridge between humanity and animals. Either way, skinwalkers resemble humans much of the time, but they have the uncanny ability to transform into bestial humanoids with powerful and fearsome aspects of animals.
