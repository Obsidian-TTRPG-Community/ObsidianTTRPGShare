special_abilities:
  - name: Ambush Strike (Ex)
    desc: During the surprise round, the scrapshell can use its razor-sharp tongue to gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, threaten a critical hit on a natural roll of 15-20, and automatically confirm any critical hit against a flat-footed creature.
  - name: Sticky Shell (Ex)
    desc: A scrapshell exudes a sticky mucus that causes items that come into contact with its shell to become affixed. The items stuck to a scrapshell grant it a +4 armor bonus to AC. A weapon that strikes a scrapshell becomes stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save. A creature adjacent to the scrapshell can pry off a stuck weapon with a successful DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature that becomes stuck to a scrapshell via a natural attack gains the grappled condition, but the scrapshell does not. A successful critical hit on a scrapshell not only avoids this defensive mechanism (and thus the attacker has no chance of becoming stuck to the shell) but also bypasses its damage reduction. If a scrapshell takes more than 10 points of damage from a single fire attack, its sticky mucus is burned away. A dose of universal solvent or similar fluid automatically removes a scrapshell’s sticky shell ability. It takes a scrapshell 24 hours to secrete more sticky mucus, and during this time, it does not gain the advantages of this ability, and it loses its armor bonus to AC. The shell loses its sticky quality 1 hour after the scrapshell dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    desc: A scrapshell attacks with a thin, elongated tongue tipped with a long, curved blade of shell, similar in size to a large falchion. This is a primary attack.

desc_short: This strange oysterlike mollusk has a long, thin tongue, tipped with a blade, that slides from between the shell halves.

# Description
Fiercely territorial, the scrapshell is commonly found in the waters around the Eye of Abendego and the trade routes of the Inner Sea, as well as other areas laced with sunken ships or underwater ruins. The scrapshell’s penchant for lairing in or near submerged shipwrecks and other coastal detritus and for adorning its shell with interesting (and often highly valuable) debris makes it a tempting target for scavengers of all sorts. Any treasure found in or near a scrapshell generally consists of weapons stuck to its shell or the large and uniquely colored pearls the creature produces-these dazzling and iridescent pearls are highly prized. Scrapshell mucus loses its sticky quality soon after the creature’s death. A scrapshell measures about 10 feet across and weighs 800 pounds.
