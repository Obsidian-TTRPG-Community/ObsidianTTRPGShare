special_abilities:
  - name: Solar Aura (Su)
    desc: Light levels within 60 feet of a sun giant increase by one step (supernatural darkness becomes normal darkness). This does not count as a light effect for the purpose of light and darkness effects; a solar aura is not hindered by any type of magical darkness, and its effect is applied after all light and darkness effects. In areas of bright light, a solar aura causes sighted creatures to become dazzled for as long as they remain in the aura. Once per round as a free action, a sun giant can direct light toward a single target within her solar aura, and that creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Sun Dart (Ex)
    desc: A sun giant can fire darts of light from her atlatl. She doesn’t need ammunition, the sun darts target touch AC, and the sun darts deal an additional 2d6 points of fire damage. A Large or smaller creature damaged by a sun giant’s sun dart becomes entangled and immobilized. A creature can free itself with a successful DC 24 Escape Artist or Strength check as a standard action or by breaking the sun dart (hardness 5, hp 20). The save DC is Dexterity-based.

# Description
Sun giants view themselves as soldiers in an eternal war against the forces of darkness and shadow. In ancient days, sun giants were a benevolent people, fighting for the good of all living things. Over time, the majority of sun giants have become selfish, demanding tribute and even blood sacrifices in exchange for the protection they provide, ruling by might and opposed by those few brave and benevolent souls willing to take to the shadows to fight for freedom. Many evil sun giants pay homage to demon lords of the sun and warfare.

 Sun giants hold vicious hatred for creatures of pure darkness and denizens of the Plane of Shadow, and they exterminate owbs in particular whenever possible.

 Though they live for centuries, sun giants are blessed with eternally youthful appearances, a blessing that remains even for those who become selfish and corrupt. They tower over 25 feet tall and weigh roughly 18,000 pounds.
