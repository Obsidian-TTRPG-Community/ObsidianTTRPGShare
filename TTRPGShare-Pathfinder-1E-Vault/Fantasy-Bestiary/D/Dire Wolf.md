# Description
An enormous version of a normal wolf, dire wolves represent the wolf in its most primal form. These creatures follow the same basic behaviors of regular wolves, but are much more aggressive. Dire wolves often serve giants as hunting companions and vicious guard animals. Some ferocious humanoids and woodsmen use trained dire wolves as mounts. Darker than normal wolves, dire wolvesâ€™ coats tend toward blacks and deep mottled grays. An adult dire wolf is typically about 9 feet long and weighs roughly 800 pounds.
