    desc: standard
special_abilities:
  - name: Dream Theft (Su)
    desc: While in the same space as a dreaming creature, or when touching the boundary of a dreamscape, the hag can force the dreaming creature into a lucid body and enter its dreamscape-this is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If the hag deals enough damage to kill the lucid body (despite the dreamer’s ability to perform impossible deeds), instead of the dreamer waking up harmlessly, the hag can trap the creature’s dreaming mind in her dreamstone (see below), causing its body to remain in a mindless coma indefinitely (even magic like miracle and wish can at best transport the caster to the location of the trapped mind).
  - name: Dreamstone (Su)
    desc: Every dreamthief hag carries a dreamstone-a gemstone crafted from the petrified tears of a dream dragon and worth at least 2,200 gp. The stone is psychically attuned by the hag’s spirit and proximity. If the hag dies or is no longer in possession of her stone, it remains attuned for only 24 hours. The dreamstone can hold up to 20 dreaming minds stolen by the hag. A dreamthief hag can release a stored mind, sifting out its essence, to regain 2 PE. The mind then returns to its body, but the hag’s tampering usually inflicts deep mental scars, resulting in new phobias, nervous ticks, or sleep disorders. A dreamthief hag can use her dream theft ability and etherealness only if she has her dreamstone.
  - name: Mind Block (Su)
    desc: A creature bitten by a dreamthief hag cannot cast spells or attempt Intelligence checks or Intelligence-based skill checks for 1 round. Creatures with at least 1 mythic rank are immune to this ability. This is a poison effect.

# Description
These more powerful cousins of night hags often wander the Dimension of Dreams, stealing dreaming minds, trapping them within dreamstones, and selling them to the highest bidder. While few denizens of any plane trust dreamthief hags, some welcome them as merchants. Many powerful evil beings find captured minds to be useful components in dark rituals or profane research.

Even those who hold dreamthief hags in contempt are careful not to offend them, for their bite contains a venom capable of temporarily paralyzing a victim’s mind, and the hags have few scruples about capturing even longtime commercial partners’ minds if the hags feel they have been disrespectful. While it’s difficult to determine exactly what harm befalls the minds in dreamthief hags’ care, those who have been released by them are never quite the same, and rarely have a nightmare-free night of sleep again.
