# Description
Having manipulated and assassinated her way into the middle ranks of her church, the drow priest uses her powers to eliminate rivals as she continues her climb. The drow religious orders are just as cutthroat as every other aspect of drow society. Their priests see the ability to out-scheme one’s foes as a sign of the unholy favor of their demonic patrons.
