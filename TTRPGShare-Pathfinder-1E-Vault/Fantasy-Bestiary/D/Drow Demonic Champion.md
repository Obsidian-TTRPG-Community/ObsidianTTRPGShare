# Description
A demonic champion has been tested by the powers of the Abyss and emerged stronger for it. Her soul is scarred by centuries of depraved acts, and she is irredeemable in her evil-something she is happy to prove. Demonic champions enjoy many creature comforts within drow society thanks to the spoils they claim in war, but their bloodlust motivates them to repeatedly return to battle.
