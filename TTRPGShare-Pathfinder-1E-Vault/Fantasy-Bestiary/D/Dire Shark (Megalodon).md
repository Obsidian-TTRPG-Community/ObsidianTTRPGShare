# Description
The true nightmare of the sea is the megalodon, a shark that represents the pinnacle of this species’ evolution. Horrifying in its immense size and ruinous appetite, the megalodon is certainly the beast behind many legends of enormous fish who swallow ships whole. A megalodon is 60 feet long and weighs 100,000 pounds.
