special_abilities:
  - name: Black Shards (Ex)
    desc: As a standard action, a despoiler can remove and throw a shard as a bolt of negative energy to a range of 80 feet, dealing 4d6 points of negative energy damage on a hit. A creature that takes damage from a black shard must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be staggered from the pain for 1d4 rounds. A despoiler can impale itself on a shard in this way to heal itself of 4d6 points of damage. Once a shard is used, it must be replenished via the despoilerâ€™s embrace of darkness ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Embrace of Darkness (Su)
    desc: If a despoiler pins a grappled creature, it deals 4d6 points of negative energy damage and staggers the victim for 1d3 rounds. When a despoiler uses this ability, it regrows a black shard (to a maximum of 3 black shards). A successful DC 19 Will save halves the damage and prevents the staggered condition and shard regrowth. The save DC is Charisma-based.
