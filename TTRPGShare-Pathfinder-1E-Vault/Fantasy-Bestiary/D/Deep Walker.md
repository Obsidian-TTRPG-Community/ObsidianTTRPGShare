# Description
Deep walkers are among the largest creatures bred by the aboleths. A deepwalker weighs around 10 tons, and when reared up to its full height, itâ€™s 35 feet tall. 

Deep walkers prefer to feed on blood, especially that of intelligent creatures. While they can at times be encountered alone in the ocean wilds, they are most common in realms controlled by aboleths, where they serve as guardians for these mysterious underwater enclaves or as devastating amphibious assault forces against coastal targets. Those few that have managed to escape direct aboleth control remain vile and cruel sadists, and they often rule over their own petty kingdoms of lesser creatures that they can torment and consume.
