  - name: Cunning Initiative (Ex)
    desc: An inquisitor troop adds its Wisdom bonus to its initiative checks.
  - name: Judgment of Protection (Su)
    desc: An inquisitor troop gains a +1 profane bonus to its armor class.
  - name: Fast Healing (Sp)
    desc: An inquisitor troopâ€™s fast healing is a reflection of the fact that each round, some of the inquisitors in the troop cast cure light wounds spells on wounded members. Not all inquisitors in a troop use this ability simultaneously, and they can only grant fast healing to the troop for up to 10 rounds per day. Activating this ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
  - name: Protect Ally (Ex)
    desc: See dottari troop above.

# Description
House Thrune and the Church of Asmodeus can mobilize special groups of dottari and inquisitors known as troops. Typically, a troop is placed under the command of a captain or priest who does not function as part of the troop.
