  - name: Lingering Curses (Su)
    desc: An indarugant is an accursed creature, and so has dominion over misfortune and curses. An indarugant can apply the effects of its curse of frozen flesh with its bestow curse spell-like ability (in place of bestow curse’s normal effects). Additionally, the DC of any attempt to remove a curse inflicted by the indarugant increases by 5. If a caster level check to remove an indarugant’s curse fails by 5 or more, the curse appears to be lifted and is temporarily suppressed until the next time the victim enters combat or is otherwise faced with a life-threatening situation (subject to the GM’s discretion).

# Description
In times of need, the taiga giants of Varisia turn to the spirits of their ancestors for aid, relying on signs and omens from the spirit world to guide them out of danger. Yet sometimes the power and insight of these ancestral spirits is not enough. When invaders overhunt the land, when disease and pestilence run rampant, or when war and slavery threaten to decimate whole tribes, some giants seek a different sort of aid-one that comes at a far higher price. High above the snow line, trapped within ancient glacial floes, the indarugants wait to be unleashed so they might once again bring disaster and ruin to the enemies of their tribes.

Most indarugants resemble the desiccated corpses of taiga giants, though other types of giants may become indarugants as well. After taiga giants, stone giants are the most likely to follow through with this ritual, though by doing so they risk being shunned by neighboring tribes.

Indarugants stand 20 feet tall, but weigh only 3,000 pounds due to the lack of water in their shriveled, skeletal bodies. The ritual that creates an indarugant involves marking and maiming the body of the candidate, and many still bear these fading tattoos and ancient scars.
