special_abilities:
  - name: Bloody Icicles (Su)
    desc: Inkariax can use the icicles embedded in his flesh as melee or thrown ranged weapons. He can retrieve up to four of these icicles per round as a swift action. When wielded as a melee weapon, an icicle is considered a +5 wounding rapier. When wielded as thrown ranged weapons, the icicles are considered +3 daggers. Icicles Inkariax retrieves from his flesh are immediately replaced, and he has hundreds of icicles embedded in his flesh that he can use for this purpose.
  - name: Cloak of Ice (Su)
    desc: Inkariax is immune to cold damage as well as spells with the cold descriptor, and he always treats any difficult terrain that results from magical or mundane ice as normal terrain. He gains a profane bonus to his Armor Class equal to his Intelligence bonus.
  - name: Freezing Blast (Su)
    desc: Inkariax can harness the power of absolute zero and release it in a burst around him with but a thought. Inkariax can use this ability five times per day as a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. When he does, creatures within 30 feet of him take 6d6 points of cold damage and 6d6 points of piercing damage that counts as evil and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. A successful DC 29 Fortitude saving throw halves both the cold and piercing damage. Additionally, creatures that fail this save must immediately attempt a DC 29 Will save. Failing this second save means a creature has been frozen solid and has become a supernaturally frozen, mindless, inert statue and is considered petrified, per flesh to stone (if the creature isn’t made of flesh, this secondary ability has no effect). The creature can’t be turned back to flesh by casting stone to flesh, but it can be restored via break enchantment. If the creature is not restored after a number of hours equal to the creature’s Hit Dice, the creature dies and remains a perpetually frozen statue; it can’t be returned to life except by the express intervention of a deity. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Icy Logic (Su)
    desc: Inkariax has absolute, logical control over the essence of cold. The save DCs for his spell-like abilities are based on his Intelligence rather than his Charisma. Additionally, at will, he can dispel any ongoing effect with the cold descriptor. This functions as greater dispel magic, although Inkariax automatically succeeds at any required dispel checks.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Ex)
    desc: A creature that succumbs to Inkariax’s unnerving gaze becomes stunned for 1d4 rounds as it becomes convinced that the demagogue’s bloody icicles are working their way through its body, slowly transforming it into a frozen, blood-soaked exhibit in Inkariax’s menagerie.

# Description
The kyton demagogue known as the White Death is an ancient, mysterious, and aloof figure who dwells on the Plane of Shadow and is cloaked in the flesh-piercing bloody icicles, some of which stitch his mouth closed. For millennia he has lurked in his realm of Frozen Tears, located atop a thick sheet of shadowy ice over a frigid sea.

 Inkariax sprang fully formed from the plane’s essence eons ago, terrible in his perfection, with flesh sculpted of ice and unadulterated, if surprisingly refined, sadism. The demagogue spent untold ages wandering the cosmos looking for the perfect place to keep his collection of wickedly preserved innocents, leaving carnage and abandoned menageries of victims along the way. When he finally happened upon the wastes that would become the Frozen Tears, Inkariax felt a surging empathic link with Doloras, the Queen of the Night of dispassion, whom he believed freed the entire kyton species from Hell. He then began constructing an elaborate and terrible citadel and surrounding realm from the sheer evil of the landscape before him. The screams of the first victims of Inkariax and his kytons are said to be woven into the realm’s fabric in such a way as to drive any creature fool enough to stumble upon them to heinous thought and deeds.

 Shortly after he claimed the territory, the Queen of the Night appeared unbidden in Inkariax’s nascent realm. She spoke not a word to Inkariax, whose lost voice is said to be so horrific that its throaty growl could end civilizations. Instead, she merely gave him a wan glance and gifted him tears harvested from her diadem-her symbol of power. These gifts Inkariax turned into the pendants of the first tears. Doloras wordlessly left that day, but ever since, Inkariax has seen her as the perfect, like-minded ally, and he has spent millennia attempting to again catch her attention with monuments and havens for her worshippers in his realm. It is unclear whether Doloras is testing the demagogue, playing a long game to destroy him, or merely taking her time to ally with him, but the unholy churches of Inkariax and her worshippers are tightly connected.

 Inkariax himself is a cosmic mystery, even beyond his would-be alliance with the Queen of the Night. He never speaks, cares nothing of mortals, and is rarely seen outside his palace, called White Death’s Diadem. However, the demagogue can take the form of his favored servants, libitinarii kytons at any time, and he roams the planes in this guise to further his plans. All libitinarii kytons receive particular respect from canny outsiders, as none know whether one of the grim fiends is actually Inkariax in disguise. The demagogue’s isolation and the regimented nature of his realm are also attractive to devils and other expatriates from Hell who crave order but appreciate Inkariax’s aloofness. Some say that Inkariax is secretly building an army of such devils to present to Doloras as a gift should she ever return to his realm. It’s more likely, though, that the demagogue is simply focused on building his horrific menageries of mutilated goodly creatures, turning his realm into the ultimate macabre museum of torturous preservation- which might also one day win him the Queen of Night’s true attention. 

Inkariax is an enormous humanoid, towering 70 feet high and crusted with ice. Bloody icicles pierce his skin in many places, particularly through his lips, stitching his mouth shut. Inkariax never speaks, but his expressive gaze is sufficient to communicate his curiosity or displeasure. Troubled by the impermanence of perfection, Inkariax seeks to preserve works of horrific art-whether ideal screams, exquisite tortures, or perfect examples of sadistic brutality-by sealing them in ice forever. Inkariax’s control over ice and snow is absolute, and he can freeze a victim into a solid block of ice with only a thought.

 Frozen Tears, the demagogue’s realm, lies in the Shadow Plane atop a frozen sea and blanketed by an icy blizzard of razor-sharp crystals. The heart of his realm, White Death’s Diadem, holds his greatest treasures and most powerful minions. Its upper reaches, however, are reserved only for the demagogue himself and for his greatest horrors, which he has preserved for all time.

 Inkariax has a long-standing connection to the infernal demigoddess Doloras, even beyond the debt all velstracs owe to her for setting them free from Hell. Doloras visited Inkariax before he built his realm, and the demagogue named it for Doloras’s gift of frozen tears from her crown. Indeed, Inkariax built much of his realm in honor of the demigoddess, and he strives to earn her further favor.
