# Description
Giant isopods are carnivorous scavengers that scour the ocean’s floor. They vaguely resemble the common wood louse in appearance, though they can grow to be up to 2-1/2 feet long and weigh nearly 4 pounds. Their unusual size and insectile appearance cause many humanoids to be wary of them, despite their relative harmlessness.
