# Description
Deadly greensting scorpions normally live in forests, though they can survive nearly anywhere.

A greensting scorpion familiar grants a +4 bonus on Initiative checks so long as the familiar is within 1 mile of the spellcaster. A greensting scorpion familiar loses the mindless trait and has an Intelligence score appropriate for its master’s level.
