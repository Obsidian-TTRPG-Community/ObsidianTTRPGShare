  - name: Treasure
    desc: triple (+5 arrow deflection bashing heavy steel shield, +5 cruel dispelling burst unholy flail, Horn of Lies, other treasure)
special_abilities:
  - name: Casterbane (Ex)
    desc: Geryon’s foresight allows it to counterspell using greater dispel magic as an immediate action, with a +4 bonus to counter or dispel divine spells. It gains Spellbreaker as a bonus feat, and a spellcaster who fails a concentration check to cast defensively become flat-footed to Geryon until the end of its next turn.
  - name: Corrupting Caress (Su)
    desc: A creature damaged by Geryon’s natural attacks or melee weapons becomes unable to cast divine spells or activate domain powers, channel positive energy, or smite evil for 1 round (Will DC 38 negates). The duration stacks with multiple failed saves, but a creature that successfully saves cannot be further targeted by Geryon’s corrupting caress for 24 hours. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Envenomed Scales (Ex)
    desc: Creatures that strike Geryon with melee touch attacks, unarmed strikes, or natural attacks are exposed to its poison, as are creatures that confirm a critical hit on Geryon with a piercing or slashing weapon in melee.
  - name: Immune to Memory Loss (Ex)
    desc: Geryon is immune to the effects of the River Styx and to all effects that cause memory loss or manipulate memories.
  - name: Perceive Destiny (Su)
    desc: As an immediate action, Geryon can train its threefold gaze upon a creature to perceive its past, present, and future, granting Geryon a +4 insight bonus to its AC and on attack rolls, opposed skill checks, and Reflex saves against that creature and attacks or effects created by that creature until the end of its next turn. This affects creatures using mind blank, nondetection, or similar protection from divination only if Geryon succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + the effect’s caster level + the mythic tier of the caster, for mythic effects).
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Tail slap-injury; save Fort DC 43; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Int drain; cure 3 saves.
  - name: Threefold Body (Ex)
    desc: Geryon’s vital organs and senses are spread across all three of its linked bodies. An effect that would cause it to become blinded or deafened instead affects only one of its bodies, unless it affects an area or targets each body as a separate creature. If one body is blinded or deafened, Geryon suffers no ill effects. If two bodies are blinded or deafened, it loses its all-around vision and is dazzled. Geryon is blinded or deafened only if all three bodies are blinded or deafened. It likewise has a 75% chance to ignore critical hits, sneak attack damage, and similar precision-based damage.

# Description
Geryon, the source of blasphemies, has ruled in Hell longer than any other archdevil. When Asmodeus and his legions migrated to Hell, Geryon reigned as an asura rana, an emperor among divine mistakes. After bargaining with Asmodeus, Geryon betrayed its brethren, assuring devilkind’s stranglehold over Hell and cementing its continued rule over the bleak marshes of Stygia. Ever since, Geryon has numbered among Hell’s greatest and most enigmatic rulers, a connoisseur of impossible truths and a font of heresies. 

Geryon is a knot of three 20-foot-long, scaled worms. From its maws it can partially regurgitate and speak with the voices of any being it has ever devoured-be they mortals, fiends, or stranger eldritch beings. As a result of its covenant with Asmodeus, Geryon is now a true devil.
