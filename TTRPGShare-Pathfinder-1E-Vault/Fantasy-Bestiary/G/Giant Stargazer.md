special_abilities:
  - name: Gulp (Ex)
    desc: A stargazer can open its giant mouth in a fraction of a second, creating a vortex that draws a target into its maw. When underwater, a stargazer gains 5 additional feet of reach with its bite attack and a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    desc: Venomous spines-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect sickened for 1d4 rounds; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Shock (Ex)
    desc: A stargazer delivers an electrical shock with each successful bite attack, dealing an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage.
  - name: Venomous Spines (Ex)
    desc: A stargazer has two large venomous spines situated behind its head. The stargazer reacts swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature that attempts to harm it. Each time a creature attacks a stargazer with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or weapon attack that doesn't have reach, it must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or be hit by one of these spines. Each time a creature is hit by a spine, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the stargazer's poison. A creature that grapples a stargazer is automatically hit by these spines. The save DC to avoid the spines is Dexterity-based.
