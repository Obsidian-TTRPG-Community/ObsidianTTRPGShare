special_abilities:
  - name: Doll’s Dagger (Su)
    desc: The dagger wielded by a guardian doll is treated as a masterwork weapon and delivers 1d6 points of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. Those struck by the dagger must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed by the supernatural cold of the weapon for 1d4 rounds. If the guardian doll is destroyed, its weapon becomes a useless child’s toy. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    desc: The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll or its apparel, typically one of the doll’s eyes or a gem embedded into its neck or chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn. If it is put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.
  - name: Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex)
    desc: Like a soulbound doll, a guardian doll is susceptible to mind-affecting effects. However, due to the singular purpose with which it is imbued, its saves against such effects are made with a +1 racial bonus.

# Description
Guardian dolls are constructs created by the White Witches to serve as spies and sentries at places that require evervigilant wardens-especially the wintry nation’s borders. Similar to soulbound dolls (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 255), these strange automatons are infused with fragments of the souls of living beings slain during the dolls’ creation. The doll is sentient, and though a small part of the soul’s original personality remains, the witchery employed largely strips it of its individuality. Many guardian dolls sit inside another form of construct-a sentinel hut- and stand vigil at one of Irrisen’s borders and monitoring those who would enter. Others are sent on scouting missions or to spy on targets, usually posing as inanimate dolls to hide their true nature.
