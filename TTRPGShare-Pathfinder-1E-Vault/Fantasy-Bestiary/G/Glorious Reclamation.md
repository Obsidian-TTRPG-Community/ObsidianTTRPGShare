# Description
This represents an average troop of Glorious Reclamation sergeants active around Westcrown and Citadel Rivad. Although most of the individual soldiers in the troop are skilled fighters, the troop contains a sufficient number of clerics to provide the troop with limited healing. These troops are normally outfitted with longswords, full plate armor, and tower shields.
