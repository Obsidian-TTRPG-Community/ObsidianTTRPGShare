# Description
Some ravens can reach astonishing sizes, making them a threat to foxes, raccoons, and on occasion even larger animals. Like their smaller cousins, giant ravens are omnivorous, able to subsist on nearly anything, though they favor large insects, small mammals, and other birds. They are also consummate scavengers, often feeding on the remains of creatures left behind by larger predators. These large corvids share the keen and vengeful intellect of smaller ravens. 

Giant ravens grow to be nearly 5 feet in height and weigh 45 pounds.
