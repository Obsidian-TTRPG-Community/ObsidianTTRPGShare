# Description
A troop of goblins is a frenzied mass of gnashing teeth, thrashing limbs, and wildly swinging knives. Goblins in a troop gain bravery in numbers and eagerly assault creatures they should have no business attacking. Horses and dogs are particularly hated targets and, if present, generally endure the brunt of the goblin troop’s attention.
