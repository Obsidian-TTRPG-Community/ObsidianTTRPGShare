special_abilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    desc: Each of a gorynych’s heads has its own separate breath weapon. When a gorynych uses its breath weapon, it can breathe with one, two, or all three heads. If the areas of two or more breath weapons overlap, a creature caught in that overlapping area takes a -2 penalty on its Reflex save (or -4 if three breath weapons overlap). Damage done by overlapping breath weapons stacks and is considered to be a single source of fire damage for the purpose of tracking fire resistance. Regardless of how many heads breathe fire, the gorynych can only use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Multi-Headed (Ex)
    desc: All three of a gorynych’s heads can act independently of each other. When it makes a full attack, each head can either bite or use its breath weapon, in any combination (two bites and one breath, three breaths and no bites, and so on).

# Description
This sinister beast threatens entire countrysides with its plundering actions. No friend to its true dragon cousins, a gorynych sometimes threatens green and black dragons for mastery of their lands. A gorynych seeks out young dragons that have only established small hoards, killing the rival creatures and claiming their treasures as its own. It dominates drakes and wyverns, but true dragons consider it a repulsive throwback to an ancient line of mutants and deviants.

Motivated by greed, gluttony, and unnatural lust, a gorynych lives to collect treasure, feast as often as possible, and chase after humanoid maidens, using alter self and charm person as necessary. Gorynyches are particularly creative with the use of their limited wishes in duplicating other spell effects to secure their desires and complete their hideous tasks.

When not busily stalking young dragons in order to steal their hoard or selecting maidens to kidnap, most gorynyches search out ancient ruins. There they install themselves as guardians, sometimes even gathering whole tribes of monstrous humanoids to act as their servants.
