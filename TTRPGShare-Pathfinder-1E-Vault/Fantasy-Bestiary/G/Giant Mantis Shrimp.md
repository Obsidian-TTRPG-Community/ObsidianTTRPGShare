# Description
Organization solitary
Treasure noneSpecial AbilitiesIncredible Sight (Ex) A giant mantis shrimp’s eyes pick up colors well beyond those visible to humans, and it can see perfectly in all light conditions, including supernatural darkness. As long as the giant mantis shrimp is not blinded, it is treated as having blindsight 60 feet.
 Sonic Burst (Ex) A giant mantis shrimp attacks with such extreme speed that its pincers issue a concussive blast of light and force when they snap closed. Each time a giant mantis shrimp makes a pincer attack, whether it hits or misses, each creature in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on the attack’s target takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or be stunned for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to the stun effect from additional sonic bursts from that giant mantis shrimp until the vermin’s next turn, but it still takes sonic damage from additional sonic bursts. The giant mantis shrimp is immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
 Speedy Pincers (Ex) A giant mantis shrimp can make iterative attacks with one pincer.DescriptionThough the colorful shells of giant mantis shrimp are beautiful to behold, the sight of one often means death. These apex predators prowl tide pools and coastal shallows, competing for territory with karkinoi and shark eater crabs.

 A typical giant mantis shrimp grows to 4 feet high and 6 feet long, and weighs around 200 pounds.
