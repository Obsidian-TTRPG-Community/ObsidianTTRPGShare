    desc: When a giant frilled lizard charges, it hisses ferociously, extends its neck frills, and darts forward on its hind legs, increasing its base speed to 50 feet for that round. In addition to the normal effects of a charge, the creature charged must make a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds. This is a fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

desc_short: This bright-eyed lizard is larger than a horse. As it hisses in anger, a brightly colored frill extends around its neck.

# Description
This lizard is a true behemoth-an apex predator found in tropical regions. Many species of giant lizard exist-other species lack this lizardâ€™s intimidating charge special ability but might have other special attacks like grab, trip, constrict (with a bite), or pounce.
