    desc: When a mimic ooze makes a successful grapple combat maneuver check, it can flow over a Small, Medium, or Large creature, covering it like a second skin. At the beginning of every turn the creature remains enshrouded, it takes 6d6 points of acid damage and 1 point of Charisma damage as the mimic ooze absorbs it. The mimic ooze uses the AC and saving throw bonuses of the enshrouded creature for attacks and effects that deal hit point damage, but the enshrouded creature can choose to not avoid an attack or an effect. Damage dealt to the mimic ooze is divided between it and the creature it’s enshrouding, and vice versa. While the mimic ooze is enshrouding a creature, it can’t take any actions other than to release the creature as a move action. If a freedom of movement spell is cast on the enshrouded creature, the creature is no longer enshrouded and the mimic ooze falls off and reforms in an adjacent unoccupied space.
  - name: Floating (Ex)
    desc: A mimic ooze can tread on liquid as if it were firm ground.
  - name: Hypnotic Flow (Su)
    desc: The body of a mimic ooze can move and flow in a peculiar mixture of familiar and alien motions. A creature within 30 feet of it becomes fascinated for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 18 negates). Once a creature succeeds at a save against the fascination effect, it remains immune to this ability for 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Pool (Ex)
    desc: A mimic ooze can release its humanoid form, emulating a pool of dark liquid. An observer must succeed at a DC 25 Perception check to notice the unnatural flow of the pool. If the mimic ooze initiates combat from this state, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.

desc_short: The body of this humanoid-shaped ooze is composed of an oily, black liquid. Its body ripples as it moves, and tendrils of hair flow around its expressionless face.

# Description
Mimic oozes consist of deep-black liquid that has taken on a humanoid form. The liquid dissolves organic matter rapidly, which can pose a serious threat to any creatures that come into contact with it.

 Not only can these mimic oozes learn the behavior of other creatures, but they can even imitate it as well. If a mimic ooze comes into contact with a creature physically, it envelops and consumes that victim, leaving behind nothing but a clean skeleton and any durable gear that the creature was carrying. As a mimic ooze absorbs a victim, it takes on some echoes of its mannerisms and thoughts as well as the target’s outward features, which contribute to the ooze’s primitive, chaotic mind. These jumbled shadows of thought fall second to the impulse that mimic oozes have to devour sentient humanoids.

 Mimic oozes either stalk creatures they notice nearby, waiting for a chance to close the distance between them, or lie in wait for their prey to come near. Once a mimic ooze has enshrouded a creature, it doesn’t release its victim unless forced to do so. It’s rumored that more advanced mimic oozes have been able to form more coherent minds, though these are still alien in their function and purpose.
