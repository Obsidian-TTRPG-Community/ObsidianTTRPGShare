special_abilities:
  - name: Brutal Surge (Su)
    desc: When Grendel expends mythic power to add a surge die to an attack roll, he also adds a surge die to that attack’s damage roll. This is not an action and does not require him to expend any additional uses of mythic power to use this ability.
  - name: Gruesome Dismemberment (Ex)
    desc: When Grendel successfully holds a creature he has grappled, he may expend one use of mythic power to attempt to dismember that creature. He attempts a grapple check; if successful, his target takes double his normal claw damage and the attack pulls off one of the target’s legs or arms. The target is sickened until it receives magical healing (or until it recovers to full hit points by natural means), and takes 2d6 points of bleed damage each round. A creature with only one an arm cannot perform actions requiring two arms or two hands. A bipedal creature with one leg missing cannot walk or run; it can crawl or hop, but is denied its Dexterity bonus against all opponents. A quadrupedal creature with one leg missing is reduced to half normal speed. At the GM’s discretion, creatures with more than four legs affected by this attack may be able to move at normal speed.

# Description
This reaver of the cold marsh is not just a monster; he is a force of nature. Where there is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility is transitory and death is the only constant. Grendel stalks the edge of his fens looking for quiet settlements. Under cover of night, he strikes, murdering the strong in their beds and chasing the terrified with demonic glee. He then takes the prize of his carnage deep into his fen where his lust for blood is grotesquely sated.
