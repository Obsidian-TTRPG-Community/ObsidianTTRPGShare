    desc: standard (+2 frost spear, other treasure)
special_abilities:
  - name: Cold Logic (Su)
    desc: When a mythic ice devil’s spell resistance protects it from a mind-affecting effect, it can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to turn that effect upon its source, as if using spell turning.
  - name: Favored Enemy (Ex)
    desc: A mythic ice devil can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +6 favored enemy bonus against one type of creature for 1 hour, as if it were a 14th-level ranger.
  - name: Ice Burrowing (Ex)
    desc: This ability works like the burrow ability, but only through ice and snow (including magical ice such as a wall of ice).
  - name: Ice Shards (Su)
    desc: A mythic ice devil’s ice-tipped spear embeds jagged shards of supernaturally cold ice in its target. This functions as bleed (1d6), except the damage is cold damage. Dealing 5 or more points of fire damage to the target removes all ice shards. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this ability.
  - name: Slow (Su)
    desc: A hit from a mythic ice devil’s tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds. This effect comes from the devil, not its weapon; it is not a quality possessed by the spear itself. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
A mythic ice devil is a master of strategy, able to adapt to the nature of its opponents and turn its enemy’s attacks back at them. Its lean form and upright posture sets it apart from the stockier non-mythic ice devils.
