  - name: Poison Weapons (Ex)
    desc: A mythic medusa can spend a standard action to apply her snake poison to her sword or to two arrows, and normally poisons her weapons in advance.
  - name: Summon Snake (Sp)
    desc: As a full-round action, a mythic medusa can summon an emperor cobra (Bestiary 2 252) or 1d3 amphisbaenas (Bestiary 2 25) as if using a summon monster spell. The summoned snakes are immune to the medusa’s gaze attack and remain for 8 rounds before disappearing.
  - name: Unpetrify (Su)
    desc: A mythic medusa can expend one use of mythic power to return a petrified creature to life (as if using stone to flesh) for 1 minute. The creature is under the medusa’s control (as if using dominate monster) and reverts to a statue at the end of this time. If the medusa expends three uses of mythic power, the creature remains unpetrified for 24 hours instead of 1 minute. A typical petrified victim in a mythic medusa’s lair is a half-elf fighter 6 (Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex 82) or human warrior 6 (NPC Codex 268).

# Description
A mythic medusa is one of the near-immortal progenitors of the medusa race, who mate with humanoids in order to produce weaker (but still deadly) offspring. With deadly poison, power over snakes, and the ability to animate and command those she has turned to stone, a mythic medusa is a dangerous foe who can’t be easily overcome by mirrored shields and blindfolds; she waits, strikes, and retreats, allowing her minions and venom to weaken her foes before she is ready to take their lives.
