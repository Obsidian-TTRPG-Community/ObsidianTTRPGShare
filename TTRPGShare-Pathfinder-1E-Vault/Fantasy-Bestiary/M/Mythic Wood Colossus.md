    desc: As a full-round action, a wood colossus can transform into a manor house. Each time it does so, it can choose a different internal architecture to suit its master’s needs. The wood colossus can include any kind of wooden furniture in its rooms (including chairs, work benches, and the like), but can’t create any objects not made out of wood. Any objects that were in the manor house when the colossus last transformed into its true form are present unless the colossus chose to expel them. The manor house can comfortably house up to 10 Medium creatures; when the colossus reverts to its true form, these creatures are expelled without taking damage. While in this form, the colossus can’t make melee attacks but can use telekinesis at will on wooden objects inside of it.
