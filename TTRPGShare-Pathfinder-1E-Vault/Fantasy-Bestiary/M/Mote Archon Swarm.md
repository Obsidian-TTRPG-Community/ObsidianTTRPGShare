special_abilities:

    desc: A mote archon swarm can choose not to deal swarm damage to any creature sharing its space and can choose not to impede the spellcasting or concentration of a creature sharing its space.
  - name: Superlative Healer (Su)
    desc: A mote archon swarm can use the Heal skill to provide first aid, treat a wound, or treat poison as a swift action; to treat a disease as a move action; and to treat a deadly wound as a full-round action. Creatures to be treated must share the mote archon swarm’s space, but the mote archon swarm can treat any number of creatures within its space with the same action. A mote archon swarm does not require a healer’s kit to treat deadly wounds.
  - name: Vibrating Combustion (Ex)
    desc: As a swift action, a mote archon swarm can vibrate rapidly for 1 round, heating the air and dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 26 half) in addition to swarm damage at the end of its turn. Creatures that begin their turns in the swarm’s area risk catching on fire (see page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). A creature that succeeds at its save against this ability is immune to catching on fire at the start of its next turn. A burning creature can’t attempt to extinguish itself as long as it is in the mote archon swarm’s space. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Mote archons are tiny, floating runes less than an inch across. Individually, they are benign and nearly mindless creatures, but mote archons are virtually never found alone, congregating naturally in groups of hundreds or thousands of their kind. Together, these swarms of mote archons have a unified personality and an overwhelming drive to comfort the sick and heal the injured. They are most often found on the battlefields of Heaven tending to injured angels and other archons, and never hesitating to defend creatures under their care. Angry mote archons oscillate rapidly until they ignite and swarm over enemies with fiery retribution.

A mote archon swarm has no appreciable weight.
