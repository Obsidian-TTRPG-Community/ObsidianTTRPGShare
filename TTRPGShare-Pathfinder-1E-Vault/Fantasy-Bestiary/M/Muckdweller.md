# Description
Muckdwellers have long tails that allow them to swim rapidly through the water or maintain their balance when standing upright. They sometimes associate with lizardfolk, forming allied settlements, but rarely living in the same community. Still they work and hunt together for mutual benefit. Most muck dwellers stand 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 70 pounds.
