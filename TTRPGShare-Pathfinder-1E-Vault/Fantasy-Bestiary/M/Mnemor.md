    desc: A mnemor devil’s appearance and presence are difficult to fix in one’s mind. Once a mnemor devil moves out of line of sight of a creature (or otherwise becomes unseen), that creature must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be unable recall the last known location or direction of the devil. Such a creature cannot recall the details or nature of their encounter with the devil, though it retains a vague recollection that the encounter occurred. The mnemor can choose to suppress this ability.
  - name: Memory Siphon (Sp)
    desc: A creature struck by a mnemor devil’s proboscis suffers the effect of the memory lapseAPG spell with no saving throw. Additionally, the mnemor devil can choose to attempt to affect the creature as with the repress memoryOA spell (DC 16 Will save negates)-the spell targets the creature struck, rather than the mnemor devil itself, and spell resistance applies. If the target is a willing creature, the mnemor devil may alter memories of any length, as if through multiple applications of repress memoryOA.

# Description
Some memories are too traumatic to bear; some secrets are too dangerous to keep. When mortals need their memories stripped away, their desperation sometimes drives them to seek out the aid of mnemor devils, creatures that steal and bestow memories in the service of their infernal lords. While memory devils always keep their bargains, those who anger them may find that their altered memories cause more trouble than the originals. Mnemor devils are particularly skilled in the subtle manipulation of memory to drive mortals’ actions in destructive directions or even trick them into making the same bargain again and again as the mortal unearths the unbearable secret on her own, paying the devil each time. The most skilled among them subtly alter the false memories they grant to those who would bargain with them in ways that cast the subjects’ true memories in a different light, making memories of affectionate smiles seem to take on smirking undertones, or adding sly malice to memories of innocent comments. The bargainer finds himself driven into maddening doubt about the intentions of everyone he thought he knew, suspicion tainting all his interactions.

Mnemor devils themselves possess eidetic memories, and can recall with perfect clarity any memory they have bought or stolen from a mortal, making them valuable repositories of eclectic knowledge. Those seeking such knowledge might be tempted to seek a deal of their own, and mnemor devils are more than happy to trade one memory for another-though those who strike such bargains find that the mnemor devil nearly always comes out ahead.

A mnemor devil stands approximately 6 feet tall and weighs 170 pounds.
