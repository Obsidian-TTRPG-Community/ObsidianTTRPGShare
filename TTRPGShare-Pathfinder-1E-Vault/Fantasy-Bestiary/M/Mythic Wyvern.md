    desc: A mythic wyvern can expend one use of mythic power to withdraw as a move action (instead of a full-round action), moving up to its speed instead of double. It can even move straight up. If itâ€™s grappling a creature, the wyvern can bring the grappled creature with it. Usually a wyvern uses this ability to carry off its prey and drop it from above onto a hard surface. Since this is a move action, the wyvern can damage its target, withdraw, and drop its target all in the same round.

# Description
A mythic wyvern has one or more true dragons in its recent ancestry, making it strong and resilient. Despite its greater power and ego, it is more inclined to accept a rider than other wyverns, perhaps because it recognizes the value of an alliance.
