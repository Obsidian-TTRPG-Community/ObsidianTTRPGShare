special_abilities:
  - name: Apocalyptic Wound (Su)
    desc: When an ophiotaurus takes damage, it can expend one use of its mythic power as an immediate action to inundate its attacker’s mind with dire prophetic visions for 2d6 rounds (DC 27 Will negates). These visions cause the attacker to become dazzled and to take a 20% miss chance on all its attacks. An affected creature must successfully save again each round or become confused, dazed, or frightened (equal chance of each) for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting divination effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Confounding Coils (Su)
    desc: Mythic creatures grappled by an ophiotaurus must succeed at a DC 21 Will save each round or be affected as if by mythic severance. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Drag Along (Ex)
    desc: An ophiotaurus grappling Medium or smaller creatures does not gain the grappled condition, it can maintain its grapple as a free action (though if it does, it can’t attempt any additional checks to maintain the grapple that round), and it can move itself and its target at full speed without making additional grapple checks.
  - name: Questing Beast (Su)
    desc: Up to five creatures can feast upon a slain ophiotaurus’s entrails. Each such creature is exposed to nightmare vapor poison (DC 27), but also gains one of the following spell effects of her choice: discern location, divination, find the path, greater scrying (DC 21), moment of prescience, or vision (CL 15th). In addition, she may choose to accept a geas/quest to slay a specific mythic creature or creature of CR 20 or greater, gaining the effect of vengeful outrage when in combat with that opponent. Eating the entrails of a living ophiotaurus exposes the eater to the poison without any benefit. The save DC against the poison is Constitution-based, and the save DC against the spell effects is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Thundering Trample (Ex)
    desc: An ophiotaurus can expend one use of its mythic power when using its trample attack to make a single combat maneuver check and apply the result as a bull rush maneuver against the CMD of each creature that fails to save against its trample. These combat maneuvers do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
