special_abilities:
  - name: Alternate Form (Ex)
    desc: As a full-round action, a sphinx colossus can take the form of a sphinx statue. The colossus becomes immobile, its DR increases to 20/epic, and it gains fast healing 10. While the sphinx colossus canâ€™t attack in this form, it can use its spell-like and supernatural abilities, and it retains its Dexterity bonus to AC. It can resume its base form as a full-round action.
  - name: Create Rocks (Ex)
    desc: As a move action, a sphinx colossus can scoop up earth or rubble from an unoccupied square within its reach and compact it into a solid mass appropriate for use with its rock throwing ability. When it does so, the square from which the material is gathered becomes difficult terrain. No square may be used in this fashion more than once.

    desc: Spells and abilities of the divination school are unaffected by this aura.
