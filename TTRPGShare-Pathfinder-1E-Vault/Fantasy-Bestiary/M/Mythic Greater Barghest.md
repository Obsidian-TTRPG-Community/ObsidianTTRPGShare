# Description
A mythic greater barghest is a near-divine offspring of one of the barghest gods. Infused with the power of foul planes, it leads great tribes of goblins, scaring their minions into something approaching discipline. Its presence is enough for hobgoblins and bugbears to treat goblins almost as equals, having seen the barghest’s wrath at disobedience and infighting.
