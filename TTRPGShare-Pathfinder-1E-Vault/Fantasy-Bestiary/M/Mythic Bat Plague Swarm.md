special_abilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    desc: A humanoid creature who dies from a bat plague swarm’s soul bleed ability rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the swarm, and remains enslaved until the swarm is destroyed. The swarm can have enslaved spawn whose Hit Dice total no more than twice its own; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead.
  - name: Profane Protection (Su)
    desc: A bat plague swarm gains a +2 profane bonus to its Armor Class from its divine creator.
  - name: Reform (Su)
    desc: A bat plague swarm is truly destroyed only if it is dispersed in the area of a hallow spell.
  - name: Soul Bleed (Su)
    desc: A creature that takes damage from a bat plague swarm begins to bleed from its body and its soul. Each round, a creature under the effects of soul bleed takes 1d4 points of Constitution bleed damage and gains 1 negative level. A creature affected by soul bleed can’t be healed by magical healing from a non-mythic source. A mythic caster can attempt a DC 24 caster level check to heal a creature under the effects of soul bleed. If the caster succeeds, the soul bleed ends. Otherwise, any creature can end a soul bleed effect with a successful DC 35 Heal check. Twenty-four hours after a creature takes negative levels from soul bleed, it must attempt a separate DC 26 Fortitude save for each negative level. If it succeeds at a save, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent. The save DC is Constitution-based.
