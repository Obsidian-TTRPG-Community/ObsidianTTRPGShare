special_abilities:
  - name: Ashen Essence (Ex)
    desc: Despite his appearance, Mephistopheles has a body formed of the ashes and brimstone of Hell rather than flesh and blood. He cannot be blinded, dazzled, or deafened, and he is immune to bleed damage, blood drain, critical hits, and precision-based damage. In addition, once per minute when he is hit by a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action Mephistopheles can cause his body and all of his gear to collapse into ashes while he teleports to any point within 30 feet of his prior position and re-forms, taking no damage from the attack. Within his realm of Caina, he can trigger this power by expending one use of his mythic power and can teleport up to 300 feet, or up to 30 feet even when subject to effects that normally prevent teleportation.
  - name: Flattering Inquisitor (Su)
    desc: Mephistopheles is unsurpassed at inveigling himself into a creature’s good graces and ferreting out secrets. His discern lies spell-like ability automatically affects all creatures within 30 feet of him, and he does not need to concentrate to know whether a target is lying (although each time a creature tries to lie in this area it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect as normal). Anyone who attempts to lie when responding to a direct question posed by Mephistopheles must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom drain and be unable to speak for 24 hours (Mephistopheles can end this enforced vow of silence at will as a free action). This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Infernal Wings (Su)
    desc: Mephistopheles has three pairs of wings, and while the damage caused by all six wings is identical, the additional effect caused by a strike from a wing depends on its nature. A hit from one of his burning wings deals 1d6 additional points of fire damage and the creature struck must succeed at a DC 43 Reflex save or catch fire. A hit from one of his draconic wings deals 2d6 points of bleed damage. A hit from one of his raven wings causes permanent blindness unless the creature struck succeeds at a DC 43 Fortitude save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Profane Gift (Su)
    desc: As a full-round action, Mephistopheles can grant a willing non-devil a +4 profane bonus to one ability score; this also allows him to communicate telepathically with and use his mind-affecting spell-like abilities on the creature at any distance (even across planar boundaries). A creature can have only one such gift at a time. The profane gift can be removed with dispel evil or dispel law, or Mephistopheles can remove it as a free action, dealing 3d6 points of Charisma drain to the target (no save). In addition, a creature that accepts a wish from Mephistopheles immediately becomes lawful evil (Will DC 41 negates) and gains the benefits of good hope for 1 week, followed by the effects of crushing despair for 1d6 months (CL 30th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Description
Mephistopheles was formed by Asmodeus from the ashes and hellfire of the plane of Hell itself. He is an artist of f lattery and guile, a master of the infernal contract, and a warden of the chained prison plane of Caina. He is tireless in his hunt for new souls, and constantly seeks to lure mortals into signing theirs away in all manner of complex bargains and contracts. 

Mephistopheles appears as a muscular, 12-foot-tall, red-skinned humanoid.
