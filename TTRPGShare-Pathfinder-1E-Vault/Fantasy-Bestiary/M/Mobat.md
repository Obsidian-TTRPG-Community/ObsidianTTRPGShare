    desc: Once per day as a standard action, a mobat can produce an ear-splitting screech that stuns non-mobats in a 20-foot-radius burst. All creatures within the area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d3 rounds. Other mobats and urdefhans are immune to this effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

# Description
Mobats are magical giant bats with wolfish grins and immense wingspans. Survivors of a lost era, they are rarely seen beyond the dark forests and deep caves they haunt. Although mobats are omnivores, they vastly prefer the flavor of fresh meat over that of other prey. 

Mobats’ fur varies in coloration, from deep auburn to almost black, and their skin is black. A mobat’s wingspan is 15 feet across, and it weighs 250 pounds.
