# Description
Manus aspire to elevate members of a specific race or type of creature to enlightenment, adopting them collectively as special charges. Typically, this race or type of creature is chosen from those to whom the manu belonged during its most meaningful mortal incarnation, but this is not always the case.

 While most manus focus on a people’s enlightenment across a single Material Plane world, some ambitious manus follow their charges from world to world, continuing to elevate and guide them as they propagate among the stars. Manus are largely solitary, though they sometimes gather into tight-knit groups called rounds that coordinate efforts to guide their chosen peoples.
