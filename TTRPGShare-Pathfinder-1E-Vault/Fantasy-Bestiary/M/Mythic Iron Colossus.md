special_abilities:
  - name: Alternate Form (Ex)
    desc: As a full-round action, an iron colossus can transform its legs into a massive, destructive track. Its speed becomes 80 ft., it can’t be tripped, and it gains a trample attack that deals 4d8+30 damage. It loses its stomp attack. It can resume its base form as a full-round action.
  - name: Deadly Fumes (Ex)
    desc: An iron colossus emits a 30-foot-radius cloud of poisonous gas, exposing creatures that start their turn in this area.

Deadly Fumes: inhaled-save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage and sickened; cure 1 save.
  - name: Fire Absorption (Ex)
    desc: Not only is a flesh colossus immune to fire, but when targeted or hit by a spell or attack that would deal fire damage, it heals half the fire damage it would be dealt.
  - name: Selective Antimagic Aura (Su)
    desc: Spells with the fire descriptor and fire effects are unaffected by this field.
  - name: Siege Tower (Ex)
    desc: An iron colossus’s ballistae don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, and they reload themselves at the start of the colossus’s turn.
