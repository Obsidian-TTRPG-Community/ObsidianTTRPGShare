# Attack of Opportunity
**Trigger.** A creature within your reach uses a [Manipulate](../Traits/Manipulate.md) action or a [Move](../Traits/Move.md) action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it’s using.

---
You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
