You envision a simple bug and transform into a Medium animal battle form. When you cast this spell, choose ant, beetle, centipede, mantis, scorpion, or spider. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the [Animal](../../../Traits/Animal.md) trait. You can Dismiss this spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:
- AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 10 temporary Hit Points.
- [Low-light vision](Senses#Low-Light%20Vision).
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13, and your damage bonus is +2. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [Enfeebled](../../../Conditions/Enfeebled.md) condition). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- Athletics modifier of +13, unless your own is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:
