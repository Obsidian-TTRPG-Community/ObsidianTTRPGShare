**Variant Rule** Duels
- **Trigger** You attempt a melee [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md) against your opponent, but haven't rolled yet.
- **Requirements**: You're in a duel, you're trained in [Intimidation](/compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), and you rolled an [Intimidation](/compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check for initiative this round.
- **Activity**: Reaction

If you hit, your opponent becomes [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#Frightened). If your opponent is using [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) for initiative when this ability is used, they become [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) instead.
