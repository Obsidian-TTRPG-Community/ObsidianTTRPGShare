# Affix a Talisman (basic)
[exploration](/rules/traits/exploration.md)  [manipulate](/rules/traits/manipulate.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 565*  


- **Requirements**: You must use a [repair kit](../../TTRPGShare_Community_Vaults/Pathfinder_2E/equipment/items/repair-kit.md).

You spend 10 minutes affixing a talisman to an item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the [repair kit](../../TTRPGShare_Community_Vaults/Pathfinder_2E/equipment/items/repair-kit.md) with both hands. You can also use this activity to remove a talisman. Attaching more than one talisman to an item deactivates all the talismans. They must be removed and re-affixed before they can be used again.
