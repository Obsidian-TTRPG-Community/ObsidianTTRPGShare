# Administer First Aid (basic) [>>](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")
[manipulate](/rules/traits/manipulate.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 248*  

**Skill** [medicine](/compendium/skills.md#Medicine) (untrained)
- **Requirements**: You are holding [healer's tools](../../TTRPGShare_Community_Vaults/Pathfinder_2E/equipment/items/healers-tools.md), or you are wearing them and have a hand free.
- **Activity**: Two-Action

You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is [dying](/rules/conditions.md#Dying) or bleeding. If a creature is both [dying](/rules/conditions.md#Dying) and bleeding, choose which ailment you're trying to treat before you roll. You can Administer First Aid again to attempt to remedy the other effect.

- **Stabilize** Attempt a [Medicine](/compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check on a creature that has 0 Hit Points and the [dying](/rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition. The DC is equal to 5 + that creature's recovery roll DC (typically 15 + its dying value).
- **Stop Bleeding** Attempt a [Medicine](/compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check on a creature that is taking [persistent bleed damage](/rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), giving them a chance to make another flat check to remove the [persistent damage](/rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The DC is usually the DC of the effect that caused the bleed.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** If you're trying to stabilize, the creature loses the [dying](/rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition (but remains [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious)). If you're trying to stop bleeding, the creature attempts a flat check to end the bleeding.
> - **Critical Failure** If you were trying to stabilize, the creature's [dying](/rules/conditions.md#Dying) value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, it immediately takes an amount of damage equal to its [persistent bleed damage](/rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
