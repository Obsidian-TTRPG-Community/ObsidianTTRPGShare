# Escape (basic) [>](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[attack](/rules/traits/attack.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 470*  


- **Activity**: Single Action

You attempt to escape from being [grabbed](/rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](/rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), or [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). Choose one creature, object, spell effect, hazard, or other impediment imposing any of those conditions on you. Attempt a check using your unarmed attack modifier against the DC of the effect. This is typically the [Athletics](/compendium/skills.md#Athletics) DC of a creature grabbing you, the [Thievery](/compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC of a creature who tied you up, the spell DC for a spell effect, or the listed [Escape](/rules/actions/escape.md) DC of an object, hazard, or other impediment. You can attempt an [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](/compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check instead of using your attack modifier if you choose (but this action still has the [attack](/rules/traits/attack.md) trait).
