# Mana Storm Effects  
*Source: Outlaws of Alkenstar #2: Cradle of Quartz p. 70*  

| `d20` | Mana Storm Effect |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Bleaching** ([primal](/rules/traits/primal.md), [transmutation](/rules/traits/transmutation.md)) Fortitude. Creatures and objects within a radius of 10 feet per level are drained of color for 1 hour. A gnome affected by this effect must succeed at a Will save or become [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and unable to reduce this [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition below 1 while bleached of color; this is a [mental](/rules/traits/mental.md) and [fear](/rules/traits/fear.md) effect. |
| 2 | **Crawling Vermin** ([conjuration](/rules/traits/conjuration.md), [primal](/rules/traits/primal.md)) A monstrous, strangely colored insect hostile to all creatures appears within 60 feet. The creature that appears should be insectile in appearance and of a level approximately equal to the level of an animal summoned by [summon animal](/compendium/spells/summon-animal.md) of the storm's level. The GM determines the specific creature. After 1 minute, the creature can choose to either return where it came from or to remain. It's neither [summoned](/rules/traits/summoned.md) nor a [minion](/rules/traits/minion.md). |
| 3 | **Anchored** ([abjuration](/rules/traits/abjuration.md), [arcane](/rules/traits/arcane.md)) Will. Creatures within a radius of 10 feet per level are affected by [dimensional anchor](/compendium/spells/dimensional-anchor.md). Creatures that fail their saving throws also have their Speeds reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) during the effect's duration. |
| 4 | **Unluck** ([arcane](/rules/traits/arcane.md), [divination](/rules/traits/divination.md), [misfortune](/rules/traits/misfortune.md)) Will. A zone of unluck and strange violet illumination fill a radius of 10 feet per level for 1 hour. Creatures in this area roll attack rolls, [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks, saving throws, and skill checks twice and take the lower result. |
| 5 | **Strange Reversal** ([curse](/rules/traits/curse.md), [transmutation](/rules/traits/transmutation.md)) Fortitude. One creature's body and all its possessions reverse into a mirror image of themselves. This effect is permanent. |
| 6 | **Gravity Surge** ([arcane](/rules/traits/arcane.md), [transmutation](/rules/traits/transmutation.md)) Reflex. Creatures within a radius of 10 feet per level, in random order, are pushed 10 feet per level away from the nearest creature. A pushed creature that hits an object or another creature stops but takes falling damage equal to the distance moved (a creature hit takes the same amount of falling damage). |
| 7 | **Psychic Assault** ([illusion](/rules/traits/illusion.md), [mental](/rules/traits/mental.md), [nonlethal](/rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [occult](/rules/traits/occult.md)) Will. Creatures within a radius of 10 feet per level are affected by [phantom pain](/compendium/spells/phantom-pain.md). |
| 8 | **Dazzling Mein** ([illusion](/rules/traits/illusion.md), [occult](/rules/traits/occult.md), [visual](/rules/traits/visual.md)) One creature is affected by cloak of colors; that creature is immune to the effects, but all others around it are affected normally. |
| 9 | **Geyser** ([evocation](/rules/traits/evocation.md), [primal](/rules/traits/primal.md), [water](/rules/traits/water.md)) Fortitude. Water erupts from the ground, but rather than spraying directly up into the air, the water bends impossibly to surge along a horizontal path just above the ground, like a floating, torrential flood. This torrent of water manifests as a hydraulic torrent at first, eerily doing so in the most efficient line to catch as many potential targets in its path as it can. The water then splashes down into the sand, remaining as a long, thin swath of water that can provide a drinking source until it's soaked up or evaporates. |
| 10 | **Sudden Pit** ([conjuration](/rules/traits/conjuration.md), [earth](/rules/traits/earth.md), [primal](/rules/traits/primal.md)) Reflex. A pit opens beneath a random creature. The pit is as wide as the creature's space, so the creature can [Grab an Edge](/rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) to avoid a fall. The pit is 20 feet deep per level of the mana storm and remains open even in terrain normally unable to support such a structure. After 1 hour, the pit vanishes and anything that fell in is restored to the surface. |
| 11 | **Befuddlement** ([arcane](/rules/traits/arcane.md), [emotion](/rules/traits/emotion.md), [enchantment](/rules/traits/enchantment.md), [mental](/rules/traits/mental.md)) Will. A number of creatures up to the level of the mana storm within a radius of 10 feet per level become [confused](/rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 round per level. |
| 12 | **Death Field** ([necromancy](/rules/traits/necromancy.md), [primal](/rules/traits/primal.md)) Fortitude. Normal vegetation within a radius of 10 feet per level immediately dies and turns to ash. Plant creatures take `2d6` damage per level of the mana storm (basic Fortitude save). |
| 13 | **Strangers to All** ([arcane](/rules/traits/arcane.md), [curse](/rules/traits/curse.md), [enchantment](/rules/traits/enchantment.md), [mental](/rules/traits/mental.md), [misfortune](/rules/traits/misfortune.md)) Will. A number of creatures up to the level of the mana storm within a radius of 10 feet per level are affected by outcast's curse. |
| 14-15 | **Weird Rain** ([conjuration](/rules/traits/conjuration.md), [primal](/rules/traits/primal.md)) A rain of small objects (anything from flowers to rotten fruit) pelts an area with a radius of 10 feet per level of the mana storm for a number of rounds equal to the level. This rain doesn't harm creatures in the area. Creatures in the area have concealment. The objects remain even after the rain is over. |
| 16-17 | **Wellspring** ([primal](/rules/traits/primal.md), varies) The mana storm draws magical potential from deep within a random creature. That creature rolls `1d20` and uses the [Wellspring Surges](/rules/tables/wellspring-surges-som.md) table to determine a wellspring effect. |
| 18-19 | **Wondrous Effect** ([arcane](/rules/traits/arcane.md), [evocation](/rules/traits/evocation.md)) Randomly choose one creature to be a "wielder" and a different random creature to be a "target." Roll `d100` on the [rod of wonder](../../TTRPGShare_Community_Vaults/Pathfinder_2E/equipment/items/rod-of-wonder.md) table to determine what sort of strange effect occurs between the creatures. |
| 20 | **Double Strength** (varies) Reroll two results and apply both in the order rolled; further results of 20 on these rerolls have no effect. |
