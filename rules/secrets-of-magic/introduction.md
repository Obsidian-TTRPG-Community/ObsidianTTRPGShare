# Introduction
<sup>SoM p. 5</sup>

> [!pf2-sidebar] Chapter Summaries
> 
> _Secrets of Magic_ has five chapters, each detailing the practices of magic, those who harness its power, and the fruits of that power.
> 
> **Chapter 1—Essentials of Magic:** Learn how magic works from the writings of Golarion's magical luminaries. Then you'll find both common and rare backgrounds for characters with a magical past
> 
> **Chapter 2—Classes:** Fight while slinging spells with the magus, or form a special bond with a magical creature as a summoner. These full new classes are followed by their multiclass archetypes.
> 
> **Chapter 3—Spells:** Over 200 spells, including new rituals and focus spells for the magus and summoner, offer new tools for spellcasters of any tradition. Summon powerful entities, use magic for everyday tasks, harness the elements, and even manipulate time!
> 
> **Chapter 4—Magic Items:** Expand your collection with new consumables and permanent items. You'll also find sections on brand-new types of items, including fulu consumables, grimoires, magical tattoos, personal staves you design yourself, spell catalysts, and spellhearts you fasten to your gear.
> 
> **Chapter 5—Book of Unlimited Magic:** Dive deep into strange and new forms of magic, from the emotion-based cathartic magic to elementalism, geomancy, shadow magic, rune magic from ancient Thassilon, and more!

_Secrets of Magic_ goes beyond the basics of magic in ways both large and small. You'll find everything from a new cantrip that creates a small spout of water to rules for pervasive magic that can totally transform a campaign's world. And more than just the rules, this book digs deep into how magic feels and the ways spellcasters understand the magic of their world. Though the Essentials of Magic chapter goes in-depth on this topic, you'll find notes among the spells and magic items written by the people of Golarion, and the Book of Unlimited Magic explains in each section how that form of magic can affect roleplaying and the game world.

The knowledge and methods of magic recounted in this book come from all sorts of sources, and only the most seasoned experts in the game world are familiar with them all. When using these sources, consider which areas a given character or institution knows how to use or is familiar with—and, crucially, which ones they're unaware of. A druid who knows geomancy and druidic circles in great depth might be entirely unfamiliar with arts practiced by arcane or occult casters. Separate what you as a player or GM understand and think of fun wrinkles or misunderstandings a character might make based on their limited experience. As another example, the magical essences are crucial to magic working, but a follower of a certain tradition might only know the practical spellcraft that lets them actually use magic. They might be unaware of the deeper sources, or even consider them unnecessary to learn—frivolous time wasted on esoterica when one could be studying a new spell!

## Choosing Expansions
<sup>SoM p. 5</sup>

The _Pathfinder Core Rulebook_ and _Pathfinder Advanced Player's Guide_ include rules useful to the vast majority of games. Parts of Secrets of Magic aren't meant for every table. Chapter 5 in particular, with its new forms of magic, is more appropriate for certain games and circumstances than others. Some of that chapter's entries have rarities above common to more clearly indicate this. If you're running a game or want to use options like these for your character, think in advance about what their inclusion means for your game. You might even want to have a discussion about the implications with the rest of your group.

That said, Chapters 2, 3, and 4 are more broadly useful. Even if you don't want to have elementalists as a specific type of caster in your game, the elemental spells in Chapter 3 could still be useful for any caster of the appropriate tradition. The classes in this book are common, as are the vast majority of spells and magic items.

The pieces of this book are meant to play well together. Exploring the spells and items can open up more options for the new rules in the Book of Unlimited Magic, and the new classes will find spells that work well with their abilities. Pick and choose your favorites, and above all, experiment!
