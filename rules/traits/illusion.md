# Illusion  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 633*  

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the illusion school of magic, typically involving false sensory stimuli.

Illusions create the semblance of something real, fooling the eyes, ears, and other senses. They almost always have the [mental](/rules/traits/mental.md) trait, and depending on how the illusion is perceived, they might also have the [auditory](/rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](/rules/traits/visual.md) trait.
