## Biology

General biology information here, use the subheadings below for things you wish to detail more. You can change or add to them as needed, even per species.

### Lifecycle

## Behaviour

Same as before but for the species behaviour. Headings I added are a starting point, you can add more or less depending on your needs.

### Intelligence & Learning

### Temperament

### Social Structure

## Distribution & Habitat

Where and how in your world they are located, what sort of biomes they thrive in, etc.

## Special Attributes

This section is especially useful for magical creatures but could also be used to note other things such as if they are useful for a medicine or have special pelts or strength etc.

- **Attribute Name â€“**
	- Description. 


## History

Any known history of the creature, origin is the only heading I have added here as how much history you have and can go into will depend heavily on the species and your own desire to write it. I encourage you to add headings as needed.

### Origin


## Cultural Significance 

If the critter interacts with humans/people or they otherwise use them as symbols, iconography, etc, this is the place to put them. Not all animals will be domesticated but most will appear at some point in art, literature, song, etc. Some even as religious symbols. 

### Religion

### Domestication
#### Companionship
#### Entertainment
#### Sport
#### Warfare 
#### Work

## Breeds

If there are breeds of the animal you can list them here, either in detail or as a jumping point to their own, similar pages. 

## Related Species

## Gallery

If using ITS theme, the image snipper or minimal's gallery function you insert images, however many in a row you want to show up before hitting enter. Leaving a line between helps for clarity and makes it work properly in minimal.
