A a squat, round bottle with the bottom half wrapped in twine containing a rare distilled spirit from desert regions known as Aleaqrab. More commonly referred to as Scorpion Whiskey, the liquid is a dark, rusty brown, and is similar in viscosity to maple syrup, though it’s not nearly as sticky. The thickener is hidden at the bottom of the bottle: a scorpion tail, severed from a living creature. The tail is removed and immediately dropped into a full bottle of barley spirit; the mixture of blood and venom give the drink its trademark color and flavor, along with an unusual extra kick. Aleaqrab is traditionally drunk as a shot. It smells metallic and vaguely briny. It has a strong copper flavor with notes of honey, and a piquant burn closer to a hot pepper than regular alcohol. Drinkers of weak weak constitutions often find that the scorpion venom causes their mouth and tongue to go numb for hours after taking even a single shot. |

They can be thrown, shot from a sling or flask launcher (A modified light crossbow) or a length of twine has be tied to the eye-hook, creating a tripwire trap. |

A beaten copper death mask with garnet eyes. |
A beaten leather bag containing various pliers, knives, hooks, shears and mind-weakening drugs strapped to its interior. Knowledgeable PC’s will recognize the symbol of an order of demon hunters sewn into the inner lining, and deduce that these were one of their member’s interrogation tools. Kits such as these were incredibly useful for convincing cultists and evildoers of all kinds to divulge their nefarious plots, as the interrogation tools appear intentionally gruesome. More often than not, the very presence of the cruel looking instruments is enough to induce a prisoner to talk. Unfortunately, these tools also inspire some very convincing lies. The use of these tools (Even by virtue of having the victim see them or describing how they will be used and how immensely painful they will be) grants the bearer advantage on intimidate checks made while questioning prisoners, but they impose disadvantage on all sense motive or insight checks made to determine whether the information gleaned is accurate or not. |

A beautiful painting of a late autumn lake in the forest. The longer you look at it, the more mesmerizing it becomes. As you stare, the leaves on the trees seems to jostle in the wind, the lake seems to breathe as water, and my butts seem to drift ever so slightly into the sunset, like a portal into a perfect glimmer of peace. The only curiosity is a sad old man with a gnarled crown sitting upon a small bench, not quite in the foreground though impossible to ignore. He seems to loom over the lake, and is vaguely familiar… He seems to weep, giving the painting a sense of loss and sadness, as if this world so perfect was dying with him. |
A beautiful piece of quartz carved in a strange but unclear style. It is perfectly still until a certain tone is played near it whereupon it then begins to vibrate and move, gyrating sinuously. The carving causes the moving rock to resemble a lithe dancer. |

Despite being cool to the touch, the bells constantly reek of the corrosive smell of hot metal. Knowledgeable PC’s will remember a set of stories involving a form of malevolent necromancy which used a series of bells in order to animate corpses and bind dead souls to their will. It was said that a powerful enough mage using the right bells could gain complete master over life and death.

The goggles fit tightly against the face so that the only light entering is through the slits and soot was applied to the inside to further cut down on glare.

A silver chain on which hangs a polished silver bell the size of a thimble. At one point in the bearer’s life, the bell will ring three times, producing three bursts of silvery sound with a brief silence after each.

A single black envelop upon which is a single silver glyph, lightly afire. You do not recognize the language, nor even the alphabet of the burning symbol. Regardless, while touching the mysterious inscription you are instinctively aware of its meaning, as if the words were branded with eldritch fire directly on the grey matter of your soft humanoid brain; “VACATION APPROVED”.

Knowledgeable PC’s will remember that the horn was constructed for one purpose, to lock a terrible beast away deep within the mountain of Redwall.

A sturdy leather cord tied into an intricate knot that writhes in the hands of the bearer. |

The pleading note reads as follows: “Ruin has come to our family. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor. I lived all my years in that ancient rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury, and yet I began to tire of… conventional extravagance. Singular unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on… swarthy workmen and… sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness. In the end, I alone fled, laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity. Until consciousness failed me. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you, return home, claim your birthright and deliver our family from the ravenous clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon.” |

An ancient stone tablet on which is chiseled a prayer dedicated to an elder God of madness and destruction, who currently sleeps beneath the waves of the deepest ocean. The words can be read and understood by any sentient creature regardless of their linguistic skills.

Knowledgeable PCs will know that the elder god has no true temple or shrine to its name and its only worshipers are deranged cultists.

An object made from a cross piece of wood and many colors of brightly woven yarn in a geometric pattern vaguely resembling an eye. Knowledgeable PC’s will recognize this as a “God’s Eye” which is a symbol of the power of seeing and understanding that which is unknown and unknowable. The four points represent the elemental processes: earth, fire, air, and water. The weaving of a God’s Eye is an ancient contemplative and spiritual practice for many peoples. |

An opaque jar that cannot be opened or broken |
An opaque, black eyepatch that the bearer can see through perfectly. |
An ordinary looking black ceramic cup that hides a tiny secret compartment in the thick bottom of the cup which can serve as an excellent place to store a small item or substance. The compartment is designed with a weighted catch that opens when the cup is tilted back, thereby releasing the hidden substance into the contents of the cup. The compartment is hard to spot when the cup is empty and all but impossible to find when filled. |
An ordinary looking black scarf containing five chicken eggs firmly secured in secret pockets. Close inspection shows the eggs have been drained of the yolk with two small pinpricks and have been filled with fine powdered ash then resealed with dabs of wax. These eggs can be used as thrown weapons or launched from a sling. Upon impact these eggs explode, throwing up a small butt of ash that quickly dissipates. This can distract creatures, provide partial cover or potentially blind. These homemade smoke grenades are meant for distraction and misdirection rather than as an offensive weapon and don’t deal any damage. |
An ordinary looking hens egg that defies all efforts to crack it open or otherwise damage it. |
An ordinary looking wooden cased compass that points east at dawn, west and dusk and spins randomly all other times. |

An ornate brass plaque engraved with a history of a crossbow bolt that is supposedly mounted on it. The plaque says that during the siege of castle Châlus by the invading King Richard (Who is described as a warlord who had devastated the nearby lands with fire and sword) a young cook stood on the edge of the castle walls. The boy, not quite yet a man held a crossbow in one hand and a frying pan in the other. The cook fended off stray arrows with his makeshift shield as he lined as target in his sights. King Richard, who was known to take walks unarmored at the edges of the various sieges he lead locked eyes with the boy and applauded his courage. The cook’s aim was true and his bolt found a new quiver in the king’s neck, ending the siege and a reign of terror. It’s a moving story, however the bolt in question is nowhere to be found, although there is a rectangular depression in the plaque where a glass case or display piece should be placed. |

An ornate brooch of dwarven design |

The glass is warm to the touch and is as durable as steel. |
An ornate lacquered box containing a set of spoons, thirteen in number. Each is topped with a tiny figure that represents one of the Immortal Heroes of an eastern cult that is thought to be extinct.

An ossified venom gland of a large spider that are prized as rare gems when set in Draenic jewelry. |
An oval-shaped soapstone tablet, inscribed with a short list of religious prohibitions |
An oval-shaped stone the size of a human eye, made from the darkest obsidian. The color is the purest black, and the glossy surface shines like a mirror. The reflections are strangely distorted, as it seems to reflect shadows rather than light. It is rumored in some occult circles that in the same way that a person can fall sick from a dark plague, so too can a ray of light become infected by shadow. |

An uncommonly convincing glass eye that’s completely unusable due to being fully spherical. |
An uncut black gemstone. Occasionally it makes the sound of a hammer striking an anvil. |

An unused calligraphy kit |
An unused, stainless steel machete |
An unusual standing lamp made of brass sporting a vented wheel over top of its wick and a number of crystal chimes along its outer edges. When lit, the rising hot air from the flame slowly turns the wheel which has a number of outward reaching pins which strike the chimes creating soothing tinkling noises, while the light refracting from the crystals creates a rosy glow. While much more suited for an upscale pleasure den, the lamp is sturdy enough for travel if carefully wrapped in fabric beforehand. The lamp will burn for six hours on a flask (One pint) of oil. |
An urgent letter requesting help. The date indicates that it’s from over a hundred years ago, but its linguistics are more suited to more current times. |
Apple of Doubt: A fruit that looks like an apple, it tastes like an apple, it smells like an apple, for all intents and purposes it appears to be an apple, but you are certain it is not an apple. |
Automatic Whetstone: A small unremarkable whetstone that never wears out and when touched to a dull edge and let go, starts sharpening it automatically. The whetstone stops and falls to the ground when the edge has been sharpened to perfection. |
Bag of Useless Junk. A tattered burlap sack that jingles as if it were full of broken glass, rusty nails and wooden scraps even when empty. The bag actually generates its own trash and three times per day, the bearer can reach into the sack and withdraw a Random Worthless Trinket. |
Bane of the Kitchen’s Apprentice: A white sous chef hat that causes the bearer to cause any recipe to go awry, no matter their skill or the simplicity of the recipe. The food will come out tasting ghastly anytime the hat is worn while the bearer is cooking. |
Barbed Vest: A black leather dotted with hundreds of tiny, barbed, fishhook-like needles, which are covered in thin leather flaps that prevent harm to the bearer. The barbs function as a last line of defense against close quarter attacks. A creature that injures the bearer with a natural weapon (Claws, teeth, fist, tail swipe) or successfully grapples the bearer has a 50%!c(MISSING)hance of taking 1 hitpoint’s worth of damage as they catch themselves on the barbs. Any creature that swallows the bearer takes 1 point of damage each round until it either spits him up, the bearer escapes, or the bearer dies (At which point the vest has sustained enough damage to no longer serve as a threat). The vest can be worn over simple clothes as well as lighter armors such as padded or studded leather but not over anything heavier. |
Beauticians clippers: Once per day the bearer can use the clippers to cause finger or toenails grow as if a month had gone by allowing damaged nails to be trimmed and cleaned much easier. |
Coin of Indecision: A gold coin with the word “YES” on one side and the word “NO” on the other. If it is flipped while asking a question, the coin always lands on edge. |
Darkvision Spectacles, Damaged: A pair spectacles made of smoked glass lenses set in a wire frame that fits most humanoids. Knowledgeable PC’s recognize these as type of magical item known as Darkvision Spectacles. Normally these glasses would allow a creature to see as if it had Darkvision, allowing the user to see in black and white out to the limits of their vision while in perfect darkness. It seems as though the enchantment is failing, the item was damaged, or the item simply wasn’t created properly, as the darkvision no longer functions. The remaining magic seems to be trying to overcompensate and creatures looking through the spectacles only see in black-and-white and are not able to discern color. |
Eye of Tyr: A gift from the God of Justice, this pommel gem gleams with a holy fire. Legends say that if the stone were to be set into the hilt of a weapon of virtue by a true believer and wielded by a warrior of the faith, the result would be a blade capable of carving a righteous swath through all the evils that plague the Realms. |
Five crossbow bolts that have religious blessings etched onto the hafts. |
Five decorated armbands that label the bearer as a member of the Cult of Unseen Turmoil. |
Genevieve’s: A small tin canister containing a few dozen candies that (According to the labelling), were accidentally synthesized by the gnomish alchemist Genevieve Boghopper. They’re big lumpy balls that rapidly change colors, each representing a different flavor, until they come into contact with saliva. The instructions mention that trying to put it in your mouth at the right moment to get your favorite flavor is a challenge and fun game. |
Half of a broken mask of brittle iron. An impassive, large-eyed face shows on the front, genderless. Within, the mask is not smooth, but convoluted by the canals, chambers, and processes of the facial skeleton, as if this shattered mask once composed the front portion of a living skull. |
Half of a floorplan for a temple, castle, or some other structure |
Half of a snapped oak battle standard. “We will fight to the last” is written in dried blood on one side. |
Half of a templar’s amulet depicting the sorcerer king Hamanu |
heavy copper coin on which the face on the coin has been carved into an elegant skull. Knowledgeable PC’s will be able to recognize the mark as the symbol of a local thieves guild and can find a saying in thieves cant carved around the edge of the coin. |
Innocent Lockpicks: A set of nondescript masterwork thieves’ tools coated in a matte black lacquer, that seems brittle enough to break. They are favored by spies and thieves that cannot afford to be caught with the tools of their trade. As an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, the bearer can break the brittle coating of the tools, causing them to dissolve into a puff of smoke, destroying the evidence of any wrongdoing. Because of their fragile nature these tools have a chance of breaking. If the bearer rolls a natural 1 while using the tools, there is a 25%!c(MISSING)hance that the tools snaps and dissolves in his hands. The item’s properties are wholly mundane and do not register as magical. |
Kolain Drop: A small tin canister containing a few dozen candies made from amber sugar, spun into a shape resembling the outline of a teardrop (Although a cynic might claim they look like candy nooses) and coated in dark chocolate. Licking a Kolain makes it harder to concentrate on sad memories for a short while, but finishing a whole drop while focusing on a specific memory accentuates the positive emotions of that memory and makes it easier to deal with the associated negative emotions. |
Magebane Mine, Inert: A ordinary looking red brick that knowledgeable PC’s recognize as an ancient mage slaying mine. The theory was that it was able to detect the innate magical presence within an individual and detonate. It was an complex experimental weapon back in its day and doesn’t seem to work properly at the moment. The device has magical as well as mechanical components and they would be dotted randomly throughout entire towns in walls, roads and residential buildings effectively “protecting” whole areas from mages and spellcasting creatures. The mechanical components would explode if their enchantments were dispelled and their magical payload would detonate if their physical components were disabled, making them all but impossible to neutralize. In fact the most common way to disable one (Assuming it could be distinguished, as it blended in like a brick in a brick wall) was to purposely trigger it from afar which tended to cause massive property damage. A spellcaster was required for most of the mine’s construction which would explain why they were not mass produced. No mage of the time wanted to be responsible for massacring their own kind. This specific mine seems to be defective as it’s physical components are in disrepair and the enchantments have faded, but a skilled enough mage, engineer or artificer might be able to repair it. |
Mirror of Self-Interest: A small steel mirror that doesn’t reflect anything but the face of the person holding it. However, this image of the person is perfect, devoid of any flaws or incongruities with the holder’s appearance as though they were the most attractive person in the province. This image is also only visible to the bearer. |
Neverspill Mug: Any drink poured into this mug can never be spilled accidentally. Someone can be struck upside the head with it, without a single drop escaping. |
One square foot of preserved human skin showing a map that changes randomly. |
Orb of forgetfulness. When touched the orb you will remember the last thing you tried to think about but forgot. You will however forget why you wanted to remember it. |
Pocket Watch of The Far Realm: A blued steel pocket watch with a silver chain that always tells the accurate time of the entire plane of the far realm. The far realm is a place beyond space and time. The pocket watches hands move fast and sporadically, sometimes even gaining a third and fourth hand. It is completely useless at telling the time on the material plane. |
Reveler’s mug: A large horn mug that cannot be turned upside down while containing liquid. If one attempts to do so, the mug changes shape in their hands so that it does not spill. |
Scabbard of Readiness: A scabbard comprised of metal and leather straps that can be adjusted to fit most weapons. When the bearer is surprised by foes, this scabbard instantly teleports into its bearer hand. Any weapon inside the scabbard remains where it was and typically falls to the ground immediately. |
Seastone Chalice: A two-handled drinking cup is wrought from some sort of pale blue-green material and inlaid with gold. The outside is rimmed with salt crystals which regenerate when brushed away, but these don’t seem to affect the chalice itself. When water is placed into the cup, it is instantly rendered salty and undrinkable. In addition, the cup produces deafening sounds of surf until it is emptied. Non-water beverages, such as alcohol, milk, juice, etc. are unaffected. |
Several dried moose ears sewn together and fashioned into a sheath for an average sized dagger |
Shivered Timber: A large shard of wood from a pirate ship’s mast that is constantly tipped with frost. The implement can be used a focus for casting spells that deal cold damage. |
Song Collar: A set of iron tubes designed to aid traveling musicians in learning new or complex compositions for the lute, violin, or another similar stringed instrument. Built to fit snugly over a normal quarterstaff, this item consists of a long metal collar that slips down over the top half of the staff, roughly two feet long for a typical staff. The metal’s surface is covered with rows of small, dimpled indentations, ostensibly to provide a better grip on the staff. In reality, these indentations correspond with the fingering for a piece of music to be played on a preferred instrument of the owner. Song collars crafted gnome engineers as training tools for journeymen, enabling them to practice chords and notes while traveling without attracting attention. A creature can actively learn or practice an instrument while traveling and maintaining a normal walking pace. While practicing on the move, the bearer suffers disadvantage on perception checks and is only considered to be practicing half as quickly as normal. For example a PC attempting to learn ho to play the lute who trains while walking for eight hours is only considered to have practiced for four hours towards becoming proficient in the instrument. |
Sprigs of dried hemlock, mistletoe and nightshade bound together with a red ribbon. |
Stone Sleeve: A stone sleeve is little more than a narrow cloth tube that is tied to the inner forearm so the opening rests in the palm. The sleeve can then be filled with up to six good-sized throwing stones or sling bullets. The sleeve can be opened with ease, allowing the bearer to arm himself with one of the rocks stored within as a free action. |
The “alchemical” recipe and blueprint for a “Big Mama”, a strange series of nested barrels filled with gunpowder and nails and designed to detonate from a fuse. |
The blade of an ancient sword. A mysterious coat of arms is carved into it. |
The bleached white skull of a human child. A perceptive PC will notice that the interior of the top of the skull bears a small white lump. The lump is a gold key that had been glued inside the skull and covered in white paint. |

The fang of a white wyrm engraved with the name of a lost tribal chief. |
The gold-coloured fleece of an unknown species of mountain animal. |
The Heart of the Damned: An ancient dried human heart that still beats loud and strong and that takes its name from the legend of the man that it came from. Legend has it that during a brutal war, the cause of which has long been forgotten, a keep was besieged. The lord of the keep knew that his walls would soon be overrun and, rather than surrendering and having his people enslaved, he slew them all. When the besiegers next attacked they found the lord standing amongst the slain, the sole survivor of the entire keep. The lord was burned at the stake and the legends say that his heart would not burn not matter how hot the flames became. According to superstition, the lord’s tortured soul is bound to the heart and he will suffer the heat of the flames eternally until the curse is broken. The heart resists all damage and cannot be burned or destroyed. A proper series of blessings or rituals could cleanse the heart and lift the curse, if a being was so inclined to grant that sort of absolution to a mass murderer. |
The hilt of a dagger that was used to assassinate a king. Its onxy pommel glows ominously on nights with a full moon. |
The mostly straight bones of a humanoid bound with rough twine to make a macabre sort of ladder, rolled into a bundle. |

The skeletal hand with six fingers and a thumb. It a slight but constant aroma of brimstone. |
The skeleton of an unknown animal encased in a mound of yellowing resin. It is much like a garden frog in both size and shape, albeit a garden frog with long claws and a protracted, toothy snout. |
The skull of a dire tiger, painted in infernal runes and mounted upside-down on a pedestal of black basalt carved in the shape of an erinyes who holds the basin up. The skull’s eye sockets are filled with blood coloured star-sapphires. |
The steel tip of a horn capped in plain steel and pointed like the punch-shape of a bodkin arrow. Dry, keratinous splinters of horn, fragile with age, are still stuck on the inside. |
The stuffed and preserved remains of a large bat. |
Three knuckle-bones that have been carved into dice. |
Three small crystal vials of what appear to be red blood. The vials are marked with druidic signs for son, beast-man and bird. |
Three stones linked together by a sturdy piece of rope, the stones are engraved with the words for ‘beginning’, ‘middle’ and ‘end.’ |
Two coin sized disks of magnetized steel with layer of iron filaments sandwiched between them. If the disks are separated by a few inches, a miniature tornado comprised of iron filaments springs up between them anchored on each end to a disk. |
Two glass eyeballs in a tarnished silver box with gold hinges. The orbs lie on dusty, red velvet divots. They are green glass and irregularly shaped in the back. Oddly convoluted inside, like jelly and fish eggs. Gold leaf irises lie under the hard, crystal lenses. |
Two toy soldiers, one with a missing head |
Unending Chalk: A stick of chalk can be used to draw, but never gets shorter or breaks. |
Wand of False Life: An elm wand that if set down on a solid surface, will sprout tiny legs and arms, and move around like a living thing, spontaneously wandering around in a small area and sometimes dancing, particularly if there is music being played. It isn’t actually alive and will not move more than three feet from where it was placed. The arms and legs will fold away if the wand is picked up, but it always seems to have an elongated face as part of the grain of the wood at one end. |
