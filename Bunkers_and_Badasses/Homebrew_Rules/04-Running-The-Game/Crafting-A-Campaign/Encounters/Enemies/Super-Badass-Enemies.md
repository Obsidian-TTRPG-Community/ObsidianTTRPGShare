## Super Badass Enemies

>[!homebrew]
> Warning: This content is a Homebrew created for Bunkers and Badasses.

Like normal Badass Enemies, except even faster, even stronger, and even more full of murder.

All Enemy types have Badasses, and Super Badasses, so when spawning Enemies you can always choose to spawn a Super Badass of the Enemy type by calculating Triple the Badass Rank. 

For example, a Super Badass Skeleton would have a Badass Rank of 9 instead of the normal Skeleton BR of 3. 

Super Badass Enemies also have the following compared to their non-Super Badass counterparts:
- Triple the base Health, Armor, and Shields
- Gain Shields and Armor Equal to 1/2 Health if they did not have Shields and Armor before
- They use Actions and Mayhem Actions freely. 

Additionally, they get a two modifiers from the table below, rolled at random or chosen by the BM.
