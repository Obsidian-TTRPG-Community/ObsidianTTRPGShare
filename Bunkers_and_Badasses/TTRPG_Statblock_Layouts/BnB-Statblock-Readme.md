## How to Use: Movement

The Movement property currently supports the following items:

- move x
- leap x
- burrow x
- flight x
- teleport x
- swim x

x equals the amount of squares the monster can move.

You can use any of these and it will list them under the movement arrow, along with an icon indicating what type of movement and how many squares it will move. Do not use commas.

_Hover can be treat the same as flight, or be utilized as a Trait._

## How to Use: Traits

Traits currently will wrap text if you have a monster that has many traits. However, this can make your code-block very, very big and weird looking. If possible, try to make your custom traits a special or an action.

## How to Use: Loot

The Loot section is intended only for the weird, obscure loot items you want to absolutely include on a monster in that bestiary at all times, typically bosses who drop a peculiar quest item. The is optional and if there is nothing entered in loot, the field disappears.
