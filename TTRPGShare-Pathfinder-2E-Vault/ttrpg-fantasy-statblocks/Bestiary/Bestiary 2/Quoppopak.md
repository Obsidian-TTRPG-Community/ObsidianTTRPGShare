    desc: "⬺ __Requirements__ The quoppopak's ventral tube is in water  __Effect__  The quoppopak uses Tentacle Stab against a creature within reach; if either of these [[Strike|Strikes]] hits, the creature must attempt a DC 30 Reflex save. On a failed save, the quoppopak shoots water through its tentacles into the creature, dealing 2d6+5 (2d6+5) bludgeoning damage and making the creature [[sickened|sickened 1]] as its internal organs fill with water (double damage and [[sickened|sickened 2]] on a critical failure)."
  - name: "Tentacle Stab"
