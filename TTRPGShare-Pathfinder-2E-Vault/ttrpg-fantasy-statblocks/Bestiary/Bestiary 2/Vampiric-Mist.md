    desc: "  A vampiric mist's body is composed of a semisolid red mist similar in consistency to thick foam. This enables a vampiric mist to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch in diameter with no reduction to its Speed. However, a vampiric mist can't wear or interact with objects. It also can't enter water or other fluids, and it's treated as Tiny for the purpose of how wind affects it."

    desc: "  When a vampiric mist damages a creature with a misty tendril [[Strike]], the creature must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If the [[Strike]] was a critical hit, the outcome of the creature's save is one degree worse than the result of the saving throw. Any temporary Hit Points the vampiric mist gains from Blood Siphon fade after 1 hour.\n__Success__ The creature is unaffected.\n__Failure__ The creature is [[drained|drained 1]], and the vampiric mist gains 5 temporary Hit Points.\n__Critical Failure__ The creature is [[drained|drained 2]]. The vampiric mist gains 10 temporary Hit Points and takes on an intense red until the end of its next turn. During this time, it gains a +2 status bonus to AC and saves and is [[quickened|quickened]]. It can use its extra action only to [[Strike]]."
