  - name: "Head Regrowth"
    desc: "  A jotund troll ordinarily has nine heads, and they can use regeneration to regrow a head that is severed from an effect like a vorpal weapon. After regaining Hit Points from regeneration, the jotund troll attempts a DC 8 flat check. On a success, one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully restored. If a jotund troll loses their last remaining head, they die immediately."
  - name: "Multiple Opportunities"
    desc: "  A jotund troll gains an extra reaction per round for each of their heads beyond the first, which they can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity with their jaws or to Fast Swallow. They can't use more than 1 reaction for the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within their reach, and the jotund troll must use a different head for each [[Attack of Opportunity]] they make. Whenever one of the jotund troll's heads is severed, the troll loses 1 of their extra reactions per round."
