  - name: "Truth Vulnerability"
    desc: "  A glabrezu's lies sustain them, and the truth can destroy them. Whenever a [[revelation]] effect counteracts or reveals the glabrezu's illusions or the glabrezu fails a save against an effect that would prevent them from lying (such as zone of truth), the demon takes 3d6 (3d6) mental damage. They take this damage only once per effect, even if the effect reveals multiple illusions or prevents multiple lies."

  - name: "Captive Rake"
    desc: "⬻ __Requirements__ A creature is [[grabbed|grabbed]] in the glabrezu's pincer.  __Effect__  The glabrezu pulls the [[grabbed|grabbed]] creature up to 5 feet closer, then makes two claw [[Strike|Strikes]] against it. Those [[Strike|Strikes]] count as one attack when determining a treachery demon's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after both [[Strike|Strikes]]."
