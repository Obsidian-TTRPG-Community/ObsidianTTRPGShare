On a success, the flytrap deals the damage from one leaf [[Strike]] plus an additional 1d8 (1d8) damage for every leaf beyond the first. On a failure, the flytrap deals the damage from one leaf [[Strike]], but it can't use [[Improved Grab]]. It deals no damage on a critical failure. This counts toward the flytrap's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of leaves the flytrap has."
