    desc: "  The mimic is coated in an adhesive slime. Any creature that hits the mimic, is hit by the mimic, or otherwise touches the mimic must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save or become [[grabbed|grabbed]] ([[Escape]] DC 23). A weapon that hits the mimic is stuck to the mimic and can be removed with a successful DC 23 [[Athletics]] check (made as a single action). A mimic can have any number of objects or creatures stuck to it at a time. The mimic can release a stuck creature or object by using a single action, and the adhesive dissolves 1 minute after the mimic dies, releasing all stuck objects and creatures."
  - name: "Object Lesson"
    desc: "⬲ __Trigger__ A creature touches or physically interacts with the mimic while the mimic is transformed using Mimic Object. __Effect__  The triggering creature is automatically stuck by the mimic's adhesive (it receives no save). The mimic then makes a pseudopod [[Strike]] against any creature adjacent to the mimic. Object Lesson can't be used again until the mimic escapes and takes on a new disguise."

It has an automatic result of 28 on [[Deception]] checks and DCs to pass as the object that it's mimicking."
