    desc: "⬺ ([[attack]], [[conjuration]], [[occult]]);  Once per day, an annis hag can cause a cage built of cold iron fingernails to spring out of nothingness at a range of up to 30 feet, attempting an [[Athletics]] check to [[Grapple]] against the target's Fortitude DC; if the target has a weakness to cold iron, the annis hag gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Unlike a normal [[Grapple]], the annis hag doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it. It has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points."
