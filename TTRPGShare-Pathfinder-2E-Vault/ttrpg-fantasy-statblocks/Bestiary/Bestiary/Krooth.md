    desc: "⬻ ([[poison]]); __Requirements__ The krooth damaged a creature with its jaws on its most recent action this turn.  __Effect__  The krooth snaps off one of its teeth in the creature it hit. The creature takes 1d6 (1d6) [[persistent damage|persistent bleed damage]] and is [[drained|drained 1]]. Neither can be healed while the tooth remains. Removing the tooth safely requires a successful DC 26 check to [[Administer First Aid]]. Instead of ending bleeding or stabilizing, this removes the [[drained|drained]] condition, but it doesn't automatically end the bleed damage."
