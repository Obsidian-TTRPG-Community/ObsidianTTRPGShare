  - name: "Repair Mode"
    desc: "  When the adamantine golem is at 0 HP, it isn't destroyed. Instead, it enters repair mode, during which it is [[slowed|slowed 1]], can't take reactions, and can take only the Self-[[Repair]] action. Once it has more than 30 HP, it can use any type of action and can use reactions, though it remains [[slowed|slowed 1]] and can't take any reactions until the start of its next turn. If a critical hit with an adamantine vorpal weapon reduces the golem to 0 HP, or if such a weapon hits it while it's already at 0 HP, then the golem is destroyed."
  - name: "Vulnerable to Dispelling"
    desc: "  The golem can be targeted by disjunction and dispel magic. If targeted by such a spell of 9th level or higher, the golem has its resistance to physical damage lowered to 15 and is [[slowed|slowed 1]] (or [[slowed|slowed 2]] if in repair mode) for 1d4 (1d4) rounds. During this time, if the golem is reduced to 0 HP while already in repair mode, it is destroyed."
