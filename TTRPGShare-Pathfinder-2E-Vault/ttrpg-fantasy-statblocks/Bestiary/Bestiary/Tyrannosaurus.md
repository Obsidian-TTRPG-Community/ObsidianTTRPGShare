The creature falls 25 feet (assuming the tyrannosaurus flings it as high as it can) and takes falling damage accordingly. If the flung creature lands on another creature, the creature it lands on takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage. The creature being landed on can attempt a DC 23 basic Reflex save."

As long as the tyrannosaurus doesn't move from its position, the pinned creature is [[Grabbed|Grabbed]]. A tyrannosaurus gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack a creature it has pinned in this manner, but it cannot use Swallow Whole on the target unless it uses its jaws to Grab the victim first."
