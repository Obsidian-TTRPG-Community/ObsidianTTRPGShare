    desc: "⬻  The minotaur snorts and clomps as it hunts its prey, inspiring terror. The minotaur makes an [[Intimidation]] check to [[Demoralize]] all living creatures within 60 feet that can hear the minotaur but not see it. Roll once and apply the result to all creatures. If the targets are in a maze or similarly difficult-to-navigate structure, the minotaur gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Creatures that become [[frightened|frightened]] as a result also take a –2 circumstance penalty to [[Survival]] checks to avoid getting lost for 1 minute. This use of [[Demoralize]] doesn't have the [[visual]] trait. Each target is temporarily immune for 1 minute."
