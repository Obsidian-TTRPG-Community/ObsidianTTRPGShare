    desc: "⬽ ([[concentrate]], [[divine]], [[transmutation]]);  Nine lantern archons can use this activity, all within 1 round of the first, to merge together to form a composite being for 7 rounds that appears as a glowing warrior of light. The gestalt has the base statistics of a legion archon (AC, saving throws, attacks, skills, Speeds, and so on) but the spells and special abilities of a lantern archon. Additionally, it has a ranged light ray [[Strike]] (+18 attack, Damage 3d4 (3d4) fire and 3d4 (3d4) good), and the bonus from its Lantern of Hope increases to +3. When the gestalt separates, its remaining Hit Points are divided evenly among the lantern archons, and if the gestalt had fewer than 9 HP, some of the lantern archons die."
