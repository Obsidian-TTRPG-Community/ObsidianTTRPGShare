    desc: "⬺ ([[cold]], [[evocation]], [[primal]]);  The ice linnorm spews out a blast of freezing, viscous ooze in a 60-foot cone that deals 15d6 (15d6) cold damage to creatures within the area (DC 38 basic Reflex save). The freezing ooze clings to those struck and hardens into thick sheets of ice. A creature that fails the saving throw is [[immobilized|immobilized]] by the ice until it succeeds at a check to [[Escape]] or it or an ally Forces Open the ice (DC 34 for either case). At the start of its turn, a creature still [[immobilized|immobilized]] by the ice takes 4d6 (4d6) cold damage. Another creature can free a frozen target by dealing a total of 20 fire damage to the frozen target. Left unattended, the ice crumbles away in 1 minute on its own. Creatures with the [[fire]] trait can't be frozen in place by this breath weapon. Flying creatures fall if frozen, and swimming creatures that are frozen rise toward the surface of the water at a speed of 60 feet per round. An ice linnorm can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 (1d4) rounds."
