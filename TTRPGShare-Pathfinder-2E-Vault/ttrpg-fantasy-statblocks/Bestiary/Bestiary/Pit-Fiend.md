  - name: "Devil Shaping"
    desc: " ([[divine]], [[downtime]], [[transmutation]]);  The pit fiend reshapes a large number of lemures within a 600-foot radius into more powerful devils to swell Hell's legions. The pit fiend must have available the number of lemures listed on the table in the sidebar on page 92. The pit fiend can shape 100 lemures per day, to a maximum of 1,100 lemures in 11 days. Devils created in this way are in thrall to the pit fiend and follow its orders, with the exception of created pit fiends or other devils of similar power, which are always independent. As a result, few pit fiends choose to create peers. At the end of the Devil Shaping activity, the pit fiend attempts an incredibly hard [[Religion]] check of the desired devilʼs level, with results as follows.\n__Critical Success__ The pit fiend shapes two devils from the massed lemures instead of one.\n__Success__ The pit fiend shapes a devil of the desired type and level.\n__Failure__ The devil shaped from the lemures is 2 levels lower than the intended devil.\n__Critical Failure__ The pit fiend fails to shape any devils and draws the ire of an archdevil for its waste of resources."
