  - name: "Construct Armor"
    desc: "  Like normal objects, a giant animated statue has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once a giant animated statue is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 22."
abilities_bot:
  - name: "Brazier"
    desc: "  The statue carries a wide brazier full of hot coals. To make flaming coal [[Strike|Strikes]] or use Burn Alive, the statue must have the brazier held in one hand or otherwise have it within reach. Instead of targeting the statue with an attack, a creature can target the brazier directly. The brazier has the same AC and saves as the statue. Dealing 15 cold damage to the brazier or dousing it with at least 2 gallons of water extinguishes the coals. This prevents the statue from using Burn Alive and causes its ranged attacks to no longer deal 2d8 (2d8) fire damage."
  - name: "Burn Alive"
    desc: "⬻ ([[fire]]);  The statue grinds a creature it has [[grabbed|grabbed]] into the red-hot coals of its brazier. The target takes 3d8 (3d8) fire damage and 1d8 (1d8) [[persistent damage|persistent fire damage]]."
