    desc: " ([[necromancy]], [[primal]]);  A redcap's woolen hat is dyed with the blood of its victims. If the redcap loses its cap, it no longer benefits from fast healing and takes a –4 status penalty to its damage rolls. It can create a new cap in 10 minutes, but that cap doesn't grant its powers until the redcap has turned it red with Blood Soak. A cap has no benefit for creatures other than the redcap who made it."

It then becomes temporarily immune to all brandished religious symbols for 10 minutes.\n__Critical Success__ The redcap is unaffected.\n__Success__ The redcap is [[frightened|frightened 2]].\n__Failure__ The redcap gains the [[fleeing|fleeing]] condition for 1 round and is [[frightened|frightened 4]]."
