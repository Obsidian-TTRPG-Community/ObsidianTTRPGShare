    desc: " ([[acid]], [[poison]]);  When the grothlut is reduced to 0 Hit Points, its digestive organs rupture, unleashing alchemical acid and poison upon all creatures in a 30-foot emanation. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 2d6 (2d6) acid damage and become [[sickened|sickened 1]] (double damage and [[sickened|sickened 2]] on a critical failure)."

Each non-grothlut creature that enters or starts its turn within the area must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or become [[sickened|sickened 1]] ([[sickened|sickened 2]] on a critical failure). The creature then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute. The grothlut can activate or deactivate the aura by using a single free action that has the [[concentrate]] trait. A grothlut usually does not begin moaning until it senses the presence of a non-grothlut creature, and it usually stops once it doesn't sense any more such creatures."
