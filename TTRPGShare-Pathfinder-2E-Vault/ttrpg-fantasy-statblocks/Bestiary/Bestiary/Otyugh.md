  - name: "Stench"
    desc: " ([[aura]], [[olfactory]]);  40 feet. A creature entering the aura must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be [[sickened|sickened 1]] (plus [[slowed|slowed 1]] for the same duration on a critical failure). On a success, the creature is temporarily immune to the [[sickened|sickened]] and [[slowed|slowed]] effects of this stench for 1 hour. Regardless of the save, while within the aura, creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against diseases. An otyugh's stench is due to the offal and refuse that it wallows in, so cleaning the creature thoroughly (with create water and sufficient scrubbing, for example) deactivates the aura, while a sufficiently plugged nose allows an individual to avoid exposure to the stench."
