    desc: "⬽ __Requirements__ The executioner is adjacent to a [[dying|dying]] creature or a creature specifically prepared for a killing blow  __Effect__  The executioner [[Strike|Strikes]] the creature with their greataxe. On a hit, in addition to taking damage, the target must attempt a Fortitude save or be reduced to 0 HP and become [[dying|dying 1]]. If the creature was already [[dying|dying]] (including if it was reduced to 0 HP by the [[Strike]]'s damage), the creature's [[dying|dying]] value increases by 1, in addition to any increase from the [[Strike]]. On a critical failure, the creature dies instantly. If the executioner's [[Strike]] was a critical hit, the target uses the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of their saving throw."

If it hits and deals damage, the target is [[frightened|frightened 1]], or [[frightened|frightened 2]] on a critical hit. Mark for Death ⬻ (concentrate) The executioner marks a single creature they can see for death. The first time each round the executioner [[Strike|Strikes]] that creature, the [[Strike]] deals 1d12 (1d12) additional precision damage. The creature remains marked for death until the executioner is knocked out, marks a different creature for death, or the encounter ends."
