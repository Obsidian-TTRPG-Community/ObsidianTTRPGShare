    desc: "  A specter that goes for more than a month without dealing negative damage to a living humanoid becomes desperate and almost feral. It changes alignment from lawful evil to chaotic evil, loses control of any corrupted thralls it might have, and becomes [[quickened|quickened]]. It can use its additional action only to make vile touch [[Strike|Strikes]] against humanoid targets. At the end of any turn in which it deals any amount of negative damage to a living humanoid, it reverts to lawful evil and is no longer [[quickened|quickened]], but any thralls it lost control of remain free."

    desc: " ([[curse]], [[divine]], [[enchantment]], [[incapacitation]], [[mental]]);  When the specter damages a living creature with its vile touch [[Strike]], the specter gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the target creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save to avoid becoming corrupted.\n__Critical Success__ The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to spectral corruption for 1 minute.\n__Success__ The creature is [[stupefied|stupefied 2]] for 1 hour.\n__Failure__ The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral thrall. The creature is [[controlled|controlled]] by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. It can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer [[controlled|controlled]] by the specter but becomes [[stupefied|stupefied 2]] for 1 hour.\n__Critical Failure__ As failure, but the creature remains a thrall to the specter until the curse is removed or until the specter succumbs to pain starvation; it can't attempt new Will saves to recover on its own. called shiver (Gamemastery Guide"
