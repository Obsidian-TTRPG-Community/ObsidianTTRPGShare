    desc: "  The beast tamer fights alongside a trained animal ally of its level or lower, most likely a tiger (Bestiary 53). The animal has the standard number of actions, uses its normal stat block, and counts toward the encounter's XP budget normally. The beast tamer can spend 1 action to gain the support benefit appropriate to its trained animal (Core Rulebook 215). Unlike for an animal companion, this doesn't require the animal to use any of its actions."
