    desc: " ([[abjuration]], [[divine]]);  Every kami is bound to a ward: a specific animal, plant, object, or location. A kami can merge with or emerge from their ward as a single action, which has the [[concentrate]] trait. While merged, the kami can observe their surroundings with their usual senses as well as the senses of their ward, but can't move, communicate with, or control their ward. Additionally, a kami merged with their ward recovers Hit Points each minute as if they spent an entire day resting. A kodama's ward is a specific tree."

abilities_bot:
  - name: "Spiritual Rope"
    desc: " ([[abjuration]], [[divine]]);  The kodama spends 1 minute to fashion an enchanted straw rope out of nearby materials. The rope can be wrapped around other kami creatures to protect them from fell forces. A kami who wears a spiritual rope gains resistance 5 to evil damage (though this is usually relevant only if the kami is good-aligned), a +1 status bonus to AC against evil creatures, and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects from evil creatures. A kodama always wears a spiritual rope, and they can have one other spiritual rope in existence at a time. Creating a new rope beyond these two releases the magic of one other rope of the kodama's choosing. A spiritual rope around a creature other than a kodama loses its magic after 24 hours or if it's taken outside of the kodama's forest."
