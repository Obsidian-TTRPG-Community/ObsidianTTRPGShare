    desc: "  Dorus have a weakness for secrets, hoarding them like a miser hoards gold. A creature can tempt a doru with some bit of obscure knowledge the doru doesn't know or thinks they don't know. Presenting the hint of the secret is a single action, which has the [[concentrate]] and [[linguistic]] traits, and requires a skill check using [[Deception]], [[Lore]], or [[Performance]] (or some other appropriate skill determined by the GM) against the doru's Will DC. On a success, the doru is [[fascinated|fascinated]] for as long as the presenter draws out the explanation of the secret (spending 1 action each round doing so, to a maximum of 1 minute). On a critical success, the doru is [[fascinated|fascinated]] for that duration plus 1 minute more as it ponders the implications of the secret. Regardless of the outcome, the doru is temporarily immune to that creature's attempts to present it with secrets for 1 day."
