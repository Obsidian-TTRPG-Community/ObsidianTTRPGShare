    desc: " ([[incapacitation]], [[primal]], [[transmutation]]);  A peck from a cockatrice hardens the flesh of the creature struck. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become [[slowed|slowed 1]] (or [[slowed|slowed 2]] on a critical failure). Further failed saves against calcification increase the [[slowed|slowed]] condition. Once a creature's actions are reduced to 0 by calcification, that creature becomes [[petrified|petrified]]. Every 24 hours after it was [[petrified|petrified]], the victim can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it becomes flesh again, but is [[slowed|slowed 1]] for the next 24 hours. On a critical success, the creature recovers and isn't [[slowed|slowed]]. On a failure, the creature remains [[petrified|petrified]], but can try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure, the petrification is permanent, and the creature can't attempt any more saves."
