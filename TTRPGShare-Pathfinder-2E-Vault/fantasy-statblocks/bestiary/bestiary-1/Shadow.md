    desc: "  When a creature's shadow is pulled free by Steal Shadow, it becomes a shadow spawn under the command of the shadow that created it. This shadow spawn doesn't have Steal Shadow and is perpetually and incurably [[clumsy|clumsy 2]]. If the creature the shadow spawn was pulled from dies, the shadow spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous shadow. If the creature recovers from its enfeeblement, its shadow returns to it and the shadow spawn is extinguished."

This is cumulative with other [[enfeebled|enfeebled]] conditions from shadows, to a maximum of [[enfeebled|enfeebled 4]]. If this increases a creature's [[enfeebled|enfeebled]] value to 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated from its body (see shadow spawn). [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] from Steal Shadow decreases by 1 every hour."
