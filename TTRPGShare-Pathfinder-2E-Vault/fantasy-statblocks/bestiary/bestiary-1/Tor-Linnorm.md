    desc: "⬺ ([[evocation]], [[fire]], [[primal]]);  The tor linnorm expels a 60-foot cone of flame and ash dealing 20d6 (20d6) fire damage to creatures within the area (DC 46 basic Reflex save). At the start of the tor linnorm's next turn, the area affected by the breath weapon is covered in thick, scorching smoke that burns both the lungs and eyes, dealing an additional 10d6 (10d6) fire damage to all creatures in the area (DC 46 basic Reflex save). A creature that spends an entire round in the smoke with open eyes must succeed at a DC 44 Fortitude save or is [[blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute. The smoke dissipates after 1 minute; in strong winds, the smoke dissipates in 5 rounds, and in more powerful winds, it may clear even more quickly. The tor linnorm can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 (1d4) rounds."
