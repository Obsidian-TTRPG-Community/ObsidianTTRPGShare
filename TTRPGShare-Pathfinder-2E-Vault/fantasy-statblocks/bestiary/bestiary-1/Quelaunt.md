    desc: "⬻ ([[attack]], [[emotion]], [[incapacitation]], [[mental]]); __Frequency__ once per round  __Effect__  The quelaunt feeds on the emotional unrest of a single creature within 30 feet that's under a harmful [[emotion]] effect. The target must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or take 4d10 (4d10) mental damage and be [[stunned|stunned]] for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw, the quelaunt regains the same number of Hit Points and Feed on Emotion does not cost the quelaunt an action, allowing it to use another action this turn."
