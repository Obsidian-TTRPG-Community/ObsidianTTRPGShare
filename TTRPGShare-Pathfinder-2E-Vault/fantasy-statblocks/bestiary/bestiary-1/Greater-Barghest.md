    desc: "⬻ ([[concentrate]], [[divine]], [[polymorph]], [[transmutation]]);  The barghest takes on the shape of a goblinoid (a goblin, hobgoblin, or bugbear) or a wolf, or it transforms back into its true form. When the barghest is a goblinoid, it loses its jaws and claw [[Strike|Strikes]], it becomes Small if it is a goblin, and its Speed changes to 20 feet. When the barghest is a wolf, its Speed changes to 40 feet and its jaws gain Knockdown. Each individual barghest has only one goblinoid form and one wolf form."

    desc: "⬺ __Trigger__ The barghest completes a [[Strike]]. __Effect__  The process of consuming corpses to evolve into a greater barghest results in odd and unpredictable physiological changes. A greater barghest has one mutation, typically chosen from the following options.<ul class='inner-bullet-list'><li>__Fangs__ (poison) The barghest grows elongated fangs that seep poison. Its jaws deal 1d6 (1d6) additional poison damage and 1d6 (1d6) [[persistent damage|persistent poison damage]].</li><li>__Toxic Breath__ (divine, evocation, poison) The barghest breathes a cloud of toxic gas that deals 8d6 (8d6) poison damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). It can't use Toxic Breath again for 1d4 (1d4) rounds.</li><li>__Vestigial Arm Strike__ ⭓ Frequency once per round; The barghest makes a claw [[Strike]] with a shriveled third arm hanging from its torso. This attack doesn't count for the barghest's multiple attack penalty, nor does that penalty apply on the attack.</li><li>__Wings__ The barghest has malformed wings extending from its back. It gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.</li></ul>"
