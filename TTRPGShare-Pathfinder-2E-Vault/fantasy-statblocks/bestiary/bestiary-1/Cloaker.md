    desc: "⬻ ([[attack]], [[incapacitation]]);  The cloaker makes an attack roll with a +14 bonus against an adjacent creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it envelops the target, who is [[restrained|restrained]]. Attacks that hit an enveloping cloaker deal half their damage to the cloaker and half to the trapped victim. The cloaker can't [[Fly]], and when it moves using its land Speed it moves the enveloped creature with it. The cloaker can make only jaws [[Strike|Strikes]] against the [[restrained|restrained]] creature but can make tail [[Strike|Strikes]] against other creatures. A creature that voluntarily puts on the cloaker becomes engulfed automatically. A cloaker can engulf only Large or smaller creatures, and no more than one creature at a time."
