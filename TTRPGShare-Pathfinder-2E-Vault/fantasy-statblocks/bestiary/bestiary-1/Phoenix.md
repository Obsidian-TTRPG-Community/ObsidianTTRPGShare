  - name: "Self-Resurrection"
    desc: " ([[healing]], [[necromancy]], [[primal]]);  When a phoenix dies, it collapses into a pile of smoldering ashes before returning to life fully healed 1d4 (1d4) rounds later, as if subject to a 7th-level resurrect ritual. Self-resurrection happens only if there are some remains to resurrect; for instance, a phoenix killed by a [[disintegrate]] spell can't use this ability. A phoenix whose remains rest within an area devoted to an evil deity by consecrate can't self-resurrect until its remains are no longer in that area. A phoenix can self-resurrect only once per year."
  - name: "Shroud of Flame"
    desc: " ([[aura]], [[evocation]], [[fire]], [[primal]]);  20 feet. 4d6 (4d6) fire, DC 37 basic Reflex save. While this aura is active, any adjacent creature that hits the phoenix with a melee attack or otherwise touches it takes 2d6 (2d6) fire damage. The phoenix can activate or deactivate the aura with a single action, which has the [[concentrate]] trait."
