    desc: " ([[aura]], [[divine]], [[evocation]], [[fire]]);  20 feet. A foe that starts its turn in the aura takes 3d6+10 (3d6+10) fire damage, or 6d6+20 (6d6+20) fire damage if the balor has [[grabbed|grabbed]] or [[restrained|restrained]] it. A creature that hits a balor with an unarmed [[Strike]] takes 3d6+10 (3d6+10) fire damage, and weapons that hit a balor take 3d6+10 (3d6+10) fire damage."
  - name: "Attack of Opportunity"
    desc: "⬲  The balor can use [[Attack of Opportunity]] when a creature within their reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to its normal trigger. They can disrupt triggering concentrate actions, and they disrupt actions on any hit, not just a critical hit."
  - name: "Death Throes"
    desc: " ([[death]], [[divine]], [[evocation]], [[fire]]);  When a balor dies, their body explodes in a 100-foot aura of intense demonic flame. All creatures and objects in range take 16d10 (16d10) fire damage (DC 45 basic Reflex save). Because the flame is infused with Abyssal energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures with immunity to fire use an outcome one degree of success better than what they rolled, instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity. The bodies of creatures reduced to 0 Hit Points by a balor's death throes are completely incinerated into fine ash."

    desc: " ([[divine]], [[evocation]]);  Any weapon a balor wields becomes a +3 major striking vorpal weapon made of cold iron and silver while the demon holds it. A weapon that isn't eligible for the vorpal rune doesn't gain its effects. The balor can change its evil damage to chaotic whenever it attacks.
