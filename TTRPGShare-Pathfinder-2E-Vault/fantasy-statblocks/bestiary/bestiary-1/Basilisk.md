    desc: "⬺ ([[arcane]], [[concentrate]], [[incapacitation]], [[transmutation]], [[visual]]);  The basilisk stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. That creature must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save. If it fails and has not already been [[slowed|slowed]] by Petrifying Glance or this ability, it becomes [[slowed|slowed 1]]. If the creature was already [[slowed|slowed]] by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a failed save causes the creature to be [[petrified|petrified]] permanently. A creature [[petrified|petrified]] in this manner that is coated (not just splashed) with fresh basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk that has been dead no longer than 1 hour) is instantly restored to flesh. A single basilisk contains enough blood to coat 1d3 (1d3) Medium creatures in this manner."
