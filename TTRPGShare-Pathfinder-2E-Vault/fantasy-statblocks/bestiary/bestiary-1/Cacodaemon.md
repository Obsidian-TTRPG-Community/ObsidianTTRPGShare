    desc: "⬽ ([[death]], [[divine]], [[necromancy]]);  Once per day, a cacodaemon can ingest the soul of a sentient creature within 30 feet that died within the last minute. When it does, the cacodaemon grows a fist-sized soul gem (Hardness 2, HP 8) in its gut and can regurgitate it at any time as an [[Interact]] action. Destroying the gem frees the soul within but does not return the deceased creature to life. The caster of a spell to return a creature to life whose soul is trapped within a soul gem must succeed at a DC 30 [[Religion]] check. On a success, the soul gem shatters and the creature is returned to life as normal for the spell. By using an [[Interact]] action, a fiend can ingest a soul gem it is holding, condemning the soul to the fiend's home plane. The fiend gains fast healing 5 for 1 minute."
