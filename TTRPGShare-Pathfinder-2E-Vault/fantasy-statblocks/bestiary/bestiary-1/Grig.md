A listener is temporarily immune for 10 minutes on a success, but otherwise, if the grig continues to Fiddle each round, the creature receives no additional saves.\n__Success__ No effect.\n__Failure__ [[Flat-footed|Flat-footed]] and –10-foot status penalty to Speeds.\n__Critical Failure__ As failure, and also [[slowed|slowed 1]]."
