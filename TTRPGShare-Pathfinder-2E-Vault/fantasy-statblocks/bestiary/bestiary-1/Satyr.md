    desc: " ([[enchantment]], [[mental]], [[primal]]);  A satyr's wineskin magically enchants any alcohol inside. With an [[Interact]] action, a living creature can imbibe the alcohol and gain a +1 item bonus to Will saves and a +3 item bonus to Will saves against [[fear]] effects for the following hour. When the wineskin is removed from a satyr's person, the magic remains only until the wine spoils. The wineskin holds up to eight drafts of wine."

  - name: "Play the Pipes"
    desc: "⬽ ([[auditory]], [[primal]]); __Requirements__ The satyr is holding a musical instrument.  __Effect__  The satyr plays a melody on his instrument to cast [[charm]], [[fear]], [[sleep]], or [[suggestion]] without expending the spell slot and using his music in place of providing the spell's component actions. The spell gains the [[auditory]] trait and targets all creatures in a 60-foot emanation instead of its usual targets. A creature that succeeds at its Will save against any spell is then temporarily immune from spells played from that satyr's pipes for 1 minute. Satyrs are immune to this music."
