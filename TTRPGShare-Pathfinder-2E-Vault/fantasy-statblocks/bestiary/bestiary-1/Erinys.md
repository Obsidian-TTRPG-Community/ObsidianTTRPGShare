    desc: "⬽  The erinys hovers in place if they are flying and fires one arrow at any number of creatures in a 30-foot cone. Each attack is rolled separately. This counts as one attack for the purpose of the erinys's multiple attack penalty."
  - name: "Rope Snare"
    desc: "  An erinys carries a coil of rope woven of their hair (use the statistics for rope) that animates in their hands. When a creature is hit by the erinys's rope, a segment of the rope tears loose and wraps itself around the creature, imposing a 10–foot circumstance penalty to Speed. The piece that tears off is 10 feet long for a Medium or smaller creature, and doubles in length for each size larger than Medium. When a creature [[Escape|Escapes]] the effect (DC 26), the detached segment of rope withers away into useless black sludge."
