  - name: "Regurgitate"
    desc: "  The purple worm can violently regurgitate a creature or boulder it has swallowed to make a ranged [[Strike]]. The [[Strike]] deals bludgeoning damage depending on the size of the projectile: Tiny deals 2d6+13 (2d6+13), Small 3d6+13 (3d6+13), Medium 4d6+13 (4d6+13), Large 5d6+13 (5d6+13), and Huge 6d6+13 (6d6+13). A regurgitated creature takes falling damage from the height of the target or from 20 feet, whichever is greater. Boulders occupy space in the worm's stomach as a creature of equivalent size, and purple worms often have several boulders swallowed. A purple worm can use a single action to swallow a new boulder."
