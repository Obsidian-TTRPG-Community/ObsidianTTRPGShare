All creatures in a 10-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be [[blinded|blinded]] for 1d6 (1d6) rounds. Creatures with light blindness who successfully save are still [[blinded|blinded]] for 1 round. The creeper's gear and treasure are left in a pile where they died. As this isn't a [[magical]] effect, the light has no effect within magical darkness."
