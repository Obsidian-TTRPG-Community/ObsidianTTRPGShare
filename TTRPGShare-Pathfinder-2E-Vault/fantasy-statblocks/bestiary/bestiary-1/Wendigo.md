    desc: "  A target that fails its save against the wendigo's nightmare is exposed to wendigo torment."
  - name: "Howl"
    desc: "⬽ ([[auditory]], [[concentrate]], [[enchantment]], [[fear]], [[incapacitation]], [[mental]], [[primal]]); __Frequency__ three times per day  __Effect__  The wendigo unleashes a forlorn howl that can be heard up to 1 mile away. Any creature that hears the howl must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or be [[frightened|frightened 1]]. Any creature that critically fails and is within 120 feet of the wendigo is instead [[frightened|frightened 3]], and is also [[fleeing|fleeing]] for 1d4 (1d4) rounds (or until it's no longer [[frightened|frightened]], whichever comes first). A creature [[frightened|frightened]] by a wendigo's howl still naturally recovers from its fright but can't reduce it below [[frightened|frightened 1]] in this way until 1 hour has passed or magic is used. Whether it succeeds or fails its save, a creature is then temporarily immune to that wendigo's Howl for 24 hours."
  - name: "Ride the Wind"
    desc: "⬲ ([[air]], [[concentrate]], [[primal]], [[transmutation]]); __Trigger__ The wendigo casts wind walk while it has [[Grabbed|Grabbed]] a foe. __Effect__  The wendigo attempts to turn the [[grabbed|grabbed]] creature into wind and carry it along as part of the action. If the target succeeds at a DC 38 Will save, it prevents itself from being transformed; in this case, the wendigo still transforms, automatically releasing the victim. A creature forced to Ride the Wind along with the wendigo is exposed to wendigo torment. The target can attempt a new Will save each round to return to normal, though it immediately becomes corporeal and begins falling if it succeeds."
