    desc: "⬻  The manticore flings up to two spikes from its tail, targeting either two different creatures or a single creature. If the manticore targets two different creatures, these creatures must be within 20 feet of one another, and the manticore makes a separate [[Strike]] against each; this counts as only one [[Strike]] for the manticore's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks. If the manticore fires both spikes at the same creature, it makes a single [[Strike]]. If the attack hits, it deals the damage of a single spike, but the target is pinned in place, rendering it [[immobilized|immobilized]]. A creature that succeeds at a DC 23 [[Athletics]] check (attempted as a single action) can pull the spike free. A manticore can hurl no more than 12 spikes in 24 hours."
