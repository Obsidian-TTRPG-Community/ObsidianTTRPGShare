  - name: "Free Blade"
    desc: "⭓ __Trigger__ The ghaele ends its turn while unable to act or attempts a greatsword [[Strike]] that would take a circumstance or status penalty. __Effect__  A ghaele's blade is implacable in the pursuit of freedom, and its energies can overpower any effect that would interfere with its swordplay. The ghaele attempts to counteract each effect that prevents it from making a greatsword [[Strike]], gives it a penalty to its greatsword [[Strike]], or prevents it from acting. The ghaele can use this ability even if it's otherwise unable to act."

It can also change its energy resistance to any of these energy types (this can be a different type than for its attacks). The choices remain until it next uses Choose Weakness."
