    desc: "⬻ ([[concentrate]], [[occult]], [[polymorph]], [[transmutation]]);  The raja rakshasa takes on the appearance of any Medium humanoid. This doesn't change the raja rakshasa's Speed or its attack and damage modifiers with its [[Strike|Strikes]] but might change the damage type its [[Strike|Strikes]] deal (typically to bludgeoning). It typically loses its fangs [[Strike]] unless the humanoid form has fangs or a similar unarmed attack."
  - name: "Disturbing Vision"
    desc: "⬻ ([[concentrate]], [[enchantment]], [[mental]], [[occult]]);  The raja rakshasa's eyes flash green as it projects a telepathic wave in a 30-foot emanation. All creatures in the area are assailed by a vision of evil decadence from one of the rakshasa's past lives. Each non-evil creature in the area must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or become [[sickened|sickened 1]] (and [[stunned|stunned 1]] on a critical failure). The visions last 1d4 (1d4) rounds, and while they do, the raja rakshasa and all evil creatures in the area gain a +1 status bonus to all checks. The raja rakshasa can use this ability again only once the previous visions end."
