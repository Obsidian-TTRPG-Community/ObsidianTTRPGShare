    desc: "⬲ __Trigger__ A creature within reach of the roper's strand leaves a square during a move action it's using. __Effect__  The roper makes a strand [[Strike]] against the triggering creature."
abilities_bot:
  - name: "Extend Strands"
    desc: "⬻  The roper extends or retracts six thin, sticky tendrils from its body. While the strands are extended, the roper takes a –4 circumstance penalty to [[Stealth]] checks, and while they're retracted, it can't use its strand [[Strike|Strikes]]."
  - name: "Flurry of Strands"
    desc: "⬻  The roper makes a strand [[Strike]] with each of its strands (except those that are immobilizing creatures). Each attack must be against a different target. These attacks count toward the roper's multiple attack penalty, but its multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks."
  - name: "Pull the Strands"
    desc: "⬺  The roper pulls every creature [[grabbed|grabbed]] by its strands toward itself. The roper rolls a single [[Athletics]] check and compares the result to each [[immobilized|immobilized]] creature's Fortitude DC. The roper pulls each creature it succeeds against up to 25 feet closer and each creature it critically succeeds against up to 50 feet closer."
  - name: "Sticky Strand"
    desc: "  Any creature hit by a roper's strand is [[enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] and [[grabbed|grabbed]]. Each additional hit from a strand increases the [[enfeebled|enfeebled]] condition value by 1 (to a maximum of [[enfeebled|enfeebled 4]]). This [[enfeebled|enfeebled]] value decreases by 1 every 8 hours. The roper can move while it has a creature [[grabbed|grabbed]] with a strand, but it automatically releases the creature if it moves beyond the strand's reach. The roper can release an [[grabbed|grabbed]] creature as a free action. A creature can sever a strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals at least 18 slashing damage. This doesn't deal any damage to the roper itself, though it can no longer attack with a severed strand."
