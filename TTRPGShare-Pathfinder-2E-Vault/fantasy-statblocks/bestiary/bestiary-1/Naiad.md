  - name: "Water Dependent"
    desc: "  A naiad bonds to a spring, pool, pond, or similar-sized water feature. While within 300 feet of her bonded body of water, she can use her innate tidal surge at will. She doesn't recover Hit Points or reduce the [[drained|drained]] condition when resting beyond that range. Unlike most other nymphs, she doesn't suffer penalties from being apart from her bonded body of water. A naiad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond herself to a new body of water."
