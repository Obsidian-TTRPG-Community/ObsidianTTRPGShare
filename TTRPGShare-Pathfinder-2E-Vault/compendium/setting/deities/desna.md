## Divine intercession
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic p. 20*

Desna favors those who follow their hearts and whims without bringing harm to others.

- **Minor Boon** For those at the end of a journey, Desna gifts a deep sleep. Once, after you rest, you completely recover all Hit Points, remove all negative conditions, and become free of any curses or diseases.
- **Moderate Boon**: Desna twists fortune in your favor. Once per day, after determining the result of a check, you can reroll the check and take the new result.
- **Major Boon**: Desna bestows you with a swirling cloud of lights that forms a pair of wondrous butterfly wings. These wings grant you a fly Speed of 40 feet and shine dim light to a range of 20 feet.

- **Minor Curse**: You always seem to lose your way or have strange mishaps on the road that delay your travel. You (and thus any group that travels with you) travel at only 3/4 normal exploration Speed, before taking into account the terrain and other features that might slow you down further.
- **Moderate Curse** Misfortune follows you in your travels and requires acts of contrition or benevolence to keep at bay. You must always roll twice and take the worst result when attempting a check. This is a [misfortune](../../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect. You can express your remorse and ignore this effect for `1d4` rounds by spending an action, which has the [concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. If you perform a truly selfless act of compassion, you ignore this effect for 1 day.
- **Major Curse**: The stars rebuke you for your ways. You are [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) whenever you are exposed to starlight.
