## Divine intercession
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic Web Supplement p. 7*

The Strong Man's gifts reflect his mastery of might.

- **Minor Boon** The Strong Man blesses you with a measure of his strength. Increase your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 2.
- **Moderate Boon**: You fear no exertion. You can employ exploration tactics normally while [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued).
- **Major Boon**: You possess a true champion's might. When you roll a critical failure on an [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) check, you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success, you instead get a critical success.

- **Minor Curse**: Difficulty lifting burdens is a sign of divine disapproval. Your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits decrease by 2.
- **Moderate Curse** Kurgess's displeasure breaks your competitive edge, causing you to fail at the cusp of success. If your check result exactly equals the DC, you fail instead of succeeding.
- **Major Curse**: The wrath of Kurgess withers you almost to nothing. You are permanently [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) and [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled).
