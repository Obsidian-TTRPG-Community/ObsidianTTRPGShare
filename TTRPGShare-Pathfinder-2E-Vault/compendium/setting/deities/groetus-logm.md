## Divine intercession
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic Web Supplement p. 6*

The God of the End Times almost never directly intervenes in the world, but he sometimes offers flashes of insight or inflicts terrible psychic distress.

- **Minor Boon** You wield power over disorder. Once, when you are [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused), you act normally enough to control your own actions in combat without penalty for the duration, though you still babble incoherently and otherwise behave strangely.
- **Moderate Boon**: Groetus grants you knowledge to further the end times. Each week, he sends you a cryptic, incoherent message about something important to the end times that will happen in the coming week.
- **Major Boon**: Your touch unravels things that have survived past their appointed time, according to Groetus's reckoning. Such a creature or object takes `10d6` negative damage each round you continue touching it; the damage ignores all Hardness and is capable of destroying nonliving objects, creatures immune to negative effects, and even undead or other creatures with [negative healing](../../../rules/abilities/negative-healing-b2.md). This boon might even be able to destroy some [artifacts](../../../rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md) that have survived past their time.

- **Minor Curse**: Whenever you are illuminated by a light source other than natural sunlight, your head appears to be a bare skull. The DC for your recovery checks is 12 + your [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) value, rather than 10 + your [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) value, and you don't benefit from effects that reduce the DC, such as from the [Toughness](../../feats/toughness.md) feat.
- **Moderate Curse** The horrors at the end of reality become overwhelming and constantly race through your mind. You are permanently [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied).
- **Major Curse**: You bring about the end to everything around you. Every item you carry or wear gains the [broken](../../../rules/conditions.md#Broken) condition after 10 minutes of exposure to you, and is destroyed after a further hour. This effect can't destroy [artifacts](../../../rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md) or items of similar power.
