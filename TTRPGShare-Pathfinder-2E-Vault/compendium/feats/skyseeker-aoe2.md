# Skyseeker  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [open](../../rules/traits/open.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sky and Heaven Stance](sky-and-heaven-stance-aoe2.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Sky and Heaven Stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) toward an opponent. At any point in the Leap, you can make a single [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature within your reach. At 12th level, if you hit with this Strike, instead of finishing your Leap, you can immediately attempt a second Leap from the space where you struck the target of your Strike. You can make a single Strike against a target within your reach during this second Leap as well. At 16th level, you can attempt a third Leap if your second Strike hits, and you can attack a target at any point during this third Leap.

All Leaps made during this activity gain a +10-foot status bonus to the total height or distance of your leap, and no two [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) can target the same creature.
