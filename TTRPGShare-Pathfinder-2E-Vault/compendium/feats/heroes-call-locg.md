# Heroes' Call  *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  


The songs of ancient heroes echo through your mind and quicken your pulse, especially in dire straits. You gain [heroism](../spells/heroism.md) as a 3rd-level innate occult spell that you can cast once per day. If you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) when you have half or fewer Hit Points, you also gain temporary Hit Points equal to twice your level.
