# Exploitive Bomb  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 16*  
[additive <2>](../../rules/traits/additive.md)  [alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Trigger** You craft an alchemical bomb using [Quick Alchemy](../../rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) that's at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

You mix a substance into the bomb to foil resistances. The bomb reduces any resistance the enemy has to its damage type by an amount equal to your level, but only for that attack.
