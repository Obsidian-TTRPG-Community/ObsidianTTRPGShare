# Terrain Form  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](mummy-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You crumble to pieces, becoming composed of the very terrain to which you're bound, with the effects of the [gaseous form](../spells/gaseous-form.md) spell, or you reconstitute into your normal form. The substance you're formed of depends upon your bound terrain, and the action gains the corresponding trait or traits.

- **Arctic** Snow ([water](../../rules/traits/water.md))
- **Desert** Sand ([earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md))
- **Mountain** Cloud ([water](../../rules/traits/water.md))
- **Swamp** Mud ([earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md), [water](../../rules/traits/water.md))
