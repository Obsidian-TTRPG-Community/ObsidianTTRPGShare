# Expanded Luck  *Feat 5*  
[catfolk](../../rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cat's Luck](cats-luck-apg.md)

You are luckier even than most catfolk. You can trigger Cat's Luck when you fail or critically fail a Fortitude or Will saving throw in addition to Reflex saving throws. You still can use Cat's Luck only once per day.
