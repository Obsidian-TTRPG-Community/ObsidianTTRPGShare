# Skeleton Commander  *Feat 13*  
[skeleton](../../rules/traits/skeleton-b1.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)

You gain the ability to summon your own skeletal minions. You learn the create undead rituals (Core Rulebook 411) to create three types of undead for which you meet the prerequisites. These undead must have the [skeleton](../../rules/traits/skeleton-b1.md) trait or be other skeletal undead the GM agrees to. You can't teach these rituals to anyone else, and you can't participate in either ritual while allowing someone else to serve as the primary caster unless they also know the ritual.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) checks for create undead rituals. You can also perform the ritual without the aid of a secondary caster; in this case, you attempt the secondary check normally performed by that caster.
