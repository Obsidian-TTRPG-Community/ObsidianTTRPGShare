# Glamour  *Feat 13*  
[rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fey Influence](fey-influence-loil.md)

You unlock a new level of fey power and can manipulate the perceptions of others using a font of First World magic. You gain the [fey glamour](../spells/fey-glamour.md) focus spell (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 404) as a primal spell that doesn't have the [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md) trait. If you don't already have a focus pool, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.

**Special.** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
