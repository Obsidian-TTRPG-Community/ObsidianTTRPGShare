# Silent Sting  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golden League Xun Dedication](golden-league-xun-dedication-frp2.md), expert in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)
- **Trigger** You make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a weapon of light bulk.
- **Activity** Reaction

You quickly hide your weapon to make it difficult to pin the attack on you. You attempt to [Conceal an Object](../../rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) to hide the triggering weapon. Your [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check is compared to the [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC of all creatures within 30 feet that can see you. You automatically succeed against creatures farther than 30 feet. The target of your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) gains a +4 circumstance bonus to their [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC for this check. If your [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check is a success, you hide your weapon so well that the creature can't clearly determine where the attack originated.
