# Holistic Care  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy), [Treat Condition](treat-condition-apg.md)

You provide emotional and spiritual care.

Add [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied), and [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) to the list of conditions you can reduce with Treat Condition. If the [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Treat Condition to reduce it.
