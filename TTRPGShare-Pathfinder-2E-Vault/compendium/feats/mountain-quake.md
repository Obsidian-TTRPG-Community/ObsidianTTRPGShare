# Mountain Quake  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mountain Stronghold](mountain-stronghold.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in [Mountain Stance](mountain-stance.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You stomp, shaking the earth beneath you. Creatures on the ground within a 20-foot emanation take damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 0), which they can resist with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. On a failure, they also fall [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). After you use this action, you can't use it again for `1d4` rounds.

**Special.** If you have this feat, the Dexterity modifier cap to your AC while using [Mountain Stance](mountain-stance.md) increases from +1 to +2.
