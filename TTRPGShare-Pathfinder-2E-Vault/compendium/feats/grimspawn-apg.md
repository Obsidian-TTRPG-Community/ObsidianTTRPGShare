# Grimspawn  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


Your lineage traces back to a [daemon](../../rules/traits/daemon-b1.md), one of the manifestations of horrific forms of death that devour souls within their foul home of Abaddon. As a result, you cling tenaciously to the last shreds of your own life force. You gain the [Diehard](diehard.md) feat.

## Grimspawn leads to...

[Daemon Magic](daemon-magic-apg.md)
