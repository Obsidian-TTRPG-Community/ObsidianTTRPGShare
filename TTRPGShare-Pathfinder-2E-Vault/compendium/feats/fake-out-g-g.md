# Fake Out  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Trigger** An ally is about to use an action that requires an attack roll, targeting a creature within your weapon's first range increment.
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Reaction

With a skilled flourish of your weapon, you force an enemy to acknowledge you as a threat. Make an attack roll to [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) the triggering attack. If you dealt damage to that enemy with the same weapon since the start of your last turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this roll.
