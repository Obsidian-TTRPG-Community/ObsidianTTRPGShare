# Cloud Gazer  *Feat 5*  
[sylph](../../rules/traits/sylph-b2.md)

You can see well enough through fog, mist, and clouds that would normally cause creatures to be [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) that you don't need to succeed at a flat check to target creatures benefiting from such concealment.
