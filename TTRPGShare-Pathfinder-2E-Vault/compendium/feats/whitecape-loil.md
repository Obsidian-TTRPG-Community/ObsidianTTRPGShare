# Whitecape  *Feat 1*  
[vanara](../../rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  


You're shorter and wider than many vanaras of your heritage, and the hair on your shoulders and your head is particularly thick and luxurious, like a majestic cape. This hair grows back supernaturally quickly if shorn. You gain the [Steady Balance](steady-balance.md) skill feat, even if you aren't trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), and you can [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) into difficult terrain caused by uneven ground.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of or into this feat.
