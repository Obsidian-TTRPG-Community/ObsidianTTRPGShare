> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to your Frightful Aura for 1 minute.
> - **Failure** The creature is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
