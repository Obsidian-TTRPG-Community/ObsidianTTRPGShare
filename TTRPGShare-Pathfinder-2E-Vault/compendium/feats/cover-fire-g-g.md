# Cover Fire  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Single Action

You lay down suppressive fire to protect allies by forcing foes to take cover from your wild attacks. Make a firearm or crossbow [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md); the target must decide before you roll your attack whether it will duck out of the way. If the target ducks, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against your attack, or a +4 circumstance bonus to AC if it has cover. It also takes a –2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls until the end of its next turn. If the target chooses not to duck, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll for that [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
