[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  electric  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wild Winds Initiate](wild-winds-initiate.md)
- **Trigger** You would take damage.
- **Requirements**: You are in Wild Winds stance.
- **Activity** Reaction

You gain resistance to electricity equal to your level until the start of your next turn. If the triggering damage was electricity, this resistance applies to it. If the triggering damage was from a melee attack, the attacker takes `3d6` electricity damage.

**Special.** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of ki spells you cast, either divine or occult.
