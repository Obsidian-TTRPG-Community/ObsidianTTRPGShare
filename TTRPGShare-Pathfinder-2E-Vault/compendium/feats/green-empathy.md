# Green Empathy  *Feat 6*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Leaf order

You can communicate with plants and fungus on a basic level and use [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on them and to make very simple [Requests](../../rules/actions/request.md) of them. Non-creature plants or fungus typically can't fulfill most requests you might ask of them unless you have access to other magic such as [speak with plants](../spells/speak-with-plants.md). Because of your affiliation with the leaf order, plants have a sense that you support them, so you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your check to [Make a Request](../../rules/actions/request.md) of a plant using Green Empathy.

## Green Empathy leads to...
