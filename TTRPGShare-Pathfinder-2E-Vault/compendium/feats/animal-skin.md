# Animal Skin  *Feat 6*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [instinct](../../rules/traits/instinct.md)  [morph](../../rules/traits/morph.md)  [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Animal instinct

Your proficiency in unarmored defense increases to expert. While you are raging and unarmored, your skin transforms into a thick hide resembling your animal's skin. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC instead of taking a –1 penalty to AC; if you have the greater juggernaut|Barbarian||13 class feature, this status bonus increases to +2. The thickness of your hide gives you a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +3.
