# Armiger's Mobility  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in heavy armor, [Hellknight Armiger Dedication](hellknight-armiger-dedication-lowg.md)

You've learned how best to move in heavy armor. When wearing heavy armor, if you meet the Strength requirement, instead of reducing the movement penalty by 5 feet, you reduce the penalty by 10 feet (typically reducing the penalty to 0). If you are a dwarf with the Unburdened Iron feat, increase your Speed by 5 feet.
