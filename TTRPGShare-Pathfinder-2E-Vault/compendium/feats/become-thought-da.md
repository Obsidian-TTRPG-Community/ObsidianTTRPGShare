# Become Thought  *Feat 20*  
[psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  


You shed some of your material form, becoming a being of pure thought. This has the following effects.

- You gain resistance 10 to physical damage but weakness 5 to mental damage and weakness 10 to [any](../../rules/traits/any-b1.md) effect that deals damage by targeting the spirit, such as spirit blast.
- You can change your appearance on a whim. This takes a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, has the effects of illusory disguise, and lasts until you change your appearance again.
- Once per year, when you die, you automatically return to life the next day as long as one living sentient creature on your plane remembers you; the memories enable you to reconstruct yourself from their thoughts. You appear in the vicinity of the creature that remembers you most strongly.
