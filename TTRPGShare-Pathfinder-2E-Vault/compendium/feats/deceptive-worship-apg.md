# Deceptive Worship  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism)

Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) instead of [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) to [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) a typical worshipper of another faith or to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) skill to [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) about any other matter.
