# Voice Cold as Death  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 7*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md), master in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Requirements**: You are not [fatigued](../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued).
- **Activity** Single Action

Channeling the energy of the Crimson Oath into your voice, you pronounce a threat in a tone so icy it freezes the blood. Attempt an [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md); you don't suffer a penalty if the target doesn't understand the language you're speaking, but this otherwise functions as normal. You can't use Intimidating Glare or any other effect that would cause your [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) attempt to lose the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) trait as part of using this feat. If you critically succeed at your [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check, the target becomes [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned), or [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) if the target is undead. After using this feat, you are [fatigued](../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) until the end of your next turn, and you can't use this feat again until the end of your next turn.
