# Coordinated Charge  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [open](../../rules/traits/open.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](marshal-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You heroically dash into the fray, inspiring your allies to follow. You [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed and make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).

If your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit can use a reaction to [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), but they each must end their [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) closer to the creature you hit than where they started.
