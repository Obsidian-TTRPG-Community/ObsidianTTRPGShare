# Reactive Pursuit  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Trigger** An adjacent foe moves away from you, and you can reach at least one space adjacent to the foe with a [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) action.
- **Activity** Reaction

You keep pace with a retreating foe. You [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), but you must end your movement adjacent to the triggering enemy. Your move does not trigger reactions from the triggering enemy. You can use Reactive Pursuit to [Burrow](../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
