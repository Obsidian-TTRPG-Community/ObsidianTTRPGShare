# Taste Blood  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[dhampir](../../rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cel Rau](cel-rau-loag.md), [Straveika](straveika-apg.md), [Svetocher](svetocher-apg.md), or another lineage from a vampire with the Drink Blood ability
- **Activity** Single Action

You retain not only your vampiric parent's taste for blood but their ability to gain vitality from it. You drink fresh blood from a living humanoid creature, gaining temporary Hit Points equal to the target's level that last for 10 minutes. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or become [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained). Regardless of the outcome of this save, the target is temporarily immune to your Taste Blood for 1 day; further uses of this ability against the target don't increase the [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition or grant you more temporary Hit Points.

To drink a creature's blood, either your last action must have been a fangs [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that damaged the target, or the target must be [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) or [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and your last action must have been a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that dealt piercing or slashing damage to them.

If the target is willing, they don't need to be [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) or [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for the latter.

Draining the life force from an unwilling humanoid creature is a greater violation than just drinking their blood. Taste Blood has the [evil](../../rules/traits/evil.md) trait unless the target is willing or is an active foe in combat.
