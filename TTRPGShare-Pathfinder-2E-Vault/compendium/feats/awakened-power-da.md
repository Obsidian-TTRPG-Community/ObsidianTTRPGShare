# Awakened Power  *Feat 4*  
[deviant](../../rules/traits/deviant-da.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  


Your power spontaneously evolves or reconfigures itself. You gain one awakening benefit for a deviant feat of 4th level or lower.

**Special.** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a different deviant feat of 4th level or lower, and gain one of its awakening benefits.
