# Guiding Luck  *Feat 9*  
[halfling](../../rules/traits/halfling.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Halfling Luck](halfling-luck.md)

Your luck guides you to look the right way and aim your blows unerringly. You can use Halfling Luck twice per day: once in response to its normal trigger, and once when you fail a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check or attack roll instead of the normal trigger.
