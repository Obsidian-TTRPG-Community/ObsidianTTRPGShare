# Cel Rau  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](../../rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


You are a cel rau, child of a strigoi, one of the first vampires to walk Golarion. Your heritage ties you to the Shadow Plane and grants you strange resilience to light and darkness alike. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects with the [darkness](../../rules/traits/darkness.md), [light](../../rules/traits/light.md), or [shadow](../../rules/traits/shadow.md) traits, and whenever you become [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) or [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for at least 2 rounds, you can reduce the duration by 1 round.

## Cel Rau leads to...
