# Corpse Stench  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [aura](../../rules/traits/aura.md)  [olfactory](../../rules/traits/olfactory-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghoul Dedication](ghoul-dedication-botd.md)

Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10-foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) (plus [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.
