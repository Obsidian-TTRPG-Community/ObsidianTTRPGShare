# Settlement Scholastics  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archaeologist Dedication](archaeologist-dedication-apg.md)

Your studies open up new horizons. You become an expert in a [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill about a specific settlement; if you were already trained in that [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill, you also become trained in the [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill for a different settlement of your choice. Choose a single common or uncommon language prevalent in that settlement. You learn that language.

**Special.** You can take this feat multiple times. When you take this feat again, choose a different settlement.
