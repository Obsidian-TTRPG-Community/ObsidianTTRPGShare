# Killing Stone  *Feat 13*  
[kitsune](../../rules/traits/kitsune-loag.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Star Orb](star-orb-loag.md)

Your star orb hides a deadly miasma. You can cast 5th-level [cloudkill](../spells/cloudkill.md) as a divine innate spell once per day. The spell's normal components are replaced with a focus component (your star orb) and a somatic component to aim the orb towards the location for the spell.
