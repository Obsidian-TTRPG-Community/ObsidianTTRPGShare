# Gnoll Lore  *Feat 1*  
[gnoll](../../rules/traits/gnoll-b1.md)  


You paid attention to your senior hunters to learn their tricks. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) and [Survival](../skills.md#Survival). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Gnoll Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
