# Lunging Spellstrike  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md), twisting tree hybrid study
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a staff.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your spell unwinds the structure of your staff to make it exceptionally long, or even separate it into shards held together by magical power. Make a [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) with a staff, with a spell that isn't a cantrip or focus spell. Increase the staff's reach by 5 feet × the spell's level.
