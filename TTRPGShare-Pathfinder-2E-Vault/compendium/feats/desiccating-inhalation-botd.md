# Desiccating Inhalation  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](mummy-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Two-Action

You draw in the moisture from nearby creatures, draining them dry to heal your wounds. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take `6d8` negative damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails this saving throw is also [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained). As long as at least one creature was damaged by your Desiccating Inhalation, you regain HP equal to your level.

At 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by `1d8`.
