# Vitality-manipulating Stance  *Feat 20*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Stunning Fist](stunning-fist.md)

You have learned to attack meridians and pressure points like your rival Shino Hakusa. You gain a vitality blast ranged unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that deals `1d4` negative damage, has a range of 30 feet, and has the unarmed and versatile [positive](../../rules/traits/positive.md) traits.

Additionally, when you use Stunning Fist, instead of saving against being [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned), you can choose to have the target make a Fortitude save against your class DC with the following results. You must choose to do this before the target rolls its save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target's muscles become temporarily weaker. For 1 round, the target is [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), and any time it attempts to take an action with the [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, the action is disrupted unless it succeeds at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + its [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) value.
> - **Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute, the flat check is DC 11, and the target takes –10-foot status penalty to all Speeds for the duration.
