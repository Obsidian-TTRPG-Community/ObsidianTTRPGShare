# Legendary Thief  *Feat 15*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery), [Pickpocket](pickpocket.md)

Your ability to [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md) defies belief. You can attempt to [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md) something that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute (and significantly longer for items that are normally time consuming to remove, like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden), such as the cover of darkness or a bustling crowd. You take a –5 penalty to your [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent—like a suit of [full plate](../equipment/items/full-plate.md) armor—onlookers will quickly notice it's gone after you steal it.
