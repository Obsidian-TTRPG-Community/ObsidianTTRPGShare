# Rough Rider  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](../../rules/traits/goblin.md)  


You are especially good at riding traditional goblin mounts. You gain the [Ride](ride.md) feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) checks to use [Command an Animal](../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) on a goblin dog or wolf mount. You can always select a wolf as your animal companion, even if you would usually select an animal companion with the mount special ability, such as for a champion's steed ally.
