# Mariner's Fire  *Feat 1*  
[tengu](../../rules/traits/tengu-b1.md)  


You conjure uncanny orbs of spiritual flame that float above or below the water's surface. You can cast the [produce flame](../spells/produce-flame.md) cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You can cast this cantrip underwater.
