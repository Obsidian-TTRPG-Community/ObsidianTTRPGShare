# Call Of Elysium  *Feat 9*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Musetouched](musetouched-apg.md)

The wild wonder of Elysium harmonizes within you, and in dire straits, you can share its benefits with your allies. Your Speed increases by 5 feet; the Speed increase from this feat isn't cumulative with any Speed increase from your ancestry feats (such as Nimble Elf). Allies who begin their turn in combat adjacent to you gain a +5-foot status bonus to their Speed for the round.
