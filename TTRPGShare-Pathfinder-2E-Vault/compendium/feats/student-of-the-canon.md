# Student Of The Canon  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)

You've researched many faiths enough to recognize notions about them that are unlikely to be true. If you roll a critical failure at a [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) check to [Decipher Writing](../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md) of a religious nature or to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the tenets of faiths, you get a failure instead. When attempting to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the tenets of your own faith, if you roll a failure, you get a success instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
