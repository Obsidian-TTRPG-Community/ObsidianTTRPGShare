# Halo  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  


You are surrounded by a halo of light and goodness at all times. Your halo sheds light with the effects of a divine [light](../spells/light.md) cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You can suppress or reestablish the halo with a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait.

## Halo leads to...

[Healer's Halo](healers-halo-loag.md)
