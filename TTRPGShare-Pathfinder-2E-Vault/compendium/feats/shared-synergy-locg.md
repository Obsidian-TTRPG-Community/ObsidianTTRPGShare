# Shared Synergy  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dualistic Synergy](dualistic-synergy-locg.md)

You can grant the benefit from Dualistic Synergy to an ally within 30 feet instead of yourself, either allowing that ally to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), granting that ally temporary Hit Points, or both, depending on the spell's tradition.
