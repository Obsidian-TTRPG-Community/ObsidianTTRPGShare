# Clan Pistol  *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

Raised in the ancient halls of Dongun Hold or the surrounding region, you display your lineage with a clan pistol, rather than a clan dagger. You get one clan pistol of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. This replaces your clan dagger. Selling this pistol is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of other dwarves. You are trained with the clan pistol. In addition, when your clan pistol is visible, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on checks to [Gather Information](../../rules/actions/gather-information.md) or [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) when interacting with citizens of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or their allies.
