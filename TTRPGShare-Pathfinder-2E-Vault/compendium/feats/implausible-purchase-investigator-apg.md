# Implausible Purchase (Investigator)  *Feat 16*  
[investigator](../../rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Predictive Purchase

It seems impossible, but you've analyzed every angle and are able to just keep pulling out exactly the item you need, even in far-flung locations. You can use [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md) even if you have already used it after purchasing goods, and you can use it as a single action instead of a 2-action activity, during which you [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw the item. In addition, five times per day, you can use [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md) to pull out a common consumable item up to 6 levels lower than your level.
