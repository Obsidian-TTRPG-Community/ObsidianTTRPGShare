# Disorienting Opening  *Feat 8*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Attack of Opportunity](../../rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md)

You use your foes' openings to expose even greater weaknesses. When you hit a creature as part of an [Attack of Opportunity](../../rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md), that creature becomes [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn.
