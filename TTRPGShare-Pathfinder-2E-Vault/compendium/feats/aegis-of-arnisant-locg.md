# Aegis Of Arnisant  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Vigilant Dedication](knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md), [Shield Block](shield-block.md), master in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a shield.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Inspired by the tale of Arnisant, you transform your shield into a magic ward. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain the following reaction:

```ad-embed-ability
title: Absorb into the Aegis [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Trigger**: An enemy casts a spell that targets you or an ally within 15 feet of you.

**Effect** You interpose your shield's ward against the spell. Attempt a counteract check, using your [Religion](../../../compendium/skills.md#Religion) modifier as your counteract modifier. On a success, the spell is counteracted and your shield takes damage equal to four times the spell level as it absorbs and disperses the magical energy. On a failure, the shield takes damage equal to twice the spell's level.
