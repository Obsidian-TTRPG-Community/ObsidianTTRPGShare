# Staff Acrobat Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Dexterity 16; trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics); trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics); trained with at least one of the following weapons: staff, bo staff, halfling sling staff, or any weapon in the spear or polearm (referred to in this archetype as "your staff")

When you [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md), [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md), or [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) while wielding your staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check required and add 5 feet to the distance you can [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) vertically and horizontally. You can [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) and [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) even if you don't have a free hand, provided you are wielding your staff. Finally, when you roll a success on a check to [Balance](../../rules/actions/balance.md) while wielding your staff, you get a critical success instead.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the staff acrobat archetype.
