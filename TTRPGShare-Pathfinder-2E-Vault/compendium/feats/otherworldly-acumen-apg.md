# Otherworldly Acumen  *Feat 9*  
[elf](../../rules/traits/elf.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: at least one innate spell gained from an elf ancestry feat

The arcane magic you possess grows in power and complexity. Choose one common 2nd-level spell from the same tradition as an innate spell you previously gained from another elf ancestry feat (from the arcane list if you have [Otherworldly Magic](otherworldly-magic.md), for example). You can cast that spell as an innate spell once per day, using the same tradition as the list you chose the spell from.
