# Clockwork Celerity  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [unstable](../../rules/traits/unstable-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: armor, construct, or weapon innovation
- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You can use unstable clockwork devices in your innovation to push your invention to act more quickly. You are [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) for this turn. How you can use the extra action depends on your innovation.

- **Armor** You can use the extra action to [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md), [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), or use another movement action granted by your innovation (such as [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md) if you have the Diving Armor feat).
- **Construct** You can use the extra action to Command your construct innovation (or to provide 1 of the actions if you spend 2 actions to Command your construct).
- **Weapon** You can use the extra action to [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your innovation or Reload your innovation.
