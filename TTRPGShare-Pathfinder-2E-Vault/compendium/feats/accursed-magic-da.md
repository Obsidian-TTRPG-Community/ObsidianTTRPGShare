# Accursed Magic  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Curse Maelstrom Dedication](curse-maelstrom-dedication-da.md)

When the curse within you spills out, you can lay curses on others and claim them for yourself with ease. You can cast [claim curse](../spells/claim-curse-som.md) (Secrets of Magic 95). At 10th level, you can also cast [seal fate](../spells/seal-fate-apg.md) (Advanced Player's Guide 224), and at 12th level, you can also cast [inevitable disaster](../spells/inevitable-disaster-som.md) (Secrets of Magic 111). You can cast these spells once per day as occult innate spells, but only while within your curse maelstrom state.

If you couldn't already cast occult spells, these spells use Wisdom as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
