# Ancestor's Transformation  *Feat 13*  
[strix](../../rules/traits/strix-loag.md)  


You can commune with ancestor spirits to assume the form of an enormous primeval strix. You can cast 5th-level [aerial form](../spells/aerial-form.md) as a primal innate spell once per day, but you take the form of a primeval strix, using the statistics for a bird form.
