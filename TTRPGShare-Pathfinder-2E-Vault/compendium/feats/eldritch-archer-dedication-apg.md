# Eldritch Archer Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in at least one type of bow

You blend magic with your archery, leading to powerful results.

If you don't already cast spells from spell slots, you learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity. You gain a spell repertoire with one cantrip of your choice, from a spell list of your choice. You choose this cantrip from the common spells on your chosen spell list or from other spells to which you have access on that list. This cantrip must require a spell attack roll. You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for that tradition. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.

You also gain Eldritch Shot.

title: Eldritch Shot [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a bow

**Effect** You [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into the bow you're wielding. Make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with that bow. Your spell flies with the ammunition, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the penalty until after you've completed both attacks.
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the eldritch archer archetype.
