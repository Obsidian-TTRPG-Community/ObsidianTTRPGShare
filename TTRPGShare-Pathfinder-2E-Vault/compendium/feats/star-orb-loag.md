# Star Orb  *Feat 1*  
[kitsune](../../rules/traits/kitsune-loag.md)  


Your magic has crystallized into a spherical stone. You gain a familiar, except it's a star orb: a Tiny stone of light Bulk. The familiar has no Speeds and must select a Speed familiar ability before it can move, animating in a way appropriate to the chosen Speed and using the statistics of a normal familiar for that day; when it's an immobile stone, it can't select any familiar or master abilities that require it to move. It always has the innate surge master ability, which counts against your limit for familiar and master abilities.
