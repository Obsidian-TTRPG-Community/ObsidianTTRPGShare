# Bizarre Transformation  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Wild Shape
- **Activity** Single Action

The forms you take on defy belief—chimerical sights of twisted antlers or acidic drool. If your next action is to cast [wild shape](../spells/wild-shape.md), you can change the damage type of a single unarmed attack granted by the wild shape form to one of the following: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, poison, piercing, or slashing.

The chosen attack gains the appropriate trait.
