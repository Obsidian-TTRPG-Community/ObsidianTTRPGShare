# Quill Spray  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 9*  
[shisk](../../rules/traits/shisk-lome.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: quillcoat shisk or quill unarmed attack
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You can launch a mass of quills at opponents. You spray quills in a 30-foot cone, dealing `5d8` piercing damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. On a critical failure, a creature also takes 5 [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). At 11th level and every even level thereafter, the piercing damage increases by `1d8` and the [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1.
