# Enduring Quickness  *Feat 20*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  


You move as fast and as high as the wind itself. You're permanently [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened). You can use your extra action to [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md), or to provide one of the actions needed for a [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md).
