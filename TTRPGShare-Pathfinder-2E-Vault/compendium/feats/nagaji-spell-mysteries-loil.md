- **Prerequisites**: at least one innate spell from a nagaji heritage or ancestry feat

You've learned more naga magic. During your daily preparations, choose [charm](../spells/charm.md), [fleet step](../spells/fleet-step.md), or [heal](../spells/heal.md). You can cast the chosen spell as a 1st-level occult innate spell once that day.
