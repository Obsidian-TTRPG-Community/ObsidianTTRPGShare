# Gemsoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [oread](../../rules/traits/oread-b2.md)  


The earth inside you asserts itself as crystallized gemstones or metals, like a cluster of quartz or veins of iron and gold. This shimmering presence inside your being inspires you to flashy and flamboyant performances. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance). If you would automatically become trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [Impressive Performance](impressive-performance.md) skill feat.
