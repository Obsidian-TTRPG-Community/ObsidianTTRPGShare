If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from your spell slots, you gain a benefit. If the spell is arcane, you can attempt a skill check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) with a +1 status bonus to the check after casting the spell, or a +2 status bonus if the spell is 7th level or higher. If the spell is primal, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's level for 1 round. If the spell is a halcyon spell, you gain both benefits.

## Dualistic Synergy leads to...

[Fulminating Synergy](fulminating-synergy-locg.md), [Synergistic Spell](synergistic-spell-locg.md), [Shared Synergy](shared-synergy-locg.md)
