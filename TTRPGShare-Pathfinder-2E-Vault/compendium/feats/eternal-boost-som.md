# Eternal Boost  *Feat 20*  
[summoner](../../rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  


Your link with your eidolon is so intense that you continuously reinforce its abilities. You are permanently [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened); you can use your extra action only to cast [boost eidolon](../spells/boost-eidolon-som.md) or [reinforce eidolon](../spells/reinforce-eidolon-som.md). While in exploration mode, you can declare that you are also continually casting [boost eidolon](../spells/boost-eidolon-som.md) or [reinforce eidolon](../spells/reinforce-eidolon-som.md) even while using a different exploration activity. If you do, even before your first turn in a combat encounter, that cantrip is active as if you had cast it on your previous turn.
