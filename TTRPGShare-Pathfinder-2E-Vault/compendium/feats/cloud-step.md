# Cloud Step  *Feat 16*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics)

Using fantastic acrobatic skill, you can walk for brief stretches across insubstantial surfaces. When you [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), you can move across water, air, and solid surfaces that can hold only limited weight as if they were normal ground. If you [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) over a trap with a weight-sensitive pressure plate, you don't trigger it. At the end of your turn, you sink, fall, break fragile surfaces, or trigger traps as normal for your current location.
