# Radiate Glory  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 17*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [light](../../rules/traits/light.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Your inherent glory radiates into the world with all the divine power of the celestial planes for 1 minute.

Any creature that can see you while you Radiate Glory must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** You are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to the creature for 1 round by the shining light, but can't use this concealment to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md), as normal for when your location is obvious.
> - **Failure** As success, except you are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to the creature while your glory radiates.
> - **Critical Failure** You are [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to the creature while your glory radiates, lost amid the radiant corona of your presence. Your general position is still obvious, so you can't use this to [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md).
