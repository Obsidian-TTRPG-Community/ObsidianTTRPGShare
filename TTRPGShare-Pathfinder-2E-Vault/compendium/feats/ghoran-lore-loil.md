# Ghoran Lore  *Feat 1*  
[ghoran](../../rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md)  


The very first memories ghorans have are those of their creation, and even after thousands of years, those memories have never faded for you. You become trained in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) and [Nature](../skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Ghoran Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
