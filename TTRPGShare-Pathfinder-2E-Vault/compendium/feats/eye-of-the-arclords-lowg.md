# Eye Of The Arclords  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are a member of the Arclords of Nex.
- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana), [Arcane Sense](arcane-sense.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You open an incandescent third eye upon your forehead. The eye can remain open for 1 minute, and you can close it before then with a single action with the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. It can remain open for 2 minutes if you're a master in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana), or 5 minutes if you're legendary. While the eye is open, you gain the following benefits: you gain the effects of the detect magic arcane innate spell from your Arcane Sense at the start of each of your turns without needing to cast the spell; you gain [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md); you gain a +2 status bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) and [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creatures and to your [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC against [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md). After your third eye closes, you are [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for an amount of time equal to how long you had it open.
