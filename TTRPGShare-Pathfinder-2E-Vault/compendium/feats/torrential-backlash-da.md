# Torrential Backlash  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Curse Maelstrom Dedication](curse-maelstrom-dedication-da.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in a curse maelstrom state.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Calling upon forbidden practices, you release the curse from within yourself, allowing it free rein to destroy everything around you. All creatures within your curse maelstrom emanation except you take `1d6` negative damage for each level you have, with a basic Fortitude save. Your curse maelstrom state then ends.
