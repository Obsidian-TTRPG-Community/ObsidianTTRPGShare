# Skyseeker  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Sky and Heaven Stance
- **Requirements**: You're in Sky and Heaven Stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) toward an opponent. At any point in the [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md), you can make a single [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature within your reach. At 12th level, if you hit with this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), instead of finishing your [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md), you can immediately attempt a second [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) from the space where you struck the target of your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). You can make a single [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a target within your reach during this second [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) as well. At 16th level, you can attempt a third [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) if your second [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits, and you can attack a target at any point during this third [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md). All Leaps made during this activity gain a +10-foot status bonus to the total height or distance of your leap, and no two Strikes can target the same creature.
