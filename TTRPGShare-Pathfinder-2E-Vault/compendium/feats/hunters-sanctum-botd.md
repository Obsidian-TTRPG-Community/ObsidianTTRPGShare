# Hunter's Sanctum  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Slayer Dedication](undead-slayer-dedication-botd.md)

You establish a safe house where you can prepare for your hunt. The sanctum is roughly the size of a 20-foot cube. This sanctum is in a location you have access to and can be part of a larger structure, such as the basement of a temple or hidden room of a library. Setting up or moving your sanctum takes a week of downtime. Your sanctum protects objects and people inside it from magical detection and the prying eyes of undead. This has the effects of nondetection, using your [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Additionally, undead attempting to locate the entrance to your sanctum via mundane [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) must succeed against either your [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) DC or the normal DC to find the sanctum, whichever is higher.
