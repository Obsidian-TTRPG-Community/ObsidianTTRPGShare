You leap from the shadows to strike your foes. [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, then [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) twice. If you were [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [unnoticed](../../rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) by the target of these [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md), your foe is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against both attacks.
