# Crane Flutter  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Crane Stance](crane-stance.md)
- **Trigger** You are targeted with a melee attack by an attacker you can see.
- **Requirements**: You are in Crane Stance.
- **Activity** Reaction

You interpose your arm between yourself and your opponent. Your circumstance bonus to AC from Crane Stance increases to +3 against the triggering attack. If the attack misses you, you can immediately make a crane wing [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the attacker at a –2 penalty, even if the attacker isn't within your reach.
