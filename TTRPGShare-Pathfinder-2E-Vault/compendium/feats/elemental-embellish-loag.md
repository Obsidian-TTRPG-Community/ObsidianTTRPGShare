# Elemental Embellish  *Feat 1*  
[suli](../../rules/traits/suli-b2.md)  


You can summon a harmless but impressive elemental display. You become trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation). If you would automatically become trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

When you [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) a foe, if you choose to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) via an elemental display, [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) loses the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) trait and gains the [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) a creature that doesn't understand your language.
