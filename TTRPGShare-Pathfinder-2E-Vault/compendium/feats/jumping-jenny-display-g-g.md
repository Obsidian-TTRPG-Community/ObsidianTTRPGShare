# Jumping Jenny Display  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Firework Technician Dedication](firework-technician-dedication-g-g.md)

This multi-sequence rocket blasts confetti at a series of altitudes. While the design is intended to delight children of all ages, you've found it has an unexpected side effect of confounding enemy fliers. You gain the Jumping Jenny fireworks display.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Jumping Jenny [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Cost**: 2 batches of infused reagents

Target a flying creature within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, each time that creature attempts to [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md), they must succeed at an [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Maneuver in Flight](../../../rules/actions/maneuver-in-flight.md) against the DC of your fireworks display, or the [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md) action is disrupted. If all the creature's attempts to [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md) are disrupted, at the end of its turn, it falls harmlessly to the ground below. A jumping jenny costs 2 batches of infused reagents, rather than 1.
