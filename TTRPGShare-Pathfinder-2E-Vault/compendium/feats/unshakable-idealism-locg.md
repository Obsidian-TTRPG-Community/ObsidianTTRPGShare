# Unshakable Idealism  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Vigilant Dedication](knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md), expert in Will saves

Your faith and hope can't be shaken, and you won't flee when lives are at stake. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effects and [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effects that inflict despair. When you would gain the [fleeing](../../rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) condition, you can choose to stand your ground and be [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for the effect's duration as well, preventing you from running and allowing you to re-enter the fight more quickly when the effect ends.
