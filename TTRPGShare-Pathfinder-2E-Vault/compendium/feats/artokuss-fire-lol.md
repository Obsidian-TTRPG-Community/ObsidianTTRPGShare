# Artokus's Fire  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[additive <2>](../../rules/traits/additive.md)  [alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Trigger** You use [Quick Alchemy](../../rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) to craft an alchemist's fire, and that bomb's level is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

Artokus developed a mixture of volatile materials that burns hotter and longer than typical alchemist's fire. You include this additive mixture when crafting your alchemist's fire. The alchemist's fire deals `1d4` [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) in addition to what the alchemist fire would normally cause (for instance, a moderate alchemist's fire deals `1d4+2` [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage))

A creature taking [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from the alchemist's fire requires two successful flat checks to end the [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), or one check if the creature had an assisted recovery that reduces the flat check to DC 10. The enhanced alchemist's fire burns even underwater, and any attempts to end the [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) by using water have no effect.
