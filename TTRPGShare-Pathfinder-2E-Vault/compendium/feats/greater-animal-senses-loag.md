# Greater Animal Senses  *Feat 5*  
[beastkin](../../rules/traits/beastkin-loag.md)  


Your senses advance to match those of your animal aspect. You gain one of the following senses available to your inherent animal: echolocation (imprecise) 30 feet or [tremorsense](../../rules/abilities/tremorsense.md) (imprecise) 30 feet. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a specific type of sense, you can't gain the sense with this feat.

**Special.** You can select this feat multiple times, either choosing a different sense or improving an imprecise sense granted by this feat to a precise sense.
