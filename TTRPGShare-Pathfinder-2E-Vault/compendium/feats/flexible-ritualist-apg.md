# Flexible Ritualist  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ritualist Dedication](ritualist-dedication-apg.md)

You can perform two aspects of a ritual yourself. When you cast a ritual, you can reduce the number of secondary casters by 1.

When you do, you must fulfill any requirements for the secondary caster, and you attempt the secondary check normally performed by that secondary caster. You can't replace a secondary caster who is the target of the spell (as in the atone ritual).

## Flexible Ritualist leads to...

[Assured Ritualist](assured-ritualist-apg.md)
