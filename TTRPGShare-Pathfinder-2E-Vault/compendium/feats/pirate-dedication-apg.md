# Pirate Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation)

As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder. You become trained in [Sailing Lore](../skills.md#Lore), or become an expert in it if you were already trained. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by a ship's movement. Additionally, you gain the Boarding Assault action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Boarding Assault [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")
[flourish](../../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  

Either [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) twice or attempt an [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) check (DC determined by the GM, but usually DC 20) to swing on a rope up to twice your Speed. If you boarded or disembarked from a boat or similar vehicle during this movement, you can make a melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) that deals one additional weapon damage die.  
%% #trait/flourish %%
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the pirate archetype.
