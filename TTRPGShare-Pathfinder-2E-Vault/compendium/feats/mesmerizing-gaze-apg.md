# Mesmerizing Gaze  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Celebrity Dedication](celebrity-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

When you meet someone's gaze, they are unable to look away. Choose one target creature. That creature must succeed at a Will save or be [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) until the end of your next turn; the DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the creature succeeds at its save or its fascination ends due to a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, it becomes temporarily immune to your Mesmerizing Gaze for 1 day.

When you select this feat, it gains either the [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md) or [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md) trait; once you make this choice, you can't change it.
