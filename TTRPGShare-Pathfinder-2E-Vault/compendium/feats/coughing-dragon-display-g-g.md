# Coughing Dragon Display  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Firework Technician Dedication](firework-technician-dedication-g-g.md)

This display emits a cascade of loud bangs or glittering trails. While you initially designed the display to captivate your audience's attention, it turns out to have a surprisingly effective use in combat, suppressing [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) effects behind your magnificent display. You gain the Coughing Dragon fireworks display.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Coughing Dragon [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

- **Cost**: 2 batches of infused reagents

Choose either [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md) effects. The display gains that trait, and you attempt to counteract one or more effects within 60 feet that have this trait. On a success, the effect is suppressed until the start of your next turn, rather than ending entirely. Use your [Fireworks Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) modifier as your counteract modifier, and your counteract level is equal to half your advanced alchemy level (rounded up). A coughing dragon costs 2 batches of infused reagents rather than 1, but you can increase the cost to 3 batches and spend an additional action to create an even bigger coughing dragon display that attempts to counteract both [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) and [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md) effects at the same time.
