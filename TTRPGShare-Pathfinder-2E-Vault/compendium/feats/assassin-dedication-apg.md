# Assassin Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alchemical Crafting](alchemical-crafting.md); trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), and [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)

You've trained to assassinate your foes, and you do so with tenacity and precision. You gain the Mark for Death activity.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Mark for Death [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

- **Requirements**: You can see and hear the creature you intend to mark

**Effect** You designate a single creature as your mark. This lasts until the mark dies or you use Mark for Death again. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) your mark and on [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md) against your mark. Your [agile](../../../rules/traits/agile.md) and [finesse](../../../rules/traits/finesse.md) weapons and unarmed attacks gain the [backstabber](../../../rules/traits/backstabber.md) and [deadly <d6>](../../../rules/traits/deadly.md) weapon traits when you're attacking your mark.

If the weapon or unarmed attack already has the [deadly](../../../rules/traits/deadly.md) trait, increase the size of the deadly damage die by one step instead of giving it [deadly <d6>](../../../rules/traits/deadly.md).
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the assassin archetype.

## Assassin Dedication leads to...

[Angel Of Death](angel-of-death-apg.md), [Assassinate](assassinate-apg.md), [Expert Backstabber](expert-backstabber-apg.md), [Surprise Attack](surprise-attack-apg.md), [Angel of Vindication](angel-of-vindication-lokl.md), [Eclipsed Vitality](eclipsed-vitality-lokl.md)
