# Elude The Divine  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bright Lion Dedication](bright-lion-dedication-lol.md)

You are able to escape inquisitions involving divine magic, allowing you to blend in well in Mzali but also to avoid unwanted attention in other oppressive theocracies. You gain the [Slippery Secrets](slippery-secrets.md) skill feat, and its benefits also apply against [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md) effects that attempt to discern your deity. When using Slippery Secrets against a divine divination, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and on a critical success, the divination reveals false information appropriate to your false persona, rather than nothing.
