# False Faith  *Feat 1*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: worshipper of [Droskar](../setting/deities/droskar-logm.md)

[Droskar](../setting/deities/droskar-logm.md) knows you may need to disguise yourself in societies that oppose your faith. After spending 1 hour in prayer to [Droskar](../setting/deities/droskar-logm.md), you can cast spells using the religious symbol of a different deity as your divine focus, and you can address verbal prayers to that deity. [Droskar](../setting/deities/droskar-logm.md) intercepts your prayers and answers them without the named god knowing.

This ability applies to the religious symbol of only one god at a time—making a different religious symbol work in this fashion requires another hour of prayer and causes the old one to cease functioning. You can always use a religious symbol of [Droskar](../setting/deities/droskar-logm.md) without affecting this ability.
