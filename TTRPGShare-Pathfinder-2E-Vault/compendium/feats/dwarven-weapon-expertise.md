# Dwarven Weapon Expertise  *Feat 13*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dwarven Weapon Familiarity](dwarven-weapon-familiarity.md)

Your dwarven affinity blends with your training, granting you great skill with dwarven weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency for [battle axes](../equipment/items/battle-axe.md), [picks](../equipment/items/pick.md), [warhammers](../equipment/items/warhammer.md), and all dwarven weapons in which you are trained.
