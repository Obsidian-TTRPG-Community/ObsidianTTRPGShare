[ifrit](../../rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** An effect would deal fire damage to you, even if you resist all the damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

You harness the oncoming flames and twist them into a screen of heat and smoke, granting you concealment until the beginning of your next turn.
