# Sky And Heaven Stance  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication](jalmeri-heavenseeker-dedication-aoe2.md)
- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a stance perfected by past champions of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven, allowing you to make jagged strikes like flashes of lightning through the sky. The only [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are skyward slash unarmed attacks. These unarmed attacks deal `1d10` slashing damage; are in the brawling; and have the [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md), and [versatile <P>](../../rules/traits/versatile.md) traits.

While in Sky and Heaven Stance, you gain resistance 2 to electricity and resistance 2 to sonic damage. These resistances increase to 5 at 12th level and to 8 at 18th level.

## Sky And Heaven Stance leads to...

[Cross The Final Horizon](cross-the-final-horizon-aoe2.md), [Skyseeker](skyseeker-aoe2.md)
