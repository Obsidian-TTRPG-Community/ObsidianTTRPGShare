# Shared Prey  *Feat 14*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Double Prey](double-prey.md), [Warden's Boon](wardens-boon.md)

Hunting as a duo, you and your ally both single out your prey. When you use [Hunt Prey](../../rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) and select only one prey, you can grant your [Hunt Prey](../../rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) benefits and hunter's edge to an ally in addition to gaining them yourself. The ally retains these benefits until you use [Hunt Prey](../../rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) again.

## Shared Prey leads to...

[Triple Threat](triple-threat.md)
