# Terrain Stalker  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)

Select one type of difficult terrain from the following list: rubble, snow, or underbrush. While [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by all non-allies in that type of terrain, you can [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) without attempting a [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check as long as you move no more than 5 feet and do not move within 10 feet of an enemy at any point during your movement. This also allows you to automatically approach creatures to within 15 feet while [Avoiding Notice](../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) during exploration as long as they aren't actively [Searching](../../rules/actions/search.md) or on guard.

**Special.** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different type of terrain.
