# Spell Relay  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Trigger** An ally [Casts a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) and you are within that spell's range.
- **Activity** Reaction

You open the power in your blood to your ally's spellcasting, using your magic to boost their range. Your ally can use you as the point of origin for their spell, calculating range and cover from your space instead of their own.
