# Miracle Worker  *Feat 18*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Frequency**: once every minute

Your alchemical mastery can resuscitate the recently slain. You can administer a true elixir of life to a creature who has been dead for no more than 2 rounds. When you do, that creature is immediately returned to life with 1 Hit Point and becomes [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded).
