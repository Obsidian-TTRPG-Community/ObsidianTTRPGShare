# Grippli Glide  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[grippli](../../rules/traits/grippli-b2.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: windweb grippli
- **Requirements**: You must have at least one hand free.
- **Activity** Single Action

You can use your webbed feet to guide your fall. You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down (10 feet if you don't have both hands free) and up to 25 feet forward through the air. As long as you spend at least 1 action gliding each round and have not yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn.
