- **Prerequisites**: [Tempest-Sun Redirection](tempest-sun-redirection-locg.md)
- **Trigger** You or an ally within 30 feet takes damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

You transform unrealized spell energy into a protective shield. If you're a spontaneous spellcaster, expend a spell slot; if you're a prepared spellcaster, expend a spell prepared in a spell slot. Reduce the triggering damage by an amount equal to four times the level of the expended slot or spell.
