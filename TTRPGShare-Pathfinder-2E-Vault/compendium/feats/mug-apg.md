[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a quick attack and rob your foe in the process. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against an adjacent foe. If you hit and deal sneak attack damage, you can also attempt to [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md) from the target, even if the target is in combat.
