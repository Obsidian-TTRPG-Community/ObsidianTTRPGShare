# Ghost Strike  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Hunter Dedication](ghost-hunter-dedication-av1.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

Once per day, you can infuse a weapon you are carrying with magical energies that allow it to strike true against incorporeal undead. The weapon gains the effects of the [ghost touch](../equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) property rune for 10 minutes.

At 10th level, you can apply this effect to two weapons instead of one.
