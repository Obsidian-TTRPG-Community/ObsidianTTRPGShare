# Quickened Casting (Sorcerer)  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 10*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Free Action

In a mentally strenuous process, you modify your casting of a spell to take less time. If your next action is to cast a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest level sorcerer spell you can cast, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
