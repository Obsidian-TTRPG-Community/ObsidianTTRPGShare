# Disrupt Prey  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Trigger** Your hunted prey is within your reach, and it uses a [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) action, uses a [move](../../rules/traits/move.md) action, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity** Reaction

Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against your prey. If the attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the triggering action.
