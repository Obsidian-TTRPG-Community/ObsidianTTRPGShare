# Daywalker  *Feat 6*  
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vampire Dedication](vampire-dedication-botd.md)

Through a profane pledge or a bloodline quirk, you can tolerate the sun's light. You gain the advanced undead benefits (page 44) and can't be destroyed by sunlight. This doesn't prevent you from becoming [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) by exposure to the sun.
