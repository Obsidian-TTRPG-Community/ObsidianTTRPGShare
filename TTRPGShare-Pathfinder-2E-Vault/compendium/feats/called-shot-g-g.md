# Called Shot  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  [gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You target a specific area of your foe's anatomy to debilitating effect. Declare a part of your foe's anatomy to target and make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and deal damage, the target takes one of the following effects, based on the body part you targeted. The GM should use the stated effects as a guideline when attacking creatures with stranger anatomy—for instance, applying the "arms" effect to a creature's tentacles if those are what the creature uses to attack.

- **Arms** The target is [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it's also [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute.
- **Head** The target is [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it's also [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute.
- **Legs** The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it also takes a –5-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute.
- **Wings** If the target is flying using its wings, it immediately falls 20 feet, or 40 feet on a critical hit. The fall is gradual enough that if the target hits the ground, it takes no damage from the fall.
