# Hydraulic Maneuvers  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*  
[azarketi](../../rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [water](../../rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your surroundings. If the next action you take is an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md), that action has a range of 15 feet. You don't receive any item bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body, but if you roll a critical failure on that [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check, you get a failure instead.
