# Trick Driver Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You are equally at home piloting any vehicle, adapting yourself instantly to varied controls, movements, and handling.

Whenever piloting a vehicle requires a [Piloting Lore](../skills.md#Lore) or [Sailing Lore](../skills.md#Lore) check, you can use your [Driving Lore](../skills.md#Lore) proficiency instead.

You can use Dexterity in place of Intelligence when attempting piloting checks with [Driving Lore](../skills.md#Lore). You become an expert in [Driving Lore](../skills.md#Lore). At 7th level, you become a master in [Driving Lore](../skills.md#Lore), and at 15th level, you become legendary in [Driving Lore](../skills.md#Lore).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the trick driver archetype.

## Trick Driver Dedication leads to...

[Drive-by Attack](drive-by-attack-g-g.md), [Express Driver](express-driver-g-g.md), [Power Slide](power-slide-g-g.md), [Push It](push-it-g-g.md), [Roadkill](roadkill-g-g.md), [Take The Wheel](take-the-wheel-g-g.md)
