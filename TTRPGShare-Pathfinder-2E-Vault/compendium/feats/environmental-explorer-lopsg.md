[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)

Your extensive familiarity means you sometimes notice perils even when you're not trying to. Even if you aren't [Searching](../../rules/actions/search.md) in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find environmental hazards that normally require you to [Search](../../rules/actions/search.md) for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular hazard.
