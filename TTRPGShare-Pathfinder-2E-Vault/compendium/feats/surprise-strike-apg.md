[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Weapon Improviser Dedication](weapon-improviser-dedication-apg.md)

Whenever you make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with an improvised weapon against a creature that hasn't seen you make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) using an improvised weapon or that is otherwise ignorant of your skill with improvised weapons, the creature is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against you for that [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
