# Tomb-watcher's Glare  *Feat 5*  
[divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: death warden dwarf heritage

When you critically hit an undead creature, or an undead creature critically fails a saving throw against one of your abilities, you drive your divine wrath home in your enemy's heart. The undead is [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.
