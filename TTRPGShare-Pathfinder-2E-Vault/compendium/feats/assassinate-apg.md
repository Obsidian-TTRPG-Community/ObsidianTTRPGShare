# Assassinate  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Assassin Dedication](assassin-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You have designated a mark using Mark for Death and are completely [unnoticed](../../rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) by your mark.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You strike with one swift movement, trying to instantly slay your mark. Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against your mark. If you hit, your mark takes `6d6` extra precision damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

If the mark critically fails, they die. This is an [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Assassinate for 1 day.
