# Fiendish Lore  *Feat 1*  
[tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


You were raised by a tiefling or a fiendish relative, or you've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the fiendish realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) and [Religion](../skills.md#Religion). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also become trained in a [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill related to the fiendish plane from which you trace your lineage (usually [Abaddon Lore](../skills.md#Lore), [Abyss Lore](../skills.md#Lore), or [Hell Lore](../skills.md#Lore)).
