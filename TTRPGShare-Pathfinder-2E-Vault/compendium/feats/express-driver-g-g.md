# Express Driver  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [exploration](../../rules/traits/exploration.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Trick Driver Dedication](trick-driver-dedication-g-g.md)

You can optimize your vehicle's performance, coaxing extra speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns.

When calculating your travel speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a [Driving Lore](../skills.md#Lore) check to increase your vehicle's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.
