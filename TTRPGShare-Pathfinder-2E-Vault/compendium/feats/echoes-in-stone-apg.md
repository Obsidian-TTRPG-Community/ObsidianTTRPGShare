# Echoes In Stone  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 9*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are standing on a stone or earthen surface.
- **Activity** Single Action

You pause a moment to attune your senses to the stone around you. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a new sense: imprecise [tremorsense](../../rules/abilities/tremorsense.md) with a range of 20 feet.
