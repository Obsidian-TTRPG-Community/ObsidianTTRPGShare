# Fey Fellowship  *Feat 1*  
[gnome](../../rules/traits/gnome.md)  


Your enhanced fey connection affords you a warmer reception from creatures of the First World as well as tools to foil their tricks. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks and saving throws against [fey](../../rules/traits/fey.md).

In addition, whenever you meet a fey creature in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.

**Special.** If you have the [Glad-Hand](glad-hand.md) skill feat, you don't take the penalty on your immediate [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check if the target is a fey.
