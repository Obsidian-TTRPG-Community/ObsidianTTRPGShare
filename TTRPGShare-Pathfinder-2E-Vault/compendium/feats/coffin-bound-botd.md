# Coffin Bound  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vampire Dedication](vampire-dedication-botd.md)

You bind your spirit to a coffin filled with soil of your homeland, making it a place of recovery. If you rest inside your coffin for 10 minutes, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. You can still be healed in other ways during that time, though you're [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and therefore unable to heal yourself. The GM might allow you to [Refocus](../../rules/actions/refocus.md) while resting, depending on whether it's a type of Refocusing you can achieve while you slumber.

If you would be destroyed, you instead remain near death. This doesn't change your [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) or [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) value, and you remain [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). After 1 hour, you're destroyed. If returned to your coffin before that hour is up, you avoid destruction; if you spend 1 hour resting in your coffin, you regain 1 HP and lose the [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) and [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) conditions. You can't be healed in any other way when near death.

Your coffin can't heal you if you're staked through the chest. You can be staked only if [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), and it takes three actions. You lose all benefits of this feat if your coffin is destroyed or the soil is lost. You must procure a new coffin and fill it with soil of your homeland to restore the feat's function.
