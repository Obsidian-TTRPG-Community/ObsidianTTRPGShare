# Sacral Lord  *Feat 4*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [oracle](../../rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) or [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)

By right of ritual or sheer stubbornness, you have claimed rulership of the land. Claim a defined territory, such as a small section of forest or river, or a district of a larger city. Within its borders, you can cast [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md), guidance, and sigil as innate divine cantrips, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on creatures that have the celestial, fiend, fey, [monitor](../../rules/traits/monitor.md), or [spirit](../../rules/traits/spirit.md) traits.

**Special.** You and your land are linked. Changes to one mirror themselves on the other—if you're depressed, gray rain and clammy mist might set in. These effects have no immediate mechanical impact, but they might give clues about problems afflicting the land.
