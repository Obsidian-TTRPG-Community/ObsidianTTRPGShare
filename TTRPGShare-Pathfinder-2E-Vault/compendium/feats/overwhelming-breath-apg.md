# Overwhelming Breath  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: ki spells
- **Activity** Single Action

You control your breathing and align it with your ki, exhaling with controlled force in order to overcome your opponent's resistance. If you use your next action to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that has the [monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md) trait and no duration, the spell and any [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) you make as a result of casting it ignore an amount of the target's resistance to physical damage equal to your level.
