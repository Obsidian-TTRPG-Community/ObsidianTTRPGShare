# Fascinating Performance  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance)

When you [Perform](../../rules/actions/perform.md), compare your result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by you for 1 round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the [Perform](../../rules/actions/perform.md) action gains the [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md) trait. You must choose which creature you're trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour. If you're an expert in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance), you can fascinate up to four observers; if you're a master, you can fascinate up to 10 observers; and if you're legendary, you can fascinate any number of observers at the same time.
