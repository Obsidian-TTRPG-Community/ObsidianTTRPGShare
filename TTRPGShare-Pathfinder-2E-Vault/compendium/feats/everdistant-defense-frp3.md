# Everdistant Defense  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature within your aura is targeted by a ranged attack or a creature moves through your aura.
- **Requirements**: You have at least one aura from a champion feat or feature.
- **Activity** Reaction

The spatial barrier of Syndara's Island has taught you that distance can foil enemies better than any armor. You warp space, causing each square within your aura that the attack or creature would move through to count as triple the distance.

If this reaction is used on a ranged attack, the attack takes range increment penalties based on the adjusted range and fails if this would cause it to exceed its maximum range.
