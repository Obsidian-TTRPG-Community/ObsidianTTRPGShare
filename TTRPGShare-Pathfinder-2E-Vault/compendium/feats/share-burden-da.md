# Share Burden  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Curse Maelstrom Dedication](curse-maelstrom-dedication-da.md)
- **Trigger** An ally within 60 feet would be affected by a [curse](../../rules/traits/curse.md) or [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect, and you wouldn't be affected but you are an eligible target for the effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

You draw the misfortune or curse into yourself, potentially enabling you to enter your curse maelstrom state. Instead of affecting your ally, the triggering [curse](../../rules/traits/curse.md) or [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect affects you.
