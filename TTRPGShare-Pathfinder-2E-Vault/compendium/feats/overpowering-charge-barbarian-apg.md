# Overpowering Charge (Barbarian)  *Feat 10*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Barreling Charge

You trample your foes as you charge past them. When you use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a creature's space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier. If you critically succeed, the creature takes twice this amount of damage and becomes [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of your next turn.
