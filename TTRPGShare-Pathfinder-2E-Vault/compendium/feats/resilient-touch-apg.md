# Resilient Touch  *Feat 10*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: devotion spell ([lay on hands](../spells/lay-on-hands.md))

Your healing energies create an aura of protection that defends your allies against more than just blades and arrows.

An ally that recovers Hit Points from your lay on hands gains a +1 status bonus to their saving throws until the end of their next turn.
