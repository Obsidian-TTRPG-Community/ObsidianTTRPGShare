# Beastbrood  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


One of your ancestors was a [rakshasa](../../rules/traits/rakshasa-b1.md), the corrupt and aristocratic reincarnated souls that call Golarion home. You have some dim echo of your ancestor's memories— enough to play the role of noble as needed, no matter your origins. You're trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society). If you're already trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [Courtly Graces](courtly-graces.md) skill feat.

## Beastbrood leads to...

[Reveal Hidden Self](reveal-hidden-self-loil.md), [Jalmeri Rakshasa Magic](jalmeri-rakshasa-magic-loil.md), [Idol Threat](idol-threat-loil.md), [Rakshasa Magic](rakshasa-magic-loag.md)
