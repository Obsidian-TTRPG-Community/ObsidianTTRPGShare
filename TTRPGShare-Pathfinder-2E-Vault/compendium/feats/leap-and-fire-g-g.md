# Leap And Fire  *Feat 8*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hit the Dirt!](hit-the-dirt-g-g.md)

You're quick enough to line up a shot even while diving to the ground. When you use your Hit the Dirt! reaction, at any point during your [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) you can also make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a loaded firearm or crossbow, targeting the creature whose attack triggered the reaction.
