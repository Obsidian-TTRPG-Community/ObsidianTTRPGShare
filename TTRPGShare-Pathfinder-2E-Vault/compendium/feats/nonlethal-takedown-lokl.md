# Nonlethal Takedown  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md)

You prefer to use nonlethal means against living opponents, but the weapons you carry are lethal enough to destroy undead. You don't take the normal –2 circumstance penalty when attacking nonlethally with a weapon that lacks the [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait.
