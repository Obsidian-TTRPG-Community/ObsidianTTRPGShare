# Warding Rune  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Runescarred Dedication](runescarred-dedication-lowg.md)

Your runes provide a warding effect that protects you against a specific school of magic. Choose a school of magic other than divination. You gain a rune on your body corresponding to that school, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against effects of that school.
