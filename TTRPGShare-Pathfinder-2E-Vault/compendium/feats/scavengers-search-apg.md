# Scavenger's Search  *Feat 1*  
[tengu](../../rules/traits/tengu-b1.md)  


You're always on the lookout for supplies and valuables. Each time you use the [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) action to search for objects (including secret doors and hazards), you can search for objects in your choice of a 10-foot emanation around you or an adjacent 15-foot-by-15-foot area, rather than a single adjacent 10-foot-by-10-foot area.
