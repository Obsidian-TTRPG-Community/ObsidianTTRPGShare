# Reptile Speaker  *Feat 1*  
[lizardfolk](../../rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  


You hear the sounds of reptiles as language. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) skill with animals that are reptiles (the GM determines which animals count as reptiles).
