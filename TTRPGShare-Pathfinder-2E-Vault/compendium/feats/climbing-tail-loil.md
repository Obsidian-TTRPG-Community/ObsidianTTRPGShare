# Climbing Tail  *Feat 1*  
[vanara](../../rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  


Your tail makes it much easier for you to climb. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md), you gain the [Combat Climber](combat-climber.md) skill feat, and you reduce the number of free hands required to [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md) or [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) by one.
