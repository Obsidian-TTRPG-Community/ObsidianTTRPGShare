# Ardent Armiger  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Armiger Dedication](hellknight-armiger-dedication-lowg.md)

You have been trained to resist the manipulations of fiends, and your Hellknight discipline makes you difficult to influence. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects that specifically improve your attitude and to your Will DC against someone Coercing you, Demoralizing you, [Making an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on you, or Making a [Request](../../rules/actions/request.md) of you.

If a [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect would compel you to act in a way that violates your Hellknight order's tenets (as determined by the GM), you can attempt to break free from the effect as a reaction triggered by receiving the violating order, and you gain a new Will save against the effect. You can attempt this new save only once for a given effect, even if you are compelled to violate your order's tenets multiple times.
