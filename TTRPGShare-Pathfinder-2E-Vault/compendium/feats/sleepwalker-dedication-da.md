# Sleepwalker Dedication  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism)

You've learned to manipulate states of consciousness, beginning with your own. You can send yourself into a half-awake, daydreaming state and gain the Daydream Trance action. Daydream Trance [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") (enchantment, mental, occult) You fall into a half-sleeping trance. This lasts for 1 minute or until you fall [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), whichever comes first. You can voluntarily end your trance by taking a single action, which has a [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, and succeeding at a Will save against your own class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

Once your trance ends, you can't enter a Daydream Trance again for 1 minute. While you're in your trance, you gain the following effects:

- You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves. This bonus increases to +2 against [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects. If you're legendary in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism), the bonus against [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects increases to +3.
- You take a –1 penalty to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks and initiative rolls.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sleepwalker archetype.
