# Dual-weapon Reload  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding two one-handed weapons, each in a different hand, one of which is a ranged weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to reload while holding two weapons. You [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to reload a one-handed ranged weapon you're holding. Unlike most [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) actions, you don't need a free hand to reload your ranged weapon in this way.
