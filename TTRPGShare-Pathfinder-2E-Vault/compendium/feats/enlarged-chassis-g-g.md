# Enlarged Chassis  *Feat 13*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Medium or Small size

You've empowered your core to support a larger body, granting you size and additional reach. You gain the effects of [enlarge](../spells/enlarge.md) constantly.

**Enhancement** Your core's empowerment has stabilized, allowing for greater support. You are no longer [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) due to the effects of [enlarge](../spells/enlarge.md).
