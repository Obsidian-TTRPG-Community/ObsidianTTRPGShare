# Elemental Lore  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](../../rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md)  [oread](../../rules/traits/oread-b2.md)  [suli](../../rules/traits/suli-b2.md)  [sylph](../../rules/traits/sylph-b2.md)  [undine](../../rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  


You've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the Inner Sphere. You gain the trained proficiency in your choice of [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) and either [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](../skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in the [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) associated with your Elemental Plane of origin (such as Plane of [Fire Lore](../skills.md#Lore)).
