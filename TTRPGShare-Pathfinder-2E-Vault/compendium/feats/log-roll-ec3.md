[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Turpin Rowe Lumberjack Dedication](turpin-rowe-lumberjack-dedication-ec3.md)
- **Requirements**: You and an adjacent creature are both on a narrow surface or uneven ground and the other creature is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed).
- **Activity** Single Action

You shuffle your feet to dislodge the surface beneath you or otherwise cause your opponent to become unsteady.

Attempt an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check against the adjacent creature's Reflex saving throw DC. On a success, the creature falls. On a critical failure, you fall.
