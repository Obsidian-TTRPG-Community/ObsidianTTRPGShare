# Grave Sense  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md)

Your time spent hunting the undead allows you to sense them.

You sense undead as a vague sense (Core Rulebook 465) similar to a human's sense of smell, an uncomfortable sensation akin to smelling something cloying and rotting. When in proximity to the undead, you eventually sense their presence, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint their location. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check against your [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds at its [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check, it is then temporarily immune to your Grave Sense for 1 day.
