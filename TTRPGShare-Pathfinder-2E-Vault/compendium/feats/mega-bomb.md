# Mega Bomb  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 20*  
[additive <3>](../../rules/traits/additive.md)  [alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Expanded Splash](expanded-splash.md)
- **Requirements**: You are holding an infused alchemical bomb you crafted, with a level at least 3 lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Single Action

You add an incredibly powerful additive to a held bomb to create a mega bomb, greatly increasing its area and power.You use an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to throw the mega bomb, rather than [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), and you don't make an attack roll. The mega bomb affects creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst, centered within 60 feet of you. The bomb deals damage as if each creature were the primary target, with a basic Reflex save. On a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that affect a primary target (such as [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) from bottled lightning). While all targets in the area take splash damage as primary targets, there is no further splash beyond that area. If your next action after creating a mega bomb isn't an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to throw it, the mega bomb denatures and loses all effects.
