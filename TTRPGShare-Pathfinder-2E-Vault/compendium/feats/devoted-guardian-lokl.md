[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Requirements**: Your last action was to [Raise a Shield](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You adopt a wide stance, ready to defend both yourself and your chosen ward. Select one adjacent creature. As long as your shield is raised and the creature remains adjacent to you, the creature gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their AC, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the shield you raised was a tower shield.
