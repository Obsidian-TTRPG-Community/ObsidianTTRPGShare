# Unified Theory  *Feat 15*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana)

You've started to make a meaningful connection about the common underpinnings of the four traditions of magic and magical essences, allowing you to understand them all through an arcane lens. Whenever you use a skill action or a skill feat that requires a [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) check, depending on the magic tradition, you can use [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) instead. If you would normally take a penalty or have a higher DC for using [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) on other magic (such as when using [Identify Magic](../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md)), you no longer do so.
