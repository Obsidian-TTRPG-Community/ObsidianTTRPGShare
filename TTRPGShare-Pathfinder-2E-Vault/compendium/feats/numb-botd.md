# Numb  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Zombie Dedication](zombie-dedication-botd.md)

As your body continues to rot and putrefy, your senses deaden and your undead powers grow. You gain the advanced undead benefits (page 44), as well as a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) and pain effects. While your body is deteriorated, your numbness amplifies in two ways: the circumstance bonus from this feat increases to +2, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against an [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) or pain effect, you get a critical success instead.
