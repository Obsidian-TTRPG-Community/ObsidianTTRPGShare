# Targeting Shot  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [press](../../rules/traits/press.md)  [ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hunter's Aim](hunters-aim.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You carefully track your prey's position and defenses, allowing you to follow up around obstacles that block your shot. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against your hunted prey. You ignore the target's [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition and all cover.
