# Metamagic Channel  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 20*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Activity** Free Action

Deep understanding of divine revelations into the nature of vital essence allows you to freely manipulate the effects of your positive or negative energy. Use 1 [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md) action that you can perform that normally takes 1 action and can be applied to the [harm](../spells/harm.md) or [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell. If you use it in this way, its effects apply only to a [harm](../spells/harm.md) or [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell.
