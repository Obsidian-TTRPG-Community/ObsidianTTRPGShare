# Additional Companion  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Beastmaster Dedication](beastmaster-dedication-apg.md)

Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal companion that has the [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md) trait. See Beastmaster Animal Companions for rules on how having multiple animal companions works.

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once, gaining an additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of four total companions (including the one you gained from Beastmaster Dedication and possibly one you gained from sources other than the beastmaster archetype).
