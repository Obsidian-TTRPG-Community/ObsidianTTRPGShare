# Folklorist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance)

You are a master archivist and entertainer, capable of pulling wisdom from the tales you tell and weaving your allies and enemies into a powerful narrative. You gain the Spin Tale action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Spin Tale [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [linguistic](../../../rules/traits/linguistic.md)  

You tell a story, designating one of your allies (but not yourself) as the hero of the story, and one enemy as the villain; both must be within 60 feet. The hero gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws against the villain until the start of your next turn. If you Spin a Tale on your next turn, the story continues for another round, for a maximum of 10 rounds. While the tale continues, minor, crude illusions spring into being in your space; these are [arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md) [illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md) effects that have no mechanical impact other than illustrating your tale.  
%% #trait/auditory #trait/linguistic %%
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the folklorist archetype.

## Folklorist Dedication leads to...

[Communal Tale](communal-tale-sot2.md), [Folktales Lore](folktales-lore-sot2.md), [Narrative Conduit](narrative-conduit-sot2.md), [Rule Of Three](rule-of-three-sot2.md)
