# Clockwork Reanimator Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You can animate corpses through cunning engineering. You gain a prototype construct companion to serve as a [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md). Unlike normal construct companions, yours is a corpse animated by clockwork gears and technological prowess.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the clockwork reanimator archetype. If you retrain out of this feat, you lose the rituals learned from it.

## Clockwork Reanimator Dedication leads to...

[Advanced Reanimated Companion](advanced-reanimated-companion-ooa3.md), [Incredible Reanimated Companion](incredible-reanimated-companion-ooa3.md), [Paragon Reanimated Companion](paragon-reanimated-companion-ooa3.md), [Hijack Undead](hijack-undead-ooa3.md), [Improved Hijack Undead](improved-hijack-undead-ooa3.md), [It's Alive!](its-alive-ooa3.md), [Self-Destruct](self-destruct-ooa3.md), [Unwind Death](unwind-death-ooa3.md), [Zombie Horde](zombie-horde-ooa3.md)
