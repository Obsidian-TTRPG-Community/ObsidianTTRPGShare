# Mirror Shield  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Trigger** An opponent casting a spell that targets you critically fails a spell attack roll against your AC.
- **Requirements**: You have a [shield raised](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You reflect the spell back against the triggering opponent. Make a ranged attack against the triggering creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. If you can cast spells, you can make a spell attack roll instead. If you succeed, your opponent takes the effects of a successful spell attack roll for their own spell (or the effects of a critical success if your attack roll was a critical success).
