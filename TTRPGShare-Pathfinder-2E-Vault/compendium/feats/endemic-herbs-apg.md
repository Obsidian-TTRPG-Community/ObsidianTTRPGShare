# Endemic Herbs  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Herbalist Dedication](herbalist-dedication-apg.md), trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)

During your daily preparations, you find medicinal plants endemic to your location. Until your next preparations, you can spend an additional batch of herbs to add a benefit to an item you create with your herbalism. The benefit of the special herbs affects the creature that the item is applied to; if the benefit is not immediate, it lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated. This adjustment counts as an additive (Core Rulebook 75), so you can't include another additive without spoiling the item.

- **Aquatic** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves.
- **Arctic** For 1 hour, treat environmental [cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md) effects as if they were one step less severe.
- **Desert** For 1 hour, treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less severe.
- **Forest** Gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against [disease](../../rules/traits/disease.md) and [poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md) effects.
- **Mountain** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves.
- **Plains** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves.
- **Swamp** Remove one source of [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
- **Underground** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception).
