# Trickster Tengu  *Feat 17*  
[tengu](../../rules/traits/tengu-b1.md)  


You can transform yourself or the bodies of others to express your displeasure.

Once per day, you can cast either [aerial form](../spells/aerial-form.md) or [baleful polymorph](../spells/baleful-polymorph.md) as a 7th-level primal innate spell. You must take the form of a bird when using this [aerial form](../spells/aerial-form.md).
