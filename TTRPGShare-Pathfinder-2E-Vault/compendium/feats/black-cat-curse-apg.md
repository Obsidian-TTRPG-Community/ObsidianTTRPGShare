# Black Cat Curse  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[catfolk](../../rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md)  [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet you can see would succeed at a save.
- **Activity** Reaction

You hiss a spiteful curse at the creature. The target must reroll the triggering saving throw and use the worse result.
