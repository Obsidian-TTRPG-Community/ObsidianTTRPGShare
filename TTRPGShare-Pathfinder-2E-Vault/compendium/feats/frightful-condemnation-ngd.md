# Frightful Condemnation  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [vigilante](../../rules/traits/vigilante-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Harsh Judgment](harsh-judgment-ngd.md), [Vigilante Dedication](vigilante-dedication-apg.md), member of the Gray Gardeners
- **Trigger** You hit your condemned foe with a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) in the same turn during which you condemned it with Harsh Judgment.
- **Requirements**: You have condemned a foe to death with [Harsh Judgment](harsh-judgment-ngd.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

Your willingness to follow through on your pitiless judgment is frightful to the person you have condemned, and they begin to dread what you will do to them next.

Your condemned foe is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) if the triggering [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit.
