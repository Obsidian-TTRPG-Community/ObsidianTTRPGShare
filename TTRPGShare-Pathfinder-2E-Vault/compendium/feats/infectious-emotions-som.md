# Infectious Emotions  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cathartic Mage Dedication](cathartic-mage-dedication-som.md)

When you use Catharsis, one ally within 30 feet gains the catharsis activation benefits in addition to you. If these benefits require an emotional focus, they use your emotional focus as they're experiencing an empathic imprint of your emotions. Depending on the activation benefit, it might be impossible to grant it to an ally; for instance, pride could only have an effect for an ally if both you and the ally critically failed the same saving throw against the same effect.
