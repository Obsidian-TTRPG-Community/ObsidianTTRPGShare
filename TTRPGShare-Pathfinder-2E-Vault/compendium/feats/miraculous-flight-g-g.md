# Miraculous Flight  *Feat 18*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vehicle Mechanic Dedication](vehicle-mechanic-dedication-g-g.md)

With superior engineering and magical application, you have freed your signature vehicle from the bonds of gravity, allowing it to soar through the sky like a dragon. The vehicle gains magical propulsion and a fly Speed equal to its fastest current Speed. If your signature vehicle already had a fly Speed, reduce the distance the vehicle needs to make a 90-degree turn to half the usual length (typically half the length of the vehicle).
