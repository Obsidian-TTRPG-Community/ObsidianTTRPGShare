# Hobgoblin Lore  *Feat 1*  
[hobgoblin](../../rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md)  


You've studied traditional hobgoblin exercises and fieldcraft, all of which have a militaristic bent. You become trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) and [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting). For each of these skills in which you were already trained, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Hobgoblin Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
