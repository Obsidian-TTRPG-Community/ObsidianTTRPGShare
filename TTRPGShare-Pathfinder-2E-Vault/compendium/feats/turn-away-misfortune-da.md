# Turn Away Misfortune  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [esoterica](../../rules/traits/esoterica-da.md)  [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [thaumaturge](../../rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Trigger** You would attempt a roll affected by a [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

You perform a superstition, such as casting salt over your shoulder to ward off bad luck. Turn Away Misfortune's [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md) trait cancels out the [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect, causing you to roll normally. As normal, you can apply only one fortune ability to a roll, so if you Turned Away Misfortune on an attack roll, you couldn't also use an ability like [Halfling Luck](halfling-luck.md) to alter the roll further.
