# All In My Head  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 18*  
[bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Trigger** You would take damage from a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) or spell that doesn't have the [death](../../rules/traits/death.md) trait or otherwise cause instant death (such as [disintegrate](../spells/disintegrate.md)).
- **Activity** Reaction

Using your occult connections and incredible powers of persuasion, you convince yourself that the triggering damage is a figment of your imagination. The damage changes from its usual damage type to mental damage, and the damaging effect gains the [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait. You can't use this reaction if you are immune to [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects or mental damage.
