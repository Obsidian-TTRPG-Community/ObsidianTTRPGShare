# Tide-hardened  *Feat 1*  
[undine](../../rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  


You're at home in the unpredictable tides. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md) and [water](../../rules/traits/water.md) effects. If you roll a success on a save against a [cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md) or [water](../../rules/traits/water.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.
