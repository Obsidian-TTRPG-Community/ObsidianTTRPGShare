# Improvise Tool  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You can jury-rig solutions when you don't have the proper tools on hand. You can attempt to [Repair](../../rules/actions/repair.md) damaged items without a repair kit.

If you have the raw materials available, you can [Craft](../../rules/actions/craft.md) a basic caltrop set, candle, compass, crowbar, fishing tackle, flint and steel, hammer, ladder, piton, rope, 10-foot pole, replacement thieves' picks, long or short tool, or torch without consulting a basic crafter's book.
