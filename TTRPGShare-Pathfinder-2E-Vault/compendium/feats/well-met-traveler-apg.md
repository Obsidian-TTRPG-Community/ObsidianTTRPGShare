# Well-met Traveler  *Feat 1*  
[catfolk](../../rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md)  


You have seen people from so many walks of life in your travels that you naturally adopt a pleasant and affable demeanor when meeting others. You are trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy). If you would automatically become trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

In addition, you gain the [Hobnobber](hobnobber.md) skill feat.
