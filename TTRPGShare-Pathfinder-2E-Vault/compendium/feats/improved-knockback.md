# Improved Knockback  *Feat 12*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

When you successfully [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) a creature, increase both the distance you can push the creature and the distance you can move to follow along with the target by 5 feet on a success or 10 feet on a critical success. If you push the target into an obstacle, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to 6 plus your Strength modifier, or 8 plus your Strength modifier if you have legendary proficiency in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics).
