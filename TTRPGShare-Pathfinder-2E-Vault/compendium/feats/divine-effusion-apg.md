# Divine Effusion  *Feat 18*  
[oracle](../../rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  


The power of your mystery surges through you like a font of divine energy, even when your own magic dwindles. Twice per day, you can cast a spell after you've run out of spell slots of the appropriate spell level; the two spells you cast with this feat must be of different spell levels.
