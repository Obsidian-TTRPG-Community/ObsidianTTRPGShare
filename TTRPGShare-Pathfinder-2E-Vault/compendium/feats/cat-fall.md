# Cat Fall  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics)

Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your falls. Treat falls as 10 feet shorter. If you're an expert in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), treat falls as 25 feet shorter. If you're a master in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you're legendary in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), you always land on your feet and don't take damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.
