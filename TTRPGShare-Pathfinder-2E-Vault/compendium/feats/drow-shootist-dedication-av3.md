# Drow Shootist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in the [hand crossbow](../equipment/items/hand-crossbow.md)

Every chance you get, you practice with the hand crossbow to increase your draw speed and accuracy. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You also gain the Shootist's Draw action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Shootist's Draw [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a hand crossbow and [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with it, or you [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a loaded hand crossbow you're already holding and then [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to stow it.
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the drow shootist archetype.
