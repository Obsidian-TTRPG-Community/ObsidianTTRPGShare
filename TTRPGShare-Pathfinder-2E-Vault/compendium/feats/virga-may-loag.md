[changeling](../../rules/traits/changeling-b1.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


Born of a storm hag, you have one crystal-blue or rain-gray eye. You share your mother's power over wind and storm. You can cast [electric arc](../spells/electric-arc.md) as an occult innate cantrip. As normal, a cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.

## Virga May leads to...

[Favorable Winds](favorable-winds-loag.md), [Invoke The Elements](invoke-the-elements-loag.md), [Stormy Heart](stormy-heart-loag.md)
