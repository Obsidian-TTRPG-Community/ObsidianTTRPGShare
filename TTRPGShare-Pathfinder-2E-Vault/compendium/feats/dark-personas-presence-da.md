# Dark Persona's Presence  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 8*  
[aura](../../rules/traits/aura.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Trigger** You [Unleash your Psyche](../../rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

When you [Unleash your Psyche](../../rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md), all your rage and pain—the portion of your psyche dedicated to cruel retribution—come along with it.

The force of your dark persona's negativity batters constantly against all creatures in a 30-foot emanation when you [Unleash your Psyche](../../rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md) and for as long as your [Psyche is Unleashed](../../rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md). A creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC the first time it enters the emanation, or if it's in the emanation when you take this action; it doesn't need to attempt a save again, even if it leaves the emanation and returns. A creature [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) by your Dark Persona's Presence can't decrease its [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value below 1 while within the emanation.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
>
>    While your [Psyche is Unleashed](../../rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md), your dark persona cares only for destruction. You can [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) only if it can directly damage an enemy or object or can impose a detrimental condition or penalty on one.
