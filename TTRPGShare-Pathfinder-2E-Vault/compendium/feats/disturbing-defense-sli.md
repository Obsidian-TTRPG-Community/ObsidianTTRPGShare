# Disturbing Defense  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oozemorph Dedication](oozemorph-dedication-sli.md)

Your internal organs and blood vessels have shifted and changed, and even you don't know precisely where in your body they are. You gain resistance to precision damage equal to 2 + your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype. The DC of your flat checks to recover from [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is 13, rather than 15.

## Disturbing Defense leads to...

[Peculiar Anatomy](peculiar-anatomy-sli.md), [Rubbery Skin](rubbery-skin-sli.md)
