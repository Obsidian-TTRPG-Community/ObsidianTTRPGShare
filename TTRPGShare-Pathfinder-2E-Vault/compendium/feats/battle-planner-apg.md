# Battle Planner  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Warfare Lore](../skills.md#Lore)

You are constantly drawing up plans and battle scenarios, assembling strategies and gathered intelligence for later use.

When you scout an enemy's position or receive a detailed report from an ally who scouted the enemy's position, if you have a clear indication of the number, position, and identities of your potential foes, you can spend 1 minute to come up with a battle plan that takes such potential factors into account and reduces the role luck plays in the equation. Roll a [Warfare Lore](../skills.md#Lore) check. As long as the information was accurate and remains accurate when you roll initiative against those enemies, you can use the [Warfare Lore](../skills.md#Lore) result you previously rolled for your initiative roll; if you do, this is a [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect.
