# Mask Of Rejection  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [orc](../../rules/traits/orc.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Orc Warmask](orc-warmask-loag.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You fail a saving throw against an effect from your warmask's magical tradition.
- **Requirements**: You're wearing your warmask.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your warmask projects a white-hot fury that attempts to vaporize the offending magic. You reroll the triggering check with a +2 circumstance bonus, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse than your first roll.
