# Legendary Codebreaker  *Feat 15*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Society](../skills.md#Society)

Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you can decipher information with little more than a quick read through a text. You can [Decipher Writing](../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md) using [Society](../skills.md#Society) while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend the full amount of time that's ordinarily required and roll a success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document.
