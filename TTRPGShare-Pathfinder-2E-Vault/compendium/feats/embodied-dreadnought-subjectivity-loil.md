# Embodied Dreadnought Subjectivity  *Feat 5*  
[fleshwarp](../../rules/traits/fleshwarp-loag.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You're from Nex.
- **Prerequisites**: cataphract fleshwarp heritage

Your colossal might marks you as a behemoth, the pride of Nex's Fleshforges, and the heaviest ordnance is a child's toy in your monumental grasp. You're a dreadnought, a living siege weapon, albeit one that wields other siege weapons in battle as your endoskeleton and flesh toughens. You gain the [Hefty Hauler](hefty-hauler.md) skill feat, and your maximum Bulk limit further increases by 3, for a total of 2 to your [encumbered](../../rules/conditions.md#Encumbered) limit and 5 to your maximum limit.
