# Unravel Mysteries  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in a [Decipher Writing](../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md) skill, [Scrollmaster Dedication](scrollmaster-dedication-locg.md)

You can understand the true meaning of texts quickly, and even when you get lost or hit a dead end, you aren't discouraged from making further attempts to get to the bottom of things. When you [Decipher Writing](../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md), you need only half as long as usual (reducing the time from about 1 minute to about half a minute per page), and if you fail, you don't take the usual –2 circumstance penalty to further checks to decipher that text.
