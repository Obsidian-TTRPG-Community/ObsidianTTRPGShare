# Scatter Blast  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm that has the scatter trait.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You pack your weapon with additional shot and powder, creating a risky but devastating wave of destruction. Make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the firearm. The firearm's range increment increases by 20 feet and the radius of its scatter increases by 20 feet. The [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) gains the following failure conditions.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** The firearm misfires, but it doesn't cause the other critical failure effects listed below.
> - **Critical Failure** The firearm misfires and also explodes. It becomes [broken](../../rules/conditions.md#Broken), and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the firearm, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. This damage includes any from the weapon's fundamental and property runes.
