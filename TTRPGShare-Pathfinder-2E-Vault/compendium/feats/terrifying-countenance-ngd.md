- **Prerequisites**: [Vigilante Dedication](vigilante-dedication-apg.md), member of the Gray Gardeners
- **Activity** Free Action

You can erect a magical cowl that terrorizes your enemies. Once per day, you can cast [mask of terror](../spells/mask-of-terror.md) as an innate occult spell, targeting yourself. If you critically hit a creature that's temporarily immune to the spell, the creature's temporary immunity ends.
