# Hijack Undead  [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clockwork Reanimator Dedication](clockwork-reanimator-dedication-ooa3.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your clockwork devices can commandeer the bodies of undead, bending them to your will. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against an adjacent undead creature. On a success, instead of taking damage, the target becomes [controlled](../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you if its level is equal to or lower than your level – 3. It can attempt a Will saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC to resist being [controlled](../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you. If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and temporarily immune for 24 hours.
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The undead creature becomes a [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md) under your control for 1 minute. The control ends if you or an ally attacks the [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md) undead.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.
