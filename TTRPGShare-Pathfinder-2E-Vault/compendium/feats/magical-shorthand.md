# Magical Shorthand  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)

Learning spells comes easily to you. If you're an expert in a tradition's associated skill, you take 10 minutes per spell level to learn a spell of that tradition, rather than 1 hour per spell level. If you fail to learn the spell, you can try again after 1 week or after you gain a level, whichever comes first. If you're a master in the tradition's associated skill, learning a spell takes 5 minutes per spell level, and if you're legendary, it takes 1 minute per spell level. You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works as if you were using [Earn Income](../../rules/actions/earn-income.md) with the tradition's associated skill, but instead of gaining money, you choose a spell available to you to learn and gain a discount on learning it, learning it for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost.
