# Gigavolt  *Feat 12*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Megavolt](megavolt-g-g.md)

When you unleash electricity from your innovation, you can bounce it off obstacles, creating a field of electric death. When you use [Megavolt](megavolt-g-g.md), each time your line of electricity hits a solid barrier, such as a wall, it bounces off at an angle of your choice and continues until you have reached the full length of the line. Even if a creature is in the area from multiple bounces, it takes the damage only once.
