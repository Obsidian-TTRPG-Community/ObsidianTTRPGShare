# Multitalented  *Feat 9*  
[human](../../rules/traits/human.md)  


You've learned to split your focus between multiple classes with ease. You gain a 2nd-level multiclass dedication feat, even if you normally couldn't take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype.

If you're a half-elf, you don't need to meet the feat's ability score prerequisites.
