# Animal Trainer Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Trained in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)

You gain the services of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys simple commands as best as it can. This trained animal is trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) instead of the skill listed for its type.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the animal trainer archetype.

## Animal Trainer Dedication leads to...

[Beast Speaker](beast-speaker-ec2.md), [Mature Trained Companion](mature-trained-companion-ec2.md), [Splendid Companion](splendid-companion-ec2.md), [Specialized Companion](specialized-companion-ec2.md)
