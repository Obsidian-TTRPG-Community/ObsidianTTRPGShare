# Snap Out Of It!  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine), [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

Pathfinders are trained to help each other be safe and successful, and you know how to jolt your allies back to their senses. Attempt a [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) check on an adjacent ally who is [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned), or [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) and choose one of those conditions. The DC is the DC for the effect that caused the condition.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 2. If you chose [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), that condition ends.
> - **Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), that condition ends.
> - **Failure** The target is unaffected.
> - **Critical Failure** You increase the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), increase the duration by 1 round instead.
