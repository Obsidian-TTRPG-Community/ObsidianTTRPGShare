# Graceful Poise  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Double Slice](double-slice.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

With the right positioning, your off-hand weapon can strike like a scorpion's stinger. While you are in this stance, if you make your second [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) from Double Slice with an [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) weapon, Double Slice counts as one attack when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
