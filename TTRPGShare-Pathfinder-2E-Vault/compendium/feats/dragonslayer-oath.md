[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [oath](../../rules/traits/oath.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

You've sworn to slay evil dragons. Add the following tenet to your code after the others: "You must slay evil dragons you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success."

Your [Retributive Strike](../../rules/actions/retributive-strike.md) gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against an evil dragon, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used. Your [Glimpse of Redemption](../../rules/actions/glimpse-of-redemption.md)'s resistance against damage from an evil dragon is 7 + your level. If you use [Liberating Step](../../rules/actions/liberating-step.md) triggered by an evil dragon, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your [Liberating Step](../../rules/actions/liberating-step.md), and the ally can [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) twice afterward.

You don't consider evil dragons to be legitimate authorities, even in nations they rule.
