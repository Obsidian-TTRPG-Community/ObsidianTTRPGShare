[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Camouflage](camouflage.md), [Animal Companion](animal-companion-ranger.md)

You've trained your animal companion to blend in to its surroundings. Your animal companion gains the benefit of the Camouflage feat. If your companion is a specialized ambusher, its proficiency rank for [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) increases to master (or legendary if it was already master).
