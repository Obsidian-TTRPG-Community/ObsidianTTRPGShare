# Ricochet Stance (Fighter)  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You adopt a stance designed to rebound your thrown weapons back toward you. While you are in this stance, any thrown weapons you use as part of a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) to deal bludgeoning or slashing damage immediately return to your hand, enabling you to use them for additional [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md). You must be within the weapon's listed range increment and have a hand free to catch the weapon. If you make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a thrown weapon outside of its listed range increment, it instead flies back toward you a number of feet equal to its listed range increment and then falls to the ground.
