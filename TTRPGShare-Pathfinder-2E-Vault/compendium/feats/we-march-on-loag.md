# We March On  *Feat 13*  
[hobgoblin](../../rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md)  


You make sure that your allies push themselves while traveling.

You gain the [Caravan Leader](caravan-leader-apg.md) and [Pick Up the Pace](pick-up-the-pace-apg.md) general feats, even if you don't meet the prerequisites.
