# Crowd Mastery  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lost in the Crowd](lost-in-the-crowd-lowg.md)

You use the crowd to your advantage, diverting your foes' attention to potential [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) dangers in the crowd. When determining if your foe is flanked, treat all squares occupied by a crowd as if they were occupied by an ally with a melee reach of 5 feet.
