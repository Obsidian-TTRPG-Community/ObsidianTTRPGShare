# Mask Familiar  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md)

Your mask takes on a personality of its own, allowing it to serve as your familiar. Though you can still wear it as a mask, you can detach it from your face to grant it a bodily form of colored light that allows it to move around; usually, this is a miniature form of the animal the mask represents. Detaching or reattaching the familiar to transform it is a two-action activity. Even in mask form, the familiar can move around on its master's face and speaks in a distinct voice (if it can talk). It is easily recognized as more than a simple mask unless the familiar succeeds at a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check to [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) a mask. Other than its appearance and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars. Your mask familiar has access to the mask freeze familiar ability.
