# Reflexive Shield  *Feat 6*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  


You can use your shield to fend off the worst of area effects and other damage. When you [Raise your Shield](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), you gain your shield's circumstance bonus to Reflex saves. If you have the [Shield Block](shield-block.md) reaction, damage you take as a result of a Reflex save can trigger that reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.
