# Elemental Fist  *Feat 2*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ki Strike](ki-strike.md)

You call upon the power of the elements, infusing your ki with elemental energy and allowing your attacks to deal energy damage. When you cast [ki strike](../spells/ki-strike.md), in addition to the damage types normally available, you can deliver the extra damage in the form of a gust of storm-tossed wind (dealing electricity damage and gaining the [air](../../rules/traits/air.md) trait), a chunk of stone (dealing bludgeoning damage and gaining the [earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md) trait), a flickering flame (dealing fire damage), or a crashing wave of frigid water (dealing cold damage and gaining the [water](../../rules/traits/water.md) trait).
