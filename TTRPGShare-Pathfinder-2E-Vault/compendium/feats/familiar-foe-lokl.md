# Familiar Foe  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md), expert in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) or [Undead Lore](../skills.md#Lore)

You regularly face off against undead and can identify many with a glance. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on skill checks to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about undead. Whenever you roll a critical failure on a check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about undead, you get a failure instead.
