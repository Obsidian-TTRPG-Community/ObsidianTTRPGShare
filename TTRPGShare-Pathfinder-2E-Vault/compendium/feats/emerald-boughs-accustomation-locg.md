# Emerald Boughs Accustomation  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Emerald Boughs affiliation, expert in [Society](../skills.md#Society)

You are comfortable and socially capable in almost any cultural context. When you use the [Society](../skills.md#Society) skill to [Subsist](../../rules/actions/subsist.md), if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead; if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead; and if you roll a critical success, you can provide for another additional creature. Furthermore, when you attempt a [Society](../skills.md#Society) check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about cultural practices and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
