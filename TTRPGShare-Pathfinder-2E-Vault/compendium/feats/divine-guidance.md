# Divine Guidance  *Feat 15*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)

You're so immersed in divine scripture that you find meaning and guidance in your texts in any situation. Spend 10 minutes [Deciphering Writing](../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md) on religious scriptures of your deity or philosophy while thinking about a particular problem or conundrum you face, and then attempt a [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) check (DC determined by the GM). If you succeed, you unearth a relevant passage, parable, or aphorism that can help you move forward or change your thinking to help solve your conundrum. For example, the GM might provide you with a cryptic poem or hint that can guide you to the next step of solving your problem.
