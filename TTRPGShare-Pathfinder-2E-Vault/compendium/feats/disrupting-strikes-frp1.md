# Disrupting Strikes  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Eater Dedication](ghost-eater-dedication-frp1.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You call forth positive energy from within to help you destroy undead. Your weapon and unarmed [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) gain the effects of a disrupting property rune until the start of your next turn.

If you're 14th level or higher, your [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) instead gain the effects of a greater disrupting property rune. The DC for the rune's effect is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
