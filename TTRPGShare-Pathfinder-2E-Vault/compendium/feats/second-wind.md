# Second Wind  *Feat 2*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  


You can enter a second rage, but afterward you need to catch your breath. You can [Rage](../../rules/actions/rage.md) without waiting for 1 minute after the previous [Rage](../../rules/actions/rage.md) (or 1 round, with quick rage), but when you end this second [Rage](../../rules/actions/rage.md), you're [fatigued](../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) until you rest for 10 minutes.
