# Fast Recovery  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Constitution 14

Your body quickly bounces back from afflictions. You regain twice as many Hit Points from resting. Each time you succeed at a Fortitude save against an ongoing [disease](../../rules/traits/disease.md) or [poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md), you reduce its stage by 2, or by 1 against a [virulent](../../rules/traits/virulent.md) disease or poison. Each critical success you achieve against an ongoing disease or poison reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 against a virulent disease or poison. In addition, you reduce the severity of your [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition by 2 when you rest for a night instead of by 1.
