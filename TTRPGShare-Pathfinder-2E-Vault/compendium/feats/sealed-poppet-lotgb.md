# Sealed Poppet  *Feat 5*  
[poppet](../../rules/traits/poppet-lotgb.md)  


You've reinforced your interior parts with sealant or other flame-retardant materials, protecting you from fire. You no longer have the weakness to fire from the flammable ability.

**Special.** You can't take this feat if you're a stuffed poppet.
