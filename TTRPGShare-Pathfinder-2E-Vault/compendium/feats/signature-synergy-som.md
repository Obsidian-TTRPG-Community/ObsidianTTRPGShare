# Signature Synergy  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Advanced Synergy](advanced-synergy-som.md)

Your eidolon gains an evolution integral to its form, and it comes more easily than your other synergies. You gain one evolution feat from the following list: Airborne Form, Burrowing Form, Ever-Vigilant Senses, or Hulking Size. For the purpose of meeting its prerequisites, your summoner level is equal to your character level – 4.
