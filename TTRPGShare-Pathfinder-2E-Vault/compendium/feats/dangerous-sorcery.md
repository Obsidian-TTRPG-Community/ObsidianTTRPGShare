# Dangerous Sorcery  *Feat 1*  
[sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  


Your legacy grants you great destructive power. When you [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from your spell slots, if the spell deals damage and doesn't have a duration, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage equal to the spell's level.
