# Cling  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 9*  
[goblin](../../rules/traits/goblin.md)  

- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You hang onto a foe to harry them into submission. If your target moves while you're hanging onto it, you can choose to move with the target. The target is released if you choose not to move with it, at the start of your next turn, or if the target [Escapes](../../rules/actions/escape.md). Attempts to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) from a Cling follow the rules for [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md), but use your [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) DC and end the Cling instead of the conditions normally ended by the [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) action.

**Special.** You can use this action without a free hand if your preceding [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) was made with your jaws or a similar unarmed attack you could use to hang on. The GM determines which unarmed attacks apply. Hanging on in this way prevents you from using that unarmed attack.
