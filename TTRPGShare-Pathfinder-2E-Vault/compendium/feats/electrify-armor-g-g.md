# Electrify Armor  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: armor innovation
- **Requirements**: You are wearing your armor innovation.
- **Activity** Single Action

You electrify your armor to punish foes who dare to attack you. For 1 round, any creature that touches you, or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or a non-reach melee weapon attack, takes `1d4` electricity damage. The effect ends if you cease wearing your armor innovation.

If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, the damage increases to `2d4`.

**Unstable Function** You create an unstable chain reaction, sending countless sparks dancing across your armor. Add the unstable trait to Electrify Armor. The effects last for 1 minute instead of 1 round, and the damage dice increase from d4s to d12s.
