# Cursed Effigy  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[curse](../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [esoterica](../../rules/traits/esoterica-da.md)  [thaumaturge](../../rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Exploit Vulnerability](../../rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the target of your [Exploit Vulnerability](../../rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md), and the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) dealt physical damage.
- **Activity** Single Action

After your attack, you grab a bit of blood, cut hair, or other piece of the creature's body. You incorporate the material into a premade doll, paper figure, or other effigy to create a sympathetic link that makes it harder to resist your abilities. As long as you are Exploiting Vulnerability against that creature, it takes a –2 status penalty to its saving throws against thaumaturge abilities or items that use your thaumaturge class DC.
