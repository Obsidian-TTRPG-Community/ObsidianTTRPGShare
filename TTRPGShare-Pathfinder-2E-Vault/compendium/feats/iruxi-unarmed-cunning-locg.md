# Iruxi Unarmed Cunning  *Feat 5*  
[lizardfolk](../../rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  


You make the most of your iruxi unarmed attacks. Whenever you score a critical hit with a claw or an unarmed attack you gained from a lizardfolk ancestry feat, you apply the unarmed attack's critical specialization effect.
