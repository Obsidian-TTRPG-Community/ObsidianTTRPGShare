# Expansive Spellstrike  *Feat 2*  
[magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)

You've adapted a wider array of spells to work with your attacks. Rather than needing to use a spell that has a spell attack roll for a [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md), you can use a harmful spell that can target a creature or that has an area of a burst, cone, or line (abiding by any other restrictions of [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)). When you [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that doesn't have a spell attack roll as part of a [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md), it works in the following ways.

- If your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) critically fails, the spell is lost with no effect.
- Creatures use their normal defenses against the spell, such as saving throws.
- If the spell lets you select a number of targets, it instead targets only the creature you attacked with your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
- If the spell has an area, the target must be in that area. A burst is centered on a corner of the target's square, or the square corner closest to the center of the target, if the target is Large or larger; you choose the corner if more than one is eligible. A cone or line emits from you and must include the target; if you're not adjacent to the target (using a [reach](../../rules/traits/reach.md) weapon or starlit span, for example), choose any square adjacent to the target as the source. The spell affects all creatures in the area as normal, but the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) still targets only one creature.
