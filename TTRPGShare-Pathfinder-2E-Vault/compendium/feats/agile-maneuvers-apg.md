# Agile Maneuvers  *Feat 6*  
[swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

Your easily maneuver against your foes. Your [Grapple](../../rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md), and [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) actions have a lower multiple attack penalty: –4 instead of –5 if they're the second attack on your turn, or –8 instead of –10 if they're the third or subsequent attack on your turn.
