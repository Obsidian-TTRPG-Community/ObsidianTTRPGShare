# Megavolt  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You bleed off some electric power from your innovation in the shape of a damaging bolt. Creatures in a 20-foot line from your innovation take `3d4` electricity damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The electricity damage increases by `1d4` at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

**Unstable Function** You overload and supercharge the voltage even higher. Add the unstable trait to Megavolt. The area increases to a 60-foot line and the damage increases from d4s to d12s.

If you have the breakthrough innovation|Inventor|G&G|7 class feature, you can choose a 60-foot or 90-foot line for the area when you use an unstable Megavolt; if you also have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot, 90-foot, or 120-foot line.

**Special.** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.
