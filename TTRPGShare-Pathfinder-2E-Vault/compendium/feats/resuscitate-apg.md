# Resuscitate  [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Medic Dedication](medic-dedication-apg.md), legendary in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: You are holding healer's tools or are wearing them and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You can use [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of [raise dead](../spells/raise-dead.md), except it still has the [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition it had before [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying), increased by 1 (or [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) if it wasn't [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) before [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying)). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.
