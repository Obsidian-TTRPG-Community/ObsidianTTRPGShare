> - **Critical Success** You gain the critical success effect of a [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md), then the critical success effect of a [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) against the target.
> - **Success** You gain the success effect of a [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md), then the success effect of a [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) against the target.
