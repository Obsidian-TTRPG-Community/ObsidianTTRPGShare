# Reflexive Riposte  *Feat 10*  
[swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: APG

You can riposte almost without a thought. At the start of each of your turns when you regain your actions, you gain an additional reaction that can be used only to perform an Opportune Riposte.
