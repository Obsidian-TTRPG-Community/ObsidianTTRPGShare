- **Access**: You're from Alkenstar or the Mana Wastes.
- **Prerequisites**: [Martial Artist Dedication](martial-artist-dedication-apg.md)

You infuse your handwraps with black powder. On your first melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) each round with an unarmed attack, [knuckle duster](../equipment/items/knuckle-duster-g-g.md), or [black powder knuckle dusters](../equipment/items/black-powder-knuckle-dusters-g-g.md), you deal an additional 1 fire damage. If you critically succeed at an attempt to [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) while in this stance, the target is pushed back an additional 5 feet.
