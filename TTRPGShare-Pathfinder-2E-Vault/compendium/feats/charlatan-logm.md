# Charlatan  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)

You've learned to mimic the abilities of spellcasters by studying their flourishes and words. When you activate a magic item to generate a spell effect, attempt a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check. If you succeed against an onlooker's [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC, to that onlooker, you appear to [Cast that Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) instead. Onlookers who successfully Recognize the Spell realize you used a magic item, though those who later successfully Identify the Magic still can't determine that the source of the effect was a magic item.
