# Ooze Empathy  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oozemorph Dedication](oozemorph-dedication-sli.md), at least two other class feats from the oozemorph archetype

You can connect with oozes (and other amorphous aberrations, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on oozes and to make very simple Requests of them. In most instances, oozes will give you time to make your case.
