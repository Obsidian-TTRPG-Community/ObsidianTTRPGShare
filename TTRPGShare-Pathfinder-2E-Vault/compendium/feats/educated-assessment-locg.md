# Educated Assessment  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [secret](../../rules/traits/secret.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You attempt to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about a creature, and the GM uses the same secret roll result against the creature's [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) or [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) DC, giving you the information from a [Battle Assessment](battle-assessment.md). You might get a different degree of success on the [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check than what you get for the Battle Assessment. If you have the Battle Assessment feat, you gain the effects of Educated Assessment whenever you [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) (such as with the [Automatic Knowledge](automatic-knowledge.md) feat)
