# Advantageous Assault  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](../../rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

When an enemy's movement is compromised, you deliver a more deadly blow. Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature that is [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained). You gain a circumstance bonus to damage on this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) equal to the number of weapon damage dice, or that number + 2 if you're wielding the weapon in two hands. The [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) gains the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** You deal damage to the target equal to the number of weapon damage dice, or that number + 2 if you're wielding the weapon in two hands. This damage has the same damage type as the weapon.
