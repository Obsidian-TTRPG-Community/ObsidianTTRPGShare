# Resurrectionist  *Feat 16*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  


You can cause a creature you bring back from the brink of death to thrive and continue healing. When you restore Hit Points to a [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature or bring a dead creature back to life and restore Hit Points to it, you grant that creature fast healing 5 for 1 minute. This fast healing ends if the creature is knocked [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).
