# Elven Aloofness  *Feat 1*  
[elf](../../rules/traits/elf.md)  


As much as you might care for them, you've come to terms with the ephemeral nature of non-elves, and it makes their threats feel less troublesome. If a non-elf rolls a failure on a check to [Coerce](../../rules/actions/coerce.md) you using [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation), it gets a critical failure instead (and thus can't try to [Coerce](../../rules/actions/coerce.md) you again for 1 week). When a non-elf attempts to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) you, you become temporarily immune for 1 day, instead of 10 minutes.
