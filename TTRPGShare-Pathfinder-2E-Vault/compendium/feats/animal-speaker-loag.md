# Animal Speaker  *Feat 5*  
[sprite](../../rules/traits/sprite-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to communicate with some type of animals (such as bats or arthropods)

You can speak to all animals, not just a particular subset. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on animals (which usually uses the [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) skill).
