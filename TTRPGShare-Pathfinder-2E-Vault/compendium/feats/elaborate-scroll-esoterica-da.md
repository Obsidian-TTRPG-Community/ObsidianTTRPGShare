[thaumaturge](../../rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Scroll Esoterica

You've picked up more scraps of magic texts, improving your makeshift scrolls. In addition to your daily scrolls from Scroll Esoterica, add a scroll with a 3rd-level spell. At 14th level, add a scroll with a 4th-level spell. At 16th level, add a scroll with a 5th-level spell.
