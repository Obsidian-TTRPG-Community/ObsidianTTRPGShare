# Enchanting Arrow  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Archer Dedication](eldritch-archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks.

Make a bow [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, the target takes an additional `2d6` mental damage. On a critical hit, the target also becomes [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned). The mental damage increases to `3d6` if your bow has a greater striking rune, or to `4d6` if your bow has a major striking rune.
