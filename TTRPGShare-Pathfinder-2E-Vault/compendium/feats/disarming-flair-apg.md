# Disarming Flair  *Feat 1*  
[swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  


It's harder for your foes to regain their grip when you knock their weapon partially out of their hands. When you succeed at an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md), the circumstance bonus and penalty from [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) last until the end of your next turn, instead of until the beginning of the target's next turn. The target can use an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to adjust their grip and remove this effect.

If your swashbuckler's style is gymnast and you succeed at your [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) a foe, you gain panache.
