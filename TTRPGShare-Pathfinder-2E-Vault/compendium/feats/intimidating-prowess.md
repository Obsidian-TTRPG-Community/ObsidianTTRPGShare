In situations where you can physically menace the target when you [Coerce](../../rules/actions/coerce.md) or [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check and you ignore the penalty for not sharing a language.
