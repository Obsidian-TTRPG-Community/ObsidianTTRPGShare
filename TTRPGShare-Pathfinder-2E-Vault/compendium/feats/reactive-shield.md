# Reactive Shield  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Trigger** An enemy hits you with a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a shield.
- **Activity** Reaction

You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the last second. You immediately use the [Raise a Shield](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) action and gain your shield's bonus to AC. The circumstance bonus from the shield applies to your AC when you're determining the outcome of the triggering attack.
