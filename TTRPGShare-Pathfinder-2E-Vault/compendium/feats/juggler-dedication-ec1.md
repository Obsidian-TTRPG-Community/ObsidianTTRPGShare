# Juggler Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Dexterity 14

You become trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance); if you were already trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the Juggle skill feat (page 76), even if you don't meet its prerequisites.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained one other feat from the juggler archetype.
