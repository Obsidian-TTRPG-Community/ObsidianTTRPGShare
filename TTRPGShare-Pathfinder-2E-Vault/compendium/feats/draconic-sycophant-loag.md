# Draconic Sycophant  *Feat 1*  
[kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  


You have an affect that dragonkind find unusually pleasing—and when that fails, you know when to duck. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks and saving throws against dragons. In addition, whenever you meet a creature with the [dragon](../../rules/traits/dragon.md) trait in a social situation, you can attempt a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on that creature immediately, rather than after conversing for 1 minute; you take a –5 penalty to this check. If you fail, you can choose to engage in 1 minute of conversation and then attempt a new check rather than accept the failure or critical failure result.

**Special.** If you have the [Glad-Hand](glad-hand.md) skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check if the target has the [dragon](../../rules/traits/dragon.md) trait.
