# Graceful Leaper  *Feat 7*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](acrobat-dedication-apg.md), master in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics)

Mass and muscle are meaningless when you leap; only grace and balance matter. You can roll an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check instead of an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check when making a [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md).
