[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Captivator Dedication](captivator-dedication-lotgb.md)

Your innate ability to fascinate others develops into full-fledged spellcasting. This spellcasting comes naturally and instinctively to you, rather than as a product of training.

Choose a 1st-level occult spell from either the enchantment or illusion school. You can [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) as an occult innate spell. At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-level spell, and at 8th level, you gain a 3rd-level spell. Each of these spells must be from either the enchantment or illusion school.

## Basic Captivator Spellcasting leads to...
