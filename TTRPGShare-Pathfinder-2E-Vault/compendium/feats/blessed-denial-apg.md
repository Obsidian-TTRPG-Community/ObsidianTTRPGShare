# Blessed Denial  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Blessed One Dedication](blessed-one-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would become [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained), [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), or [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied).
- **Activity** Reaction

You exude peace and protection, lessening a harmful condition as it falls upon an ally. Reduce the value of the condition your ally would take by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If the ally takes more than one condition at the same time, choose one to reduce.
