# Keep Up Appearances  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[human](../../rules/traits/human.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Taldan nationality
- **Trigger** You are affected by an [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

Taldan pride means you never show weakness. Roll a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check and compare the result to any observing creatures' [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DCs. On a success, that creature believes you were unaffected by the [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effect. A creature tricked in this manner can't benefit from the [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effect and can't use abilities that require you to be under this [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effect; for example, if you successfully use this ability to trick a will-o'-wisp into believing you aren't under a [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effect, it can't use its Feed on Fear ability on you.
