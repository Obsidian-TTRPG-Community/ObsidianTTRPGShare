[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Warden](shield-warden-champion.md)

You protect an ally with both your shield and your body. Whenever you use the [Shield Block](shield-block.md) reaction to prevent damage to an ally, you can evenly split the remaining damage after the [Shield Block](shield-block.md) between the ally and yourself.
