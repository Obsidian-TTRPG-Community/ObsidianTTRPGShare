# Thaumaturge Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [multiclass](../../rules/traits/multiclass.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 14

You've uncovered basic thaumaturgy. You become trained in thaumaturge class DC. Choose an first implement and esoterica|thaumaturge|DA|1||implement; you can use it to Glimpse Vulnerability, but don't gain its benefits. You also gain a few esoterica, allowing you to use [esoterica](../../rules/traits/esoterica-da.md) actions. You become trained in your choice of [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../skills.md#Religion); if you were already trained in these, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the Glimpse Vulnerability action.

- **Requirements**: You are holding your implement

**Effect** You glimpse a hidden vulnerability and then strengthen it to aid you. Select a creature you can see. Until you Glimpse Vulnerability again, that target gains weakness 2 against your unarmed and weapon [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).
