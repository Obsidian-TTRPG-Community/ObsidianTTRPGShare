# Bonded Animal  *Feat 2*  
[downtime](../../rules/traits/downtime.md)  [general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)

You forge strong connections with animals. You can spend 7 days of downtime trying to bond with a normal animal (not a companion or other special animal) that is [friendly](../../rules/conditions.md#Friendly) or [helpful](../../rules/conditions.md#Helpful) to you. After this duration, attempt a DC 20 [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) check. If successful, you bond with the animal. The animal is permanently [helpful](../../rules/conditions.md#Helpful) to you, unless you do something egregious to break your bond. A [helpful](../../rules/conditions.md#Helpful) animal is easier to direct, as described under [Command an Animal](../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md).

Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had. You can't have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (though you can have both a bonded animal and a familiar).
