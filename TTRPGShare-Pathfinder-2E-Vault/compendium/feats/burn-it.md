# Burn It!  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](../../rules/traits/goblin.md)  


Fire fascinates you. Your spells and [alchemical](../../rules/traits/alchemical.md) items that deal fire damage gain a status bonus to damage equal to half the spell's level or one-quarter the item's level (minimum 1). You also gain a +1 status bonus to any [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you deal.
