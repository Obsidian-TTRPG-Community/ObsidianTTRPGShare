# Defensive Coordination  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: warrior muse, [Inspire Defense](inspire-defense.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

Like the storied heroes who persist in the face of overwhelming odds, you and your allies will hold the line.

If your next action is to cast the [inspire defense](../spells/inspire-defense.md) composition cantrip, you can [Raise a Shield](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), and one ally who gains a status bonus from the spell can immediately use a reaction to [Raise a Shield](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md).
