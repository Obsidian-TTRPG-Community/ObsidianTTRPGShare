# Stage Fighting  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Gladiator Dedication](gladiator-dedication-apg.md)

You pull punches to give a better show. You don't take the usual –2 circumstance penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon or unarmed attack that doesn't have the [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait.
