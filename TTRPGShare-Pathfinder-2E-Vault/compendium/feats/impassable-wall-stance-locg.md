# Impassable Wall Stance  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Attack of Opportunity](../../rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You refuse to let foes past your guard. As long as you are in this stance, when you critically hit with an [Attack of Opportunity](../../rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) triggered by a move action, you disrupt that move action.
