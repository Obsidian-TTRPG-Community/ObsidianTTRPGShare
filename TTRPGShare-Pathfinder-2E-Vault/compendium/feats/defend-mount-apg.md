# Defend Mount  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cavalier Dedication](cavalier-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An enemy makes an attack roll against your mount while you're riding it.
- **Activity** Reaction

You interpose yourself between an attacker and your mount, defending your mount from harm. Use your own AC against the triggering attack instead your mount's AC. If the triggering attack hits, you take the effects of the attack instead of your mount.
