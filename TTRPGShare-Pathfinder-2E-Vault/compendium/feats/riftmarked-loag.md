# Riftmarked  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


Long ago, [qlippoth](../../rules/traits/qlippoth-b2.md) marked someone in your lineage, most likely through their ancient runestones that dot Golarion's surface. Yours is an old lineage, primordial and twisted, and you have a sense for similarly twisted things. You're trained in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism). If you're already trained in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [Oddity Identification](oddity-identification.md) skill feat.

## Riftmarked leads to...

[Qlippoth Magic](qlippoth-magic-loag.md)
