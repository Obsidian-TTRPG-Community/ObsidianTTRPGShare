# Defy The Darkness  *Feat 5*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: darkvision

Using ancient dwarven methods developed to fight enemies wielding magical darkness, you've honed your [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) and sworn not to use such magic yourself. You gain [greater darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md), enabling you to see through magical darkness even if it normally hampers [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) (such as the darkness created by a 4th-level [darkness](../spells/darkness.md) spell). You can't cast spells with the [darkness](../../rules/traits/darkness.md) trait, use item activations with the [darkness](../../rules/traits/darkness.md) trait, or use any other ability with the [darkness](../../rules/traits/darkness.md) trait.
