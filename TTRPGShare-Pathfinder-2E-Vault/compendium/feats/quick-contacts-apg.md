# Quick Contacts  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Society](../skills.md#Society); [Connections](connections.md) or Underworld Connections

You know where to go, who to talk to, and how to make new connections, fast. Upon entering a new settlement, spending 1 day of downtime allows you to build enough connections to make use of the [Connections](connections.md) or [Underworld Connections](criminal-connections-apg.md) feats. If you're legendary in [Society](../skills.md#Society), you can form the required connections within 1 hour of entering a new settlement.
