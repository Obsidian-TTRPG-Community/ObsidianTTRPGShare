# Ongoing Selfishness  *Feat 1*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: desecrator cause

Your powerful personality and incredible ego demand that you protect yourself above all else. After you use [Selfish Shield](../../rules/actions/selfish-shield-apg.md), you gain resistance to all further damage from the triggering enemy until the end of the turn on which you used the reaction. This resistance is equal to half your [Selfish Shield](../../rules/actions/selfish-shield-apg.md) resistance.
