# Leshy Familiar  *Feat 1*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Leaf order

You gain a leshy familiar, a Tiny plant or fungus that embodies one of the many spirits of nature. Other than taking the form of a plant or fungus instead of an animal, this familiar uses all the same rules as other familiars, which are detailed on page 217.
