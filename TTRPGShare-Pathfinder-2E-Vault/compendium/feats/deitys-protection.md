# Deity's Protection  *Feat 14*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Advanced Domain](advanced-domain.md)

When you call upon your deity's power to fulfill the promise of their domain, you gain divine protection. After you cast a domain spell, you gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn. The amount of resistance is equal to the level of the domain spell you cast.
