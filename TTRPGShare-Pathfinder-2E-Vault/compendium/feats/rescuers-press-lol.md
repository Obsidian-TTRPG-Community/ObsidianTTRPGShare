# Rescuer's Press  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md)

Any shield you wield gains the [shove](../../rules/traits/shove.md) trait. When you [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) using a shield and [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) as part of that action, you can move an additional 5 feet to either side of the creature you Shoved. In addition, if you are in the [Everstand Stance](everstand-stance-locg.md) and successfully [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) a creature using a shield that you wield two-handed, you can increase the distance of your [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) to 10 feet.
