# Flourish And Ruin  *Feat 17*  
[leshy](../../rules/traits/leshy-b1.md)  


You can call upon the vital essence of your spirit to restore life to your allies and call forth vines to ensnare and bludgeon your foes.

You can cast [field of life](../spells/field-of-life.md) and [tangling creepers](../spells/tangling-creepers.md) as 6th-level primal innate spells once per day each. You become an expert in primal spell attack rolls and primal spell DCs.
