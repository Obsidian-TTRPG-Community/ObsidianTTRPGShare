# Resounding Bravery  *Feat 8*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: bravery

Even your fears serve as fuel for your fighting spirit. When you critically succeed at a Will save against a foe's ability, you gain a +1 status bonus to saves and a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level for 1 minute. These benefits are doubled if you critically succeed against a [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effect.
