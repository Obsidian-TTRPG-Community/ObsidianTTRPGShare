# Vampire Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: You were a killed by a vampire drinking your blood.

You're a newly risen vampire. You gain the [undead](../../rules/traits/undead.md) and [vampire](../../rules/traits/vampire-b1.md) traits and the basic undead benefits (page 44), and your undead hunger is for the blood of the living. Your incisors elongate; you gain a fangs unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage. They're in the brawling group and have the [grapple](../../rules/traits/grapple.md) and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits. You gain revulsion and sunlight vulnerabilities detailed on page 59 and the Drink Blood ability.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Drink Blood [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[divine](../../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Requirements**: A [grabbed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [paralyzed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [restrained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained), [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), or willing creature is within your reach

**Effect** You sink your fangs into that creature and drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is [grabbed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), and automatically succeeds for any of the other conditions. If you succeed, the creature becomes [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained), and you gain temporary HP equal to the target's level that last for 10 minutes. Further uses against the target don't increase the [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition or grant you more temporary HP.
