# Flying Kick  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You launch yourself at a foe. Make a [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) or attempt a [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md). At the end of the jump, if you're adjacent to a foe, you can immediately [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that foe with an unarmed attack, even if the foe is in mid-air. You fall to the ground after the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If the distance you fall is no more than the height of your jump, you land upright and take no damage.
