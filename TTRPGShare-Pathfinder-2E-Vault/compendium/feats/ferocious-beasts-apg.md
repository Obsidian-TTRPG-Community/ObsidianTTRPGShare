# Ferocious Beasts  *Feat 13*  
[orc](../../rules/traits/orc.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Beast Trainer](beast-trainer-apg.md) or animal companion, [Orc Ferocity](orc-ferocity.md)

Since ancient times, the mightiest orc beast tamers would draw out the true fighting spirit of their companion beasts by feeding the creatures a draft incorporating the orc's own blood. Animal companions or bonded animals you have gain the [Orc Ferocity](orc-ferocity.md) feat, and they gain a reaction they can use only for [Orc Ferocity](orc-ferocity.md). If you have the [Undying Ferocity](undying-ferocity-apg.md) ancestry feat, all animal companions or bonded animals you have also gain the benefits of that feat when using the [Orc Ferocity](orc-ferocity.md) reaction.
