# Thaumaturge's Demesne  *Feat 12*  
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [thaumaturge](../../rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You have claimed an area or location as your demesne, granting you the ability to ward and protect it. When you select this feat, choose a demesne, an area of no more than 2,000 square feet. You must legitimately own the area or, if its a public area, you must lay claim to the area without anyone contesting it.

Once you've chosen your demesne, it's automatically protected by an arcane [private sanctum](../spells/private-sanctum.md) spell with an unlimited duration, heightened to half your level rounded up and using your thaumaturge class DC in place of a spell DC, if necessary. Additionally, the demesne is attended by three unseen custodians, as a successful unseen custodian ritual (Advanced Player's Guide 245), and one object in the area gains an elemental sentinel, as a successful elemental sentinel ritual (Pathfinder Secrets of Magic 150).
