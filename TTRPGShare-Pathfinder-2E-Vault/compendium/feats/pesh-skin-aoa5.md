# Pesh Skin  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [morph](../../rules/traits/morph.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are transformed into a plant by a polymorph spell.
- **Activity** Single Action

Your plant form sprouts hundreds of spines, and your blood causes mild hallucinations in creatures exposed to it. Each time a creature touches you, hits you with an unarmed attack, or hits you with a melee weapon attack while adjacent to you, that creature takes `1d6` piercing damage. Increase the damage to `2d6` if the polymorph spell is 8th level or higher, or to `3d6` if it's 10th level.

When an adjacent creature damages you with piercing or slashing damage, it must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or become [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) (or [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical failure) until the end of its next turn.

These benefits last until you're no longer polymorphed into a plant.
