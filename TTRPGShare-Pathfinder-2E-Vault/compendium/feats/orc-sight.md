# Orc Sight  *Feat 1*  
[half-orc](../../rules/traits/half-orc.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [low-light vision](../../rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md)

Your orc blood is strong enough to grant you the keen vision of your orc forebears. You gain [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md), allowing you to see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can in bright light. However, in darkness, you see in black and white only.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
