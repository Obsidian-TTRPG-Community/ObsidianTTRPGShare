# Blessed Spell  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Blessed One Dedication](blessed-one-dedication-apg.md), ability to cast spells from spell slots, [Mercy](mercy.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Activity** Single Action

When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove harmful conditions. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally, you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed by your [Mercy](mercy.md) feat, including those granted by later feats such as [Greater Mercy](greater-mercy.md). Attempt a counteract check based on the spell's DC and level. This effect is in addition to the normal effects of your spell.
