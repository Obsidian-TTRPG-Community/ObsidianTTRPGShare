# Wayfinder Resonance Infiltrator  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md), [Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer](wayfinder-resonance-tinkerer-lowg.md) (World Guide 23)

You are adept at using the unusual resonance of your wayfinder to aid in any deceptions you might employ. Once per day you can activate your wayfinder to cast [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md), heightened to 2nd level, as an arcane spell. Additionally, once per day, you can Activate your wayfinder with a single-action envision activation to transform it into a perfect replica of another similarly sized badge of membership or office, such as an Aspis Consortium badge. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.
