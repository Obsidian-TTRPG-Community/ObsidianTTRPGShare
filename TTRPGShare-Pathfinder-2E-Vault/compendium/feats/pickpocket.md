# Pickpocket  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery)

You can [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md) or [Palm an Object](../../rules/actions/palm-an-object.md) that's closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty. You can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you're a master in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery), you can attempt to [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md) from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, Stealing requires 2 manipulate actions instead of 1, and you take a –5 penalty.

## Pickpocket leads to...

[Legendary Thief](legendary-thief.md), [Steal Spell](steal-spell-apg.md), [Plant Evidence](plant-evidence-apg.md), [Larcenous Hand](larcenous-hand-lotgb.md)
