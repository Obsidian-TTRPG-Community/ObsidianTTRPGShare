# Tumbling Opportunist  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](acrobat-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to [Tumble Through](../../rules/actions/tumble-through.md) or Tumbling [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), and you successfully moved through an enemy's space.
- **Activity** Free Action

You use a burst of stamina to perform a breathtaking feat of [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) as you speed through a foe's space, leaving your foe lying flat on their back. You attempt to [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) instead of [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) for this check.
