# Automatic Knowledge  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in a skill with the [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action, [Assurance](assurance.md) in that skill

You know basic facts off the top of your head. Choose a skill you're an expert in that has the [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action and for which you have the [Assurance](assurance.md) feat. You can use the [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action with that skill as a free action once per round. If you do, you must use [Assurance](assurance.md) on the skill check.

**Special.** You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different skill each time. You can use Automatic Knowledge with any skills you have chosen, but you can still use Automatic Knowledge only once per round.
