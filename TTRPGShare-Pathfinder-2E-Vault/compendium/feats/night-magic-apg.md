# Night Magic  *Feat 9*  
[dhampir](../../rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md)  


You can tap into the magic that runs through your blood. You gain [animal form](../spells/animal-form.md) (wolf only, using the statistics for a canine) and [obscuring mist](../spells/obscuring-mist.md) as 2nd-level divine innate spells. You can cast each of these spells once per day.
