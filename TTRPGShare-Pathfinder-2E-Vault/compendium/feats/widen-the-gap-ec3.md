# Widen The Gap  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Turpin Rowe Lumberjack Dedication](turpin-rowe-lumberjack-dedication-ec3.md)

Once you have penetrated a foe's defenses, you can home in on the same spot to exploit your opponent's wound and deal some serious damage. The second time you hit and deal damage with a melee axe [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) to the same opponent or object during your turn, you ignore half of the opponent's or object's Hardness, if any. If you hit and deal damage with a melee axe [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) to the same opponent or object a third or fourth time during your turn, you ignore all of its Hardness, if any.
