# Alchemical Savant  *Feat 1*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) skill to [Identify Alchemy](../../rules/actions/identify-alchemy.md) on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) and [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) traits, instead of spending 10 minutes. If you have the formula for the item you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
