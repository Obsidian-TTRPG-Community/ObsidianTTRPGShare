# Instant Return  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 16*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Trigger** An enemy misses you with a ranged attack using a type of ammunition appropriate to your weapon (a bullet if you're wielding a firearm).
- **Requirements**: You're wielding an unloaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Reaction

With a single fluid gesture, you catch a projectile out of the air, load it in your weapon, and shoot it back at the attacker.

[Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to load the projectile into your weapon, then make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon against the triggering opponent. Since you're using the foe's ammunition, this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) applies any special effects that ammunition would have (for instance, if it was explosive ammunition, it would explode in a burst of fire if your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits).
