# Noble Resolve  *Feat 5*  
[ifrit](../../rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md)  [oread](../../rules/traits/oread-b2.md)  [suli](../../rules/traits/suli-b2.md)  [sylph](../../rules/traits/sylph-b2.md)  [undine](../../rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  


Once, genies ruled vast kingdoms, and a remnant of that confidence and power is reflected in your strong will. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves against effects with the [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) trait. Regardless of success or failure, you become aware of the person who used the effect on you if they were visible to you at the time of use.
