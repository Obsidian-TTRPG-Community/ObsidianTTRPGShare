# Combination Finisher  *Feat 6*  
[swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  


You combine a series of attacks with a powerful finishing blow.

Your finishers' [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) have a lower multiple attack penalty: –4 (or –3 with an agile weapon) if it's the second attack on your turn, or –8 (or –6 with an agile weapon) if it's the third or subsequent attack on your turn, instead of –5 and –10, respectively.
