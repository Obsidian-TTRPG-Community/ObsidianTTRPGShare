# Persistent Boost  *Feat 16*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9|offensive boosts

Your innovation sets foes on fire, covers them in acid, leaves barbed thorns behind, or otherwise deals [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to your foes that sticks around long after you deliver your boosted attack. When you or your construct innovation damage a foe with offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9|offensive boosts, that foe also takes `1d8` [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) of the same damage type as the offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9|offensive boosts damage.
