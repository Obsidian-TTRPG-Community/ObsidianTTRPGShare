# Vampire Lore  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](../../rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md)  


You were raised by your vampiric parent, or you've invested substantial time and energy researching the secrets of your undead progenitors. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) and [Society](../skills.md#Society). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Vampire Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
