# Foil Senses  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)

You are adept at foiling creatures' special senses and cautious enough to safeguard against them at all times. Whenever you use the [Avoid Notice](../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md), [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md), or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) actions, you are always considered to be taking precautions against special senses (see the Detecting with Other Senses sidebar on page 465).
