# Hefting Shadow  *Feat 9*  
[conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [fetchling](../../rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [shadow](../../rules/traits/shadow.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clever Shadow](clever-shadow-loag.md)

Your shadow can contain objects. You can [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) with your shadow to store or retrieve objects, just like you would a mundane container (meaning you spend two [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) actions total to store and then retrieve the object, for example). Your shadow can contain 2 Bulk of objects, which don't count toward the Bulk you're carrying. The items remain solid but take on a shadowy patina while stored this way. Though the items are in your shadow and can be detected normally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks to Conceal the Objects unless someone knows to check your shadow for items.
