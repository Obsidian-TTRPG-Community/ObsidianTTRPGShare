# Barbarian Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [multiclass](../../rules/traits/multiclass.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Strength 14, Constitution 14

You become trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics); if you were already trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC.

You can use the [Rage](../../rules/actions/rage.md) action.

Choose an instinct|Barbarian||1 as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the barbarian archetype.

## Barbarian Dedication leads to...

[Barbarian Resiliency](barbarian-resiliency.md), [Basic Fury](basic-fury.md), [Advanced Fury](advanced-fury.md), [Instinct Ability](instinct-ability.md), [Juggernaut's Fortitude](juggernauts-fortitude.md)
