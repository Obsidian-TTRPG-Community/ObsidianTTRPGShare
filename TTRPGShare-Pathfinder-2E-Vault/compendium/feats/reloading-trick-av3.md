# Reloading Trick  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Drow Shootist Dedication](drow-shootist-dedication-av3.md)
- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You're holding an unloaded [hand crossbow](../equipment/items/hand-crossbow.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You can fire off a single shot even when unprepared. You [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to reload your hand crossbow and [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with it.

**Special.** If you have the [Repeating Hand Crossbow Training](repeating-hand-crossbow-training-av3.md) feat, you can use this feat with a [repeating hand crossbow](../equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md) to load either a bolt or a magazine, but the speed means you can fire only one bolt, then the magazine jams. You must spend a 3-action [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) activity to remove the jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.
