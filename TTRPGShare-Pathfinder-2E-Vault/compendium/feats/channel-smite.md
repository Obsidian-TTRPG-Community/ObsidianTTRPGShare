# Channel Smite  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font
- **Cost**: Expend a [harm](../spells/harm.md) or [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You siphon the destructive energies of positive or negative energy through a melee attack and into your foe. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) and add the spell's damage to the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage. This is negative damage if you expended a [harm](../spells/harm.md) spell or positive damage if you expended a [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell. The spell is expended with no effect if your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) fails or hits a creature that isn't damaged by that energy type (such as if you hit a non-undead creature with a [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell).
