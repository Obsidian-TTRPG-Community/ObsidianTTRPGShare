# Water Nagaji  *Feat 1*  
[nagaji](../../rules/traits/nagaji-loil.md)  


Much like a water naga, you've formed a connection to a sacred or pristine body of water, either as a home or a place to protect. You gain the [Breath Control](breath-control.md) general feat as a bonus feat and a swim Speed of 10 feet.
