# Cloud Jump  *Feat 15*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

You unparalleled athletic skill allows you to jump impossible distances. Triple the distance you [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) (so you could jump 60 feet on a successful DC 20 check). When you [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md), use the calculation for a [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) but don't triple the distance.

You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) or [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md). For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the limit on how far you can Leap.[^1]

[^1]: As an example, supposing you had a Speed of 40 feet and 25 on your [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check, Cloud Jump triples the 25 feet to 75 feet, but the limit of 40 feet still applies so you would jump 40 feet. If you spent another action, the limit based on your Speed would raise from 40 feet to 80 feet, so you would jump 75 feet. (Pathfinder Core Rulebook Errata (https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq))
