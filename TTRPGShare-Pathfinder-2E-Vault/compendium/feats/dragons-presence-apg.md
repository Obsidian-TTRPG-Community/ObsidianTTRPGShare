# Dragon's Presence  *Feat 1*  
[kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  


As a member of dragonkind, you project unflappable confidence (that collapses catastrophically against the deadliest foes)

When you roll a success on a saving throw against a [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effect, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a failure against a [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effect, you get a critical failure instead.

In addition, when you attempt to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) a foe of your level or lower, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check.
