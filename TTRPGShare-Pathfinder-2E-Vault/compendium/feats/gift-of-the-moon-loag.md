# Gift Of The Moon  *Feat 13*  
[beastkin](../../rules/traits/beastkin-loag.md)  


You can share your power with others, but they can't escape the werecreature's curse as easily as you can. You can cast a 5th-level [moon frenzy](../spells/moon-frenzy.md) as a primal innate spell once per day. At 15th level, you cast a 6th-level [moon frenzy](../spells/moon-frenzy.md) instead. At 17th level, your 6th-level [moon frenzy](../spells/moon-frenzy.md) grants its standard effects, except the temporary Hit Points increase to 15 and the silver weakness increases to 15. At 20th level, you cast a 10th-level [moon frenzy](../spells/moon-frenzy.md) instead.

The spell uses your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
