# Ubiquitous Overdrive  *Feat 20*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Shared [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md)

You prepare a variety of incredible gizmos on each of your allies, linking them together through careful modification to enable you to power them up all at once. During your daily preparations, select up to six willing allies. Whenever you [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md), you grant the benefits of your overdrive to any of these allies you choose who are within 30 feet of you. The allies don't gain the increased damage from expert, master, or legendary overdrive.

Construct Companions A construct companion is a loyal semi-sentient construct who follows your orders obediently and is roughly as intelligent as an animal. Your construct companion has the [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md) trait, and it gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command a Minion action to command it.

If your companion is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) check with a high DC for your level. On a success, you rebuild your companion. You can have only one construct companion at a time, and you can have either a construct companion or an animal companion, but not both.
