# Enshroud Soul Cage  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lich Dedication](lich-dedication-botd.md)

You wreathe your [soul cage](../equipment/items/soul-cage-botd.md) in an ever-growing collection of obfuscating illusions and protective abjurations to hide it from your enemies. You disguise the soul cage as any non-magical object of the same Bulk, and it gains the effects of the [magic aura](../spells/magic-aura.md) and [nondetection](../spells/nondetection.md) spells. The effects have unlimited durations, are heightened to half your level rounded up, and use your spell DC against any attempt to counteract them. The magic aura makes your soul cage appear non-magical. You can ignore the effects of any of these spells when dealing with your own soul cage. You are mentally alerted whenever your soul cage is damaged.
