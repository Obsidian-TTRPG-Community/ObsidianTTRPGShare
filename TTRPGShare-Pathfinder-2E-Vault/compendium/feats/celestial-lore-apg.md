# Celestial Lore  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  


You were raised with an aasimar or celestial relative, or you've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the celestial realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Religion](../skills.md#Religion). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill related to the celestial realm from which you trace your lineage (usually [Elysium Lore](../skills.md#Lore), [Heaven Lore](../skills.md#Lore), or [Nirvana Lore](../skills.md#Lore)).
