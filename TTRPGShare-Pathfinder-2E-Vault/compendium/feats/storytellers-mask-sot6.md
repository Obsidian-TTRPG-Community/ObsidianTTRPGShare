# Storyteller's Mask  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [wizard](../../rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask remembers the stories of Shifting Frog, Storyteller of the Past and Future. You can cast [foresight](../spells/foresight.md) once per day as an innate spell, either arcane if you have Wizard Dedication or primal if you have Druid Dedication, but the duration is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour.

Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only a single foe, you can [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about that foe.
