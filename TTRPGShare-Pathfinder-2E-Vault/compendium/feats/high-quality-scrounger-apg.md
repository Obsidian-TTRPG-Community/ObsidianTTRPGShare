# High-quality Scrounger  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scrounger Dedication](scrounger-dedication-apg.md)

When you [Craft](../../rules/actions/craft.md) a temporary item using Scrounger Dedication, it can be an item of up to 3rd level (though the item must still be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable piece of adventuring gear). You can instead [Craft](../../rules/actions/craft.md) it for someone else's use, allowing them to avoid taking the penalty for using a shoddy item when using it, but causing you to take the penalty if you use it.
