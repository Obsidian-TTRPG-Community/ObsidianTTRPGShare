# Emberkin  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


A peri's roaring spirit burns in your soul. Peris engage in constant struggle to right the wrongs of their fallen forebears, and that struggle has been passed on to you. You have a direct impulse to right wrongs and better the world. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md) effects, and your perception is unaffected by non-magical flames, fog and smoke.

## Emberkin leads to...

[Flame Jump](flame-jump-loag.md), [Peri Magic](peri-magic-loag.md)
