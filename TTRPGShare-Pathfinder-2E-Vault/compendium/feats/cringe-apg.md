# Cringe  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature you are aware of critically succeeds on a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against you and would deal damage to you.
- **Activity** Reaction

With pitiful posturing, you cause your foe to pull back a deadly attack. The attacking creature takes a circumstance penalty to the damage of the triggering [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) equal to your level + 2. This penalty applies after doubling the damage for a critical hit. The attacker is then immune to your Cringe for 24 hours.
