# Kobold Breath  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You channel your draconic exemplar's power into a gout of energy that manifests as a 30-foot line or a 15-foot cone, dealing `1d4` damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can't use this ability again for `1d4` rounds.

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by `1d4`. The shape of the breath, the damage type, and the saving throw match those of your draconic exemplar (see Table 1–1). This ability has the trait associated with the type of damage it deals.

## Kobold Breath leads to...

[Dragon's Breath](dragons-breath-apg.md), [Dragonblood Paragon](dragonblood-paragon-loag.md)
