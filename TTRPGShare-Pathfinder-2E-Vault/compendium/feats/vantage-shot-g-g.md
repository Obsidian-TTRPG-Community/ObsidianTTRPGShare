# Vantage Shot  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)

You and your spotter take advantage of each other's attacks to momentarily hide and throw your foes off-balance against your follow-up attack. When you successfully make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe, your spotter can use a reaction to attempt a [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check against the foe's [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC.

On a success, the foe is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the spotter's next attack before the end of your spotter's next turn. Similarly, when your spotter successfully makes a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe, you can use a reaction to attempt a [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check against the foe's [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC. On a success, the foe is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your next attack against them before the end of your next turn.
