# Twist The Knife  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Requirements**: Your last action was a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that dealt sneak attack damage to a [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) target.
- **Activity** Single Action

After stabbing your opponent in a weak spot, you tear the wound open. You deal [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to the target equal to your number of sneak attack damage dice.
