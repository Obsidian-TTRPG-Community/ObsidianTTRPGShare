# Inspired Stratagem  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md)  [rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Trigger** One of the required allies is about to attempt an attack roll or skill check.
- **Requirements**: You spent 10 minutes during your daily preparations reviewing stratagems for the day's adventures with up to four allies.
- **Activity** Reaction

You quickly advise your ally, using your earlier planning to make sure luck can't throw a wrench in the cogs of your schemes. The ally rolls the triggering check twice and takes the better of the two results. That ally then becomes temporarily immune to your Inspired Stratagem until your next daily preparations.
