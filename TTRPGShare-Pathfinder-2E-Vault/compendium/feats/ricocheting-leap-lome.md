# Ricocheting Leap  *Feat 9*  
[grippli](../../rules/traits/grippli-b2.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics), [Wall Jump](wall-jump.md)

You quickly use your momentum to topple and spring off of foes. You can use Wall Jump to make additional jumps off of creatures larger than you as if they were walls.

Once per turn when you make an additional jump off of a creature in this way, you can also attempt to [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) or [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) that creature as a free action.
