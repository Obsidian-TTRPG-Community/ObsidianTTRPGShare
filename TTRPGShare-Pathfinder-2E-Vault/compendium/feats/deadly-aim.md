# Deadly Aim  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[open](../../rules/traits/open.md)  [ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: weapon specialization
- **Activity** Single Action

You aim for your prey's weak spots, making your shot more challenging but dealing more damage if you hit. Make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against your hunted prey at a –2 penalty. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to damage on that [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). This bonus increases to +6 at 11th level and +8 at 15th level.
