# Consecrate Spell  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [oracle](../../rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Prerequisites**: ability to cast focus spells, divine spells
- **Activity** Single Action

You infuse a spell with the power of your faith, consecrating it. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that targets a single undead, you can expend a Focus Point, channeling the power of your focus spells into the primary spell. If you do, the spell you cast deals additional good or positive damage (your choice) equal to the level of your focus spells. As normal for additional damage, this additional damage is doubled if the spell cast requires an attack roll and the result of the attack roll is a critical hit, or if the spell cast requires a saving throw and the result of the saving throw is a critical failure.
