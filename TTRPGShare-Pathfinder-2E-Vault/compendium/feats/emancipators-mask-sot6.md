# Emancipator's Mask  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [wizard](../../rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask grants you the abilities of Whistling Kite, the Vigilant Seer, who emancipated thousands. When you are attempting a check to free someone else from an effect that immobilizes, paralyzes, or controls them, roll twice and take the higher result; this is a [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect. The GM might decide that this [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect applies when attempting checks to remove other conditions or effects to free another. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to permit the target to make an attempt to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md)
