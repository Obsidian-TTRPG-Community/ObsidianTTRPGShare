# Experienced Professional  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Lore](../skills.md#Lore)

You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent disaster. When you use [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) to [Earn Income](../../rules/actions/earn-income.md), if you roll a critical failure, you instead get a failure. If you're an expert in [Lore](../skills.md#Lore), you gain twice as much income from a failed check to [Earn Income](../../rules/actions/earn-income.md), unless it was originally a critical failure.
