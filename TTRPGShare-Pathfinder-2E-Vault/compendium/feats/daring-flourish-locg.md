# Daring Flourish  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Daring Act](daring-act-locg.md)

You make quick use of an opening from your daring stunts. At the end of a successful Daring Act, you can make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the target or attempt to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) the target. The target is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) you make during Daring Act as well as the next melee attack you attempt against it before the end of your turn.
