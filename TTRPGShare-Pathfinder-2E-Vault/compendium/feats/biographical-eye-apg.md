# Biographical Eye  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [secret](../../rules/traits/secret.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Society](../skills.md#Society)

In even a brief conversation or social interaction, you pick up on subtle social and visual cues to learn a great deal about a person's origin and history. You might notice bits of green under the person's fingernails and determine they're an herbalist, a pin indicating their membership in a secret society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city district where a vampire lives, but wouldn't learn any of their weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire.

Spend 1 minute in the presence of someone you haven't met before, or haven't met since you first gained Biographical Eye, then attempt a DC 30 [Society](../skills.md#Society) check. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check if you engaged the person in conversation during this time. If the person is deliberately trying to conceal their nature or present a false identity, you learn about their false biography rather than their true one unless the result of your [Society](../skills.md#Society) check exceeds their Will DC.
