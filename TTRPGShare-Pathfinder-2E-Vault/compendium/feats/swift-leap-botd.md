# Swift Leap  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghoul Dedication](ghoul-dedication-botd.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

Your undead physiology allows you to leap quickly toward or away from your opponent. You [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md). This movement doesn't trigger reactions.

If you are satiated, you can choose to end your satiation to instead [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) without triggering reactions, as you take a quick, enormous jump before any foe can react to your movement.
