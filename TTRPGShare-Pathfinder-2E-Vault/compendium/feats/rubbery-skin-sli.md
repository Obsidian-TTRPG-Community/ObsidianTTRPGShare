# Rubbery Skin  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Disturbing Defense](disturbing-defense-sli.md)

Your skin develops a malleable, rubbery quality. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 2 + your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype. You also gain resistance equal to twice that amount to extra damage from critical hits; if the resistance is greater than the extra damage, it reduces the extra damage to 0 but doesn't reduce the attack's normal damage.
