# Forensic Acumen  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)

You understand the principles of forensic medicine, making you better at examining a body to determine the cause of death or injury. You can perform a forensic examination on a body, as described under [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) in the [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) skill, in half the normal amount of time it would take (to a minimum of 5 minutes). If you succeed at your check, you can attempt an immediate check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) to follow up on something you found, with a +2 circumstance bonus. This check is usually related to the cause of injury or death, such as a [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) check to identify a poison or weapon that was used or an additional [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) check to identify a specific disease. If you prefer, you can instead attempt to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the type of creature whose body you were examining, using the appropriate skill and gaining the same circumstance bonus.

The circumstance bonus increases to +3 if you have master proficiency in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) and +4 if you have legendary proficiency.
