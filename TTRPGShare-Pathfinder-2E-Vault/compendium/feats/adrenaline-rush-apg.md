# Adrenaline Rush  *Feat 1*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md)  


In the heat of battle, you are capable of amazing feats of strength. While you are [raging](../../rules/actions/rage.md), increase your [encumbered](../../rules/conditions.md#Encumbered) and maximum Bulk limits by 2; you also gain a +1 status bonus to [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) checks to lift heavy objects, [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md), and [Force Open](../../rules/actions/force-open.md).
