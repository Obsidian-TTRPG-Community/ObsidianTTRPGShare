# Familiar Oddities  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Curse Maelstrom Dedication](curse-maelstrom-dedication-da.md), trained in

[Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) or [Curse Lore](../skills.md#Lore) Perhaps due to the curse within you, curses occasionally perceive you as an extension of themselves and readily reveal themselves to you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [Identify Magic](../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md) on a cursed item or a spell that has the [curse](../../rules/traits/curse.md) trait.
