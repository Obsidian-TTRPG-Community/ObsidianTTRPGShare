# Aasimar's Mercy  *Feat 13*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  


Your celestial powers allow you to remove lesser afflictions with ease. Each day, you can cast two 4th-level divine innate spells. You can choose from the following spells each time you cast: [remove curse](../spells/remove-curse.md), [remove disease](../spells/remove-disease.md), and [neutralize poison](../spells/neutralize-poison.md).
