# Favor Of Heaven  *Feat 17*  
[tengu](../../rules/traits/tengu-b1.md)  


You're one of Hei Feng's chosen people and have the authority of the Celestial Court on your side. Once per day, you can cast a 6th-level [spirit blast](../spells/spirit-blast.md) as a divine innate spell. In addition, you gain resistance 5 to both good and evil damage.
