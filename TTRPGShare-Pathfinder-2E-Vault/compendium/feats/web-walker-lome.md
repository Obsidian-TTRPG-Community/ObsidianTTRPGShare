# Web Walker  *Feat 1*  
[anadi](../../rules/traits/anadi-lome.md)  


You have plenty of practice navigating webs. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves and AC against the [web](../spells/web.md) spell, natural webbing, and effects that entrap you in webbing, as well as a +1 circumstance bonus against other effects that snare and entangle you, like the [entangle](../spells/entangle.md) spell. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an effect involving a web, you get a critical success instead.
