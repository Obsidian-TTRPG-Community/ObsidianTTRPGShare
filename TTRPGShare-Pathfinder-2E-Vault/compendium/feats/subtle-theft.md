# Subtle Theft  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery)

When you successfully [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md) something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a –2 circumstance penalty to their [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DCs to detect your theft. Additionally, if you first [Create a Diversion](../../rules/actions/create-a-diversion.md) using [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), taking a single [Palm an Object](../../rules/actions/palm-an-object.md) or [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md) action doesn't end your [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) condition.
