# Craft Anything  *Feat 15*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You can find ways to craft just about anything, despite restrictions. As long as you have the appropriate [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) skill feat (such as [Magical Crafting](magical-crafting.md) for magic items) and meet the item's level and proficiency requirement, you ignore just about any other requirement, such as being of a specific ancestry or providing spells. The only exceptions are requirements that add to the item's cost, including castings of spells that themselves have a cost, and requirements of special items such as the [philosopher's stone](../equipment/items/philosophers-stone.md) that have exclusive means of access and [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting). The GM decides whether you can ignore a requirement.
