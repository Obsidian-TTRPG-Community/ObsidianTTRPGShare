# Warden's Guidance  *Feat 14*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  


You can convey your prey's location to your allies, no matter how well hidden it is. As long as your hunted prey is [observed](../../rules/conditions.md#Observed) by you, all your allies who roll failures and critical failures when [Seeking](../../rules/actions/seek.md) it get a success instead. Your allies need to be able to see or hear you to gain this benefit. You have to be able to call out or use gestures for your allies to get this benefit.
