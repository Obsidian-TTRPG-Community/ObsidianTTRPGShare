# Undying Conviction  *Feat 4*  
[aura](../../rules/traits/aura.md)  [cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [oracle](../../rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [wizard](../../rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: able to create or control undead; cleric with a negative font, oracle of bones, or necromancer wizard

Your presence has a bolstering effect on your undead minions. Undead creatures under your control and within a 30‑foot emanation around you gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws to resist positive damage and to Will saving throws to resist effects that would make them [controlled](../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled).

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
