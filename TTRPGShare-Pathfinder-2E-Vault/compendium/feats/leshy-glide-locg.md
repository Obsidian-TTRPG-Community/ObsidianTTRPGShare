# Leshy Glide  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[leshy](../../rules/traits/leshy-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: leaf leshy heritage or [Cat Fall](cat-fall.md) skill feat
- **Activity** Single Action

Using your own leaves, you can control your descent. You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. As long as you spend at least 1 action gliding each round and have not yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn.
