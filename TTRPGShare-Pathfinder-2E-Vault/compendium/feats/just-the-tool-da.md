[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mind Smith Dedication](mind-smith-dedication-da.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You temporarily change your weapon's shape to assist you in the field. You morph your weapon into a single simple tool, such as a shovel or crowbar, to help with a mundane task. You can't replicate entire tool kits with this ability. You can use this action again to change your mind weapon back to a weapon.
