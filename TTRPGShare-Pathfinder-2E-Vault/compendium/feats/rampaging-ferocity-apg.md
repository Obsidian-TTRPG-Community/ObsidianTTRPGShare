# Rampaging Ferocity  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 17*  
[orc](../../rules/traits/orc.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Orc Ferocity](orc-ferocity.md)
- **Trigger** You use [Orc Ferocity](orc-ferocity.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

You lash out viciously even as you fend off death. Make a single melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) brings a foe to 0 Hit Points, this activation of [Orc Ferocity](orc-ferocity.md) doesn't count against its frequency.
