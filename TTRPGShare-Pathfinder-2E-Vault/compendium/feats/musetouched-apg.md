# Musetouched  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


Your blood sings with the liberating power of the azatas, living embodiments of freedom from the wild realm of Elysium. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md). When you roll a critical failure on a check to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md), you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.

## Musetouched leads to...

[Azata Magic](azata-magic-apg.md), [Call Of Elysium](call-of-elysium-loag.md)
