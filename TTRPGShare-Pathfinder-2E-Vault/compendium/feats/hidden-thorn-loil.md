# Hidden Thorn  *Feat 1*  
[ghoran](../../rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md)  


Some flowers can hide their thorns, and yours happen to be [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) along your arms. You gain a thorns unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage.

Your thorns are in the knife weapon group and have the [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md) and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.
