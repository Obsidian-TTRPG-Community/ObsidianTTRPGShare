# Careful Explorer  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)

You've explored enough dusty tombs and [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) vaults to gain a sixth sense about traps, and you sometimes notice them even when you're not trying to.

Even if you aren't [Searching](../../rules/actions/search.md) in exploration mode, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to [Search](../../rules/actions/search.md) for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.
