# Tinkering Fingers  *Feat 1*  
[ratfolk](../../rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md)  


You're good with your hands and can quickly improvise a fix for [broken](../../rules/conditions.md#Broken) or damaged equipment. You're trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting). If you would automatically become trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can [Repair](../../rules/actions/repair.md) an item without using a repair kit without taking the –2 circumstance penalty, improvising tools from whatever you have at hand.
