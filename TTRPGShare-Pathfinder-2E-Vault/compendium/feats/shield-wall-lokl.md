# Shield Wall  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Trigger** Your shield is raised and an adjacent ally [Raises a Shield](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your shield in tandem with an ally's, forming a barricade. Both you and the triggering creature have standard cover as long as you remain adjacent to each other and you both have your shields raised; when this is no longer the case, the effect ends. You and your ally can't use this cover to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md), as it's obvious you're standing there holding your shields, but you and your ally can use it to [Take Cover](../../rules/actions/take-cover.md).

Normally, if you and your ally don't move, Shield Wall lasts until the beginning of your next turn, when your shield is no longer raised.
