# Shake It Off  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You concentrate on your rage, overcoming fear and fighting back sickness. Reduce your [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition value by 1, and attempt a Fortitude save to recover from the [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition as if you had spent an action retching; you reduce your [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition value by 1 on a failure (but not on a critical failure), by 2 on a success, or by 3 on a critical success.
