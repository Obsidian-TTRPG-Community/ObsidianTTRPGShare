[emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Your blow not only wounds creatures but also shatters their confidence. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and deal damage, the target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit.
