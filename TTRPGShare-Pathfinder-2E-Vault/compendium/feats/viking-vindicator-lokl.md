# Viking Vindicator  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Viking Dedication](viking-dedication-apg.md)

You are one of the raiders eagerly planning to launch an assault by sea on the Whispering Tyrant's Isle of Terror. You gain the Sudden Charge fighter feat, though it's a viking feat for you instead. As normal when gaining an additional feat from an archetype feat, gaining [Sudden Charge](sudden-charge-barbarian.md) doesn't count toward fulfilling the special requirement for [Viking Dedication](viking-dedication-apg.md). If you already had [Sudden Charge](sudden-charge-barbarian.md), you can retrain it as part of gaining this feat. When you use [Sudden Charge](sudden-charge-barbarian.md) to [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) a target in shallow water, the target is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), as you use the water kicked up by your passage to camouflage your angle of attack. If you have [Viking Weapon Familiarity](viking-weapon-familiarity-apg.md) or [Viking Weapon Specialist](viking-weapon-specialist-apg.md), add the [bastard sword](../equipment/items/bastard-sword.md) and [rapier](../equipment/items/rapier.md) to the list of weapons in those feats.
