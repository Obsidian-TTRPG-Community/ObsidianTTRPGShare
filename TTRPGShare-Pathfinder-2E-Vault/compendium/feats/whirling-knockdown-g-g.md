# Whirling Knockdown  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded one-handed firearm and a one-handed melee weapon.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You fire your gun while throwing off a target's balance with your melee weapon. Then, you topple your foe to the ground with the quick orchestrated combination. You don't need to use brute force to do so, or even necessarily to hit with your gunshot; the effect is all about performing perfectly and eliminating your target's movements and options, leaving them no choice but to fall.

Make a ranged firearm [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature within the reach of your melee weapon and then attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check against the creature's Reflex DC. If the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) critically succeeds, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its Reflex DC against this check. The [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check has the following effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target falls and lands [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). It takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage from the fall.
> - **Success** The target falls and lands [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** Your plans backfired on you, and you're forced to drop your melee weapon in your space.
