# Form Of The Fiend  *Feat 1*  
[tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


Part of your body has an obvious, fiendish appearance. Your hands end in razor-sharp claws, you have hooves instead of feet, sharp teeth fill your mouth, or a whipping tail extends from your spine. You gain your choice of one of the following unarmed attacks. The attack is in the brawling group and has the listed damage die and traits.

Claw `1d4` slashing (agile, finesse, unarmed, versatile piercing)

Hoof `1d6` bludgeoning (finesse, unarmed)

Jaws `1d6` piercing (finesse, unarmed)

Tail `1d4` bludgeoning (agile, finesse, unarmed)

**Special.** You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat, nor can you change the type of attack you gained.
