# Eidolon's Opportunity  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[eidolon](../../rules/traits/eidolon-som.md)  [evolution](../../rules/traits/evolution-som.md)  [summoner](../../rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature within your eidolon's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your eidolon makes a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, your eidolon disrupts that action.

This [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
