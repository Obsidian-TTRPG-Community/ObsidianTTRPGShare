# Bullet Dancer Reload  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bullet Dancer Burn](bullet-dancer-burn-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You're in Bullet Dancer Stance
- **Activity** Single Action

You [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a simple firearm, and then [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to reload that same firearm. You don't need a free hand to reload your simple firearm in this way.
