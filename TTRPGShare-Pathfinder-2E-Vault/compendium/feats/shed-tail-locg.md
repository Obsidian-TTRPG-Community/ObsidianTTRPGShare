# Shed Tail  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[lizardfolk](../../rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Tail Whip](tail-whip-locg.md)
- **Trigger** You become [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).
- **Requirements**: You have a fully grown tail.
- **Activity** Reaction

You can shed your tail to escape. You cease being [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), then [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) without triggering any reactions from the creature that [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) you. It takes 1 week for your tail to fully grow back. Until it does, you can't use your tail unarmed attack, and you take a –2 circumstance penalty on checks to [Balance](../../rules/actions/balance.md).
