It has the [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md) trait and a magical tradition trait depending on its type.

The warmask is unique to you and might signify your hold, your accomplishments, or your faith. While creating your mask, you must choose the source of your warmask's power from the options below.

You can spend 1 hour performing a ceremony that costs 50 gp to attune yourself more deeply with your warmask. If you do, you gain a +1 item bonus to the associated skill whenever you wear the warmask.
