# Arcane Communication  *Feat 1*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  


You can deliver silent messages. You gain touch telepathy, allowing you to communicate silently and mentally with any creature you're touching, as long as you share a language.

**Enhancement** You can send your messages even further. Your telepathy gains a range of 10 feet, but you still have to share a language with your target.
