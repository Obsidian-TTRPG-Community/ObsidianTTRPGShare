# Incredible Ricochet  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](../../rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Incredible Aim](incredible-aim.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

After your first shot singles out your opponent's position, you direct another that ricochets around obstacles and strikes unerringly. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature you previously attacked this turn. You ignore the target's [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition and all cover.
