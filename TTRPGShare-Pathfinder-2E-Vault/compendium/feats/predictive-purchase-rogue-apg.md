# Predictive Purchase (Rogue)  *Feat 8*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  


You somehow manage to have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md) and [Prescient Consumable](prescient-consumable-apg.md) feats. When using [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md), you can draw the item from your backpack (or a similar container) as a 2-action activity, instead of taking 1 minute to do so.
