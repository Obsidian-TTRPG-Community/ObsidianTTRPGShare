# Iron Repercussions  *Feat 1*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tyrant cause

Disobeying your [Iron Command](../../rules/actions/iron-command-apg.md) has lasting consequences.

If an enemy refuses to kneel to you, you can deal [persistent mental damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) instead of normal mental damage. You must decide whether the mental damage will be persistent before your enemy chooses whether to kneel or not. The amount of damage is unchanged.
