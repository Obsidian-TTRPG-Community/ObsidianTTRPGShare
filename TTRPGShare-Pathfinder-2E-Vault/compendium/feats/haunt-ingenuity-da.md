# Haunt Ingenuity  *Feat 1*  
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [thaumaturge](../../rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  


Your cunning knowledge grants you the ability to notice the emotional echo of a soul that passed on, leaving a haunt in its wake. Even when you aren't [Searching](../../rules/actions/search.md) while in exploration mode, the GM rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts that usually require you to be [Searching](../../rules/actions/search.md).

You can disable haunts that require master proficiency in a skill as long as you're at least trained in the skill. If you have master proficiency in the skill, you can disable haunts that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead.
