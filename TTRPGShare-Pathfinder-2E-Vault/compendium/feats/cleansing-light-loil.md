# Cleansing Light  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [kashrishi](../../rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md)  [light](../../rules/traits/light.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

A burst of light from your horn cleanses your allies of ailments and sends your foes reeling. You and all allies in a 20-foot emanation benefit from a 4th-level [restoration](../spells/restoration.md) spell. All enemies within the emanation are [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of your next turn.
