# Watch And Learn  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Trigger** An ally you can see succeeds or critically succeeds at a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, using a skill in which you are untrained.
- **Activity** Reaction

Pathfinder agents serve as members of diverse teams with complementary skill sets. You are practiced at following the example of a more skilled ally to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. For the next minute you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to the [observed](../../rules/conditions.md#Observed) skill check, even though you are untrained. This does not allow you to attempt trained actions using that skill unless you would otherwise be able to do so.
