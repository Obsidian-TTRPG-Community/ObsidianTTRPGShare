[catfolk](../../rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md)  [flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You vanish with silent treads. You [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md), then [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md). You still need to meet the requirements to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md), as normal.
