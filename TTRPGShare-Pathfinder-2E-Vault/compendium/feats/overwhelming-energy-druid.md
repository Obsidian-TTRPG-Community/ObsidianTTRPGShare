# Overwhelming Energy (Druid)  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

With a complex gesture, you call upon the primal power of your spell to overcome enemies' resistances. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), the spell ignores an amount of the target's resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the wall created by [wall of fire](../spells/wall-of-fire.md). A creature's immunities are unaffected.
