# Perfect Distraction  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)
- **Activity** Single Action

You use clever tactics to mislead your foes as you sneak away. You [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) while leaving a decoy behind. The decoy acts as the spell [mislead](../spells/mislead.md), though you aren't [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible), just [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected). You can continue to concentrate to move your decoy, as with the spell, whether or not you remain [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) throughout the duration. Once you use Perfect Distraction, you need to spend 10 minutes to set up another decoy before you can use it again.
