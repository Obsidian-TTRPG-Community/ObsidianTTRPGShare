# Ganzi Gaze  *Feat 1*  
[ganzi](../../rules/traits/ganzi-loag.md)  


You have unusual sensory abilities passed down from your chaotic forebears. You gain [low-light vision](../../rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md). If you already have [low-light vision](../../rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md), you gain [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) instead.

**Special.** You can select this feat a second time to gain [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) in addition to [low-light vision](../../rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md).
