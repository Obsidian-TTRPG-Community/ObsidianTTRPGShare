# Repeating Hand Crossbow Training  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Drow Shootist Dedication](drow-shootist-dedication-av3.md)

You become trained in the [repeating hand crossbow](../equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md) and gain access to [repeating hand crossbows](../equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md) and [shootist bandoliers](../equipment/items/shootist-bandolier-av3.md). Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the repeating hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a [repeating hand crossbow](../equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md) you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can perform the Shootist's Draw action with [repeating hand crossbows](../equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md).

**Special.** If you have the [Running Reload](running-reload.md) feat, you can reload a repeating hand crossbow magazine on the move. You can use [Running Reload](running-reload.md) as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after you [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md), or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md), or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a shootist bandolier.
