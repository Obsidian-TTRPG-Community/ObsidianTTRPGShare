# Vicious Venom  *Feat 17*  
[vishkanya](../../rules/traits/vishkanya-loil.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Envenom](../../rules/actions/envenom-loil.md)

The venom you produce is exceptionally potent and difficult to overcome. Your vishkanyan venom gains the [virulent](../../rules/traits/virulent.md) trait, requiring two consecutive saves to reduce the venom's stage by 1. A critical success reduces your venom's stage by only 1 instead of by 2.
