# Vandal  *Feat 5*  
[goblin](../../rules/traits/goblin.md)  


You have a knack for breaking and dismantling things. Putting them back together is the boring part, so you largely don't bother with that. You become trained in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery). If you would automatically become trained in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, whenever you hit with a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a trap or an unattended object, you ignore the first 5 points of the object's Hardness.
