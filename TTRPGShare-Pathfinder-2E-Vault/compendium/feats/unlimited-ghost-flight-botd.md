# Unlimited Ghost Flight  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Flight](ghost-flight-botd.md)

You put your connection to the material world farther behind you. Your fly Speed no longer restricts the height you can fly. When you use Ghost Flight, instead of its normal effect, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed for 10 minutes.
