# Desperate Finisher  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Trigger** You complete the last action on your turn, and your turn has not ended yet.
- **Requirements**: You meet the requirements to use an action with the [press](../../rules/traits/press.md) trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

You throw everything into one last press. Use a single action that you know with the [press](../../rules/traits/press.md) trait as part of Desperate Finisher. You forgo the ability to use reactions until the start of your next turn.
