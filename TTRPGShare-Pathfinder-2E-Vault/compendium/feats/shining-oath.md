# Shining Oath  *Feat 2*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [oath](../../rules/traits/oath.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

You've sworn an oath to put the undead to rest. Add the following tenet to your champion's code after the other tenets: "You must end the existence of undead you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the unlikely event you find a good undead, you can try to work out a more peaceful way to help it recover from its undead state rather than destroying it in combat, such as helping it complete its unfinished business and find peace."

Your [Retributive Strike](../../rules/actions/retributive-strike.md) gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against an undead, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used. Your [Glimpse of Redemption](../../rules/actions/glimpse-of-redemption.md)'s resistance against damage from an undead is 7 + your level. If you use [Liberating Step](../../rules/actions/liberating-step.md) triggered by an undead, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your [Liberating Step](../../rules/actions/liberating-step.md), and the ally can [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) twice afterward.

You don't consider undead to be legitimate authorities, even in nations ruled by undead.
