# Courageous Opportunity  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: warrior muse
- **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses an [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) effect, [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) action, or [move](../../rules/traits/move.md) action; makes a ranged attack; or leaves a square during its [move](../../rules/traits/move.md) action.
- **Requirements**: You are affected by [inspire courage](../spells/inspire-courage.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You bellow a ferocious call to arms, inspiring yourself to lash out at a foe. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) action, the action is disrupted.
