You constantly remember details about the world. You attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). If you succeed, you gain additional information or context. If you critically succeed, at the GM's discretion you might gain even more additional information or context than normal.

Shisk Enclaves Most shisks can be found in small communities burrowed into the Barrier Wall, existing in caverns and tunnels that riddle the mountains from peak to base. A few scattered enclaves can be found in the Bandu Hills—the dry and arid region well-suited to shisk tastes.

Occasionally, shisk societies burrow deeply enough that they reside within the Mwangi Darklands, while other brave families or individuals seek out the academic haven of Nantambu, hoping to accelerate their education.

Shisks are almost completely unknown outside of the Mwangi Expanse. A few can be found on the Thuvian side of the Barrier Wall, and at least one shisk is believed to have approached the Citadel of the Alchemist to be accepted as a student.

One small and bold enclave is rumored to reside in the Shattered Range near the nation of Nex, hoping to glean secrets from the many powerful wizards who live there.

Other Peoples.
