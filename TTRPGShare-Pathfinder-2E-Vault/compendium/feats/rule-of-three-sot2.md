# Rule Of Three  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Folklorist Dedication](folklorist-dedication-sot2.md)
- **Trigger** The villain of the tale you've spun makes an attack roll with a given weapon or unarmed attack, uses a particular special ability (such as a Breath Weapon), or
- **Requirements**: You have Spun a Tale.
- **Activity** Reaction

Casts a Spell against the hero, and they used that same attack, special ability, or spell against the hero on the previous turn.

Heroes learn from their previous failures, often succeeding on the third attempt. You narrate a tale of the hero's success, granting them a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC or saving throw against the triggering effect. If the villain has used the same effect against the hero on both of their last two turns, and you used Rule of Three on that effect last turn as well, the bonus increases to +4.
