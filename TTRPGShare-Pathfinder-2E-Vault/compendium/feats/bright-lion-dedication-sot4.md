# Bright Lion Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Bright Lion background (Lost Omens World Guide 95) You become trained in [Mzali Lore](../skills.md#Lore) and your choice of
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Bright Lions, not a worshipper of [Walkena](../setting/deities/walkena-logm.md), trained in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)

[Deception](../skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of [Walkena](../setting/deities/walkena-logm.md) in your daily life to avoid suspicion.

You typically don't need to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) or [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) to pass yourself off as a worshipper of [Walkena](../setting/deities/walkena-logm.md). Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to [Walkena](../setting/deities/walkena-logm.md).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.
