# Agile Shield Grip  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a shield with a [shield boss](../equipment/items/shield-boss.md) or [shield spikes](../equipment/items/shield-spikes.md) in one hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You change your grip on the shield, allowing you to combine rapid attacks with your [shield boss](../equipment/items/shield-boss.md) or [shield spikes](../equipment/items/shield-spikes.md) and your main weapon's [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) in a series of swift motions. You reduce your [shield boss](../equipment/items/shield-boss.md) and [shield spikes](../equipment/items/shield-spikes.md) weapon damage die to `1d4`. As long as the weapon damage die is `1d4`, your [shield boss](../equipment/items/shield-boss.md) and shield spike [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) gain the agile weapon trait. You can use Agile Shield Grip again to switch to a normal grip, returning the damage to the usual amount and removing the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) trait.
