# Cauterize  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  [gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm and you or an adjacent ally are taking [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
- **Activity** Single Action

You use the smoking barrel of your firearm to sear shut a bleeding wound. Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your firearm. You then press the heated barrel to the wounds of you or an ally within reach that is taking [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), giving an immediate flat check to end the bleed with the lower DC for particularly effective assistance (Core Rulebook 62).
