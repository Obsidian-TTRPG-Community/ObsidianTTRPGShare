# Fire Savvy  *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

You've grown up around a forge and are well-suited to dealing with smoke and flame. Your flat check to remove [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which is reduced to DC 5 with appropriate assistance. In addition, if you roll a success on a saving throw against suffocation or choking due to smoke or ash, you get a critical success instead.
