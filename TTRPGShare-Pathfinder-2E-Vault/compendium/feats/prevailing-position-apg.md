# Prevailing Position  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: at least one stance feat
- **Trigger** You are targeted by an attack or attempt a Reflex saving throw against a damaging effect, and you are in a stance.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your willingness to flow from one stance to another lets you sacrifice their benefits to better protect yourself. You leave the stance you were in, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw or to your AC against the triggering attack.
