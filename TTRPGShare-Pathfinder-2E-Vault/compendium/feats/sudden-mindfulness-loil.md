# Sudden Mindfulness  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[vanara](../../rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  

- **Trigger** You roll a success on a saving throw against an effect that would make you [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) or [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled).
- **Activity** Reaction

Your mind retains full awareness despite the best attempts of others, and your focus throws others off-balance. You get a critical success on the triggering saving throw, and if the triggering effect was caused by a creature, that creature is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you until the end of your next turn.
