# Warding Light  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bright Lion Dedication](bright-lion-dedication-lol.md)

You gain a tattoo that serves as a special ward to defend you against Walkena's forces.

The tattoo allows you to cast the [light](../spells/light.md) cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. If you die, the tattoo immediately casts gentle repose on your corpse, heightened to the same spell level.
