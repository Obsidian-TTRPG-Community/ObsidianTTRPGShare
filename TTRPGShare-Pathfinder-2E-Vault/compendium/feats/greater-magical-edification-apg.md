# Greater Magical Edification  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magical Edification](magical-edification-apg.md)

You've continued to expand your compendium of tools to compile knowledge. You can cast [comprehend language](../spells/comprehend-language.md), [mindlink](../spells/mindlink.md), and [secret page](../spells/secret-page.md) as innate occult spells, each once per day. When you cast [secret page](../spells/secret-page.md), it is automatically heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from [Magical Edification](magical-edification-apg.md).
