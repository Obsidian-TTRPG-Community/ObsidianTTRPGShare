# Sudden Charge (Barbarian)  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  [open](../../rules/traits/open.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while [Burrowing](../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
