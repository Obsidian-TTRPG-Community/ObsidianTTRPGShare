# Legs Of Stone  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golem Grafter Dedication](golem-grafter-dedication-ec3.md)

You gain a +2 status bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) or [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) you. You can [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) creatures even if you don't have a hand free. When you successfully [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) a foe, you can [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) away from your opponent (instead of toward it), but you must move the same distance in the opposite direction from where you Shoved it.
