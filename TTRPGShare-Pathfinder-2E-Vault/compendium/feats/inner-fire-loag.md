# Inner Fire  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](../../rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md)  


You can call the fire inside you into the palm of your hand. You can cast the [produce flame](../spells/produce-flame.md) cantrip as an innate primal or arcane spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
