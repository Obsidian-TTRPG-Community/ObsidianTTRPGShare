# Uncanny Bombs  *Feat 12*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Far Lobber](far-lobber.md)

You lob bombs unerringly, despite obstructions or distance. When you throw an alchemical item with the [bomb](../../rules/traits/bomb.md) trait, its range increment increases to 60 feet, you reduce any circumstance bonus to the target's AC from cover by 1, and you automatically succeed at the flat check when targeting a [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) creature.
