# Defensive Armaments  *Feat 2*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  


You use bulky firearms or crossbows to shield your body from your foes' attacks. Any two-handed firearms and two-handed crossbows you wield gain the [parry](../../rules/traits/parry.md) trait. If an appropriate weapon already has the [parry](../../rules/traits/parry.md) trait, increase the circumstance bonus to AC it grants when used to parry from +1 to +2.
