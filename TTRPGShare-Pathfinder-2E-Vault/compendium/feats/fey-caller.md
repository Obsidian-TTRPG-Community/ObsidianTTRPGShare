# Fey Caller  *Feat 8*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  


You have learned some of the tricks the fey use to bend primal magic toward illusions and trickery. Add [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md), [illusory object](../spells/illusory-object.md), [illusory scene](../spells/illusory-scene.md), and [veil](../spells/veil.md) to your spell list as primal spells.
