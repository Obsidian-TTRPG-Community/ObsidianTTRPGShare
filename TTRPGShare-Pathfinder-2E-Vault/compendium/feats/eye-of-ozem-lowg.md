[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md), expert in [Perception](../skills.md#Perception)

You've learned how to spot danger at a distance, allowing you to serve as a sentry with ease. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls when using [Perception](../skills.md#Perception), and when you're Scouting, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus instead of +1.
