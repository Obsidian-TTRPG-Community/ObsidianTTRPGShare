# Medical Researcher  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)

Kassi has taught you not only how to apply medicines with your medical skills but how to craft them as well. When you [Craft](../../rules/actions/craft.md) healer's kits, vaccines, addiction suppressants, antidotes, antiplagues, elixirs of life, or other non-magical medical or healing items, you can use [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) instead of [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting).
