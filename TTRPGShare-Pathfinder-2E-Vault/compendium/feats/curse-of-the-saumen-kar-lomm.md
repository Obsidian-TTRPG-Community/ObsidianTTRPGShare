# Curse of the Saumen Kar  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Frostbite Runes](frostbite-runes-lomm.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You activate the runes on your body to create an icy prison around a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet. The prison is a sphere made of unmelting ice, just large enough to fit your target. The target, and any creatures sharing its space, must attempt a Reflex save, with a DC using the higher of your class DC and spell DC. A creature that fails becomes trapped inside the prison. If it succeeds, the creature is pushed outside the prison into a space of its choice. If the target shares its space with a gargantuan creature, the effect fails.

The dome has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points; it's immune to cold, critical hits, and precision damage. The prison lasts until destroyed, until you use this ability to create a new prison, or until you die.
