# Shaped Contaminant  *Feat 12*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


Through a combination of careful manipulation and precise breath control, you can deploy inhaled toxins precisely.

When you activate an inhaled poison, you can cause it to fill a 20-foot line that's 5 feet tall rather than a 10-foot cube. You gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws against inhaled poisons that you activate.
