# Bless Tonic  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [positive](../../rules/traits/positive.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), deity who grants heal divine font

You channel positive energy into restoratives that ward against harm. When you [Craft](../../rules/actions/craft.md) an alchemical item that restores Hit Points (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, [Quick Alchemy](../../rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md), or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical item and gains the [positive](../../rules/traits/positive.md) trait. For example, an elixir of life would become a blessed elixir of life. When a creature regains Hit Points using a blessed alchemical item, the overflowing energy grants them negative resistance 5 for 1 round, or negative resistance 10 if you are legendary in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting).
