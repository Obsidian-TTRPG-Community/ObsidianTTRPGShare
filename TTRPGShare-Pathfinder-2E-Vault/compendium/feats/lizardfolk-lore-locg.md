# Lizardfolk Lore  *Feat 1*  
[lizardfolk](../../rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  


You listened carefully to the tales passed down among your community. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) and [Survival](../skills.md#Survival). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Iruxi Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
