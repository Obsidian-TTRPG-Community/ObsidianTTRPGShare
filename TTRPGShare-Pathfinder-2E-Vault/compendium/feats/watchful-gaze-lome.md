# Watchful Gaze  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [goloma](../../rules/traits/goloma-lome.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You use your many eyes to look in all directions at once, making you extremely observant for a short period of time. You gain [all-around vision](../../rules/abilities/all-around-vision.md) until the start of your next turn. This lets you see in all directions and prevents you from being flanked.

## Watchful Gaze leads to...

[Constant Gaze](constant-gaze-lome.md)
