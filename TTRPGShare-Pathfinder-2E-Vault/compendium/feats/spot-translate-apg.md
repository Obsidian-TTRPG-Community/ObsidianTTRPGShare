# Spot Translate  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](linguist-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** Another creature within 60 feet uses a [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md) effect in a language you understand.
- **Activity** Reaction

You interpret a creature's words, repeating their message in a different language that you know. If the triggering effect's targets speak either the original language or the one you translated into, they are affected.
