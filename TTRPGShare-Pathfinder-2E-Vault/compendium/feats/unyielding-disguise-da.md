# Unyielding Disguise  *Feat 9*  
[reflection](../../rules/traits/reflection-da.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to cast [humanoid form](../spells/humanoid-form.md) or [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md)

When you cast [humanoid form](../spells/humanoid-form.md) or [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md) to alter your appearance, the spell's duration is 2 hours. At the end of the duration, you can extend the spell's duration for another hour, but doing so is taxing, making you [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained). You can keep extending it in this way, increasing your [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition by 1 each time, to a maximum duration of 6 hours.
