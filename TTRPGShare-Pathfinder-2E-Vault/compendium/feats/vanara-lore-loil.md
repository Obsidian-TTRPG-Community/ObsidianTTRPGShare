# Vanara Lore  *Feat 1*  
[vanara](../../rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  


You attained the cultural training of a ba-sadhak, a seeker of treasures and rare delights. You become trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) and [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You're also trained in the [Vanara Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill.
