# Investigate Haunting  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Hunter Dedication](ghost-hunter-dedication-av1.md)

You are skilled at noticing the telltale signs of ghosts and hauntings. Even when you aren't Investigating in exploration mode, you get a check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about incorporeal undead and haunts active in the area. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to disable haunts.
