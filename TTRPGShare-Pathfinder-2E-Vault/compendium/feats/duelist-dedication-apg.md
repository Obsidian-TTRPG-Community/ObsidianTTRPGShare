# Duelist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in light armor and simple weapons

You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel, no matter the circumstances. You gain the [Quick Draw](quick-draw-ranger.md) ranger feat, enabling you to both draw and attack with a weapon as 1 action. This serves as Quick Draw for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the duelist archetype.

## Duelist Dedication leads to...

[Duelist's Challenge](duelists-challenge-apg.md), [Selfless Parry](selfless-parry-apg.md), [Student Of The Dueling Arts](student-of-the-dueling-arts-apg.md)
