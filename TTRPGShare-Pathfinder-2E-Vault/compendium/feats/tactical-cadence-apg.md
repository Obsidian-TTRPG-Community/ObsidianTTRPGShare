# Tactical Cadence  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cadence Call](cadence-call-apg.md)

Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively. When you grant allies the [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition using Cadence Call, they can use the extra action to either [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), and they aren't [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) on their following turn if they use the extra action.
