# Runtsage  *Feat 5*  
[hobgoblin](../../rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md)  


Unlike most of your kind, who dismiss goblins as embarrassments or expendable annoyances, you have studied the methodology behind their irresponsible and incomprehensible actions. You gain the [Adopted Ancestry](adopted-ancestry.md) general feat and must select goblin as the feat's chosen ancestry. You also gain one 1st-level goblin ancestry feat.
