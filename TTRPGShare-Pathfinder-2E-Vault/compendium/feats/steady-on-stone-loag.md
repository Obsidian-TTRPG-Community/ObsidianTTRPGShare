# Steady On Stone  *Feat 1*  
[oread](../../rules/traits/oread-b2.md)  


Your connection to the earth makes natural uneven surfaces less of a hindrance for you. You can ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble and uneven ground made of stone and earth. In addition, when you use the [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) skill to [Balance](../../rules/actions/balance.md) on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone and earth, you aren't [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed), and when you roll a success at one of these [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks, you get a critical success instead.
