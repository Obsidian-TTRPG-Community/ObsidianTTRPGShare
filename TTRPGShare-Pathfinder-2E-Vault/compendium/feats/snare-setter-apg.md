# Snare Setter  *Feat 1*  
[kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You are adept at the time-honored kobold art of trap making. You gain the trained proficiency in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting). If you were already trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain access to all uncommon kobold snares. You gain the [Snare Crafting](snare-crafting.md) feat, though when choosing your formulas for that feat, you can also choose from uncommon kobold snares, as well as common snares.
