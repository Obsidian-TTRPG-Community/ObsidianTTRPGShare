# Shore Step  *Feat 1*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: wave order

The shallows and tide pools have always called to you and let you pass unhindered. You ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water. In addition, if you roll a success on an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](../../rules/actions/balance.md) on a slippery or wet surface, or on an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md), you get a critical success instead.
