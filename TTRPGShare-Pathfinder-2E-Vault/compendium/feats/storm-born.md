# Storm Born  *Feat 1*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Storm order

You are at home out in the elements, reveling in the power of nature unleashed. You do not take circumstance penalties to ranged spell attacks or [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks caused by weather, and your targeted spells don't require a flat check to succeed against a target [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) by weather (such as fog).
