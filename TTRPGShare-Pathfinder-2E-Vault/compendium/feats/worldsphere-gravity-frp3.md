# Worldsphere Gravity  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 20*  
[metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [wizard](../../rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Single Action

Though creating demiplanes usually requires lengthy rituals, you know how to establish minor planar effects in imitation of Syndara's masterpieces. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of at least 5th level from your spell slots that affects an area, you can apply one of the following planar effects to a 20-foot burst centered within the spell's area.

The effect persists for 1 minute.

- **Gravitational Morass** The pull of gravity is amplified here, creating greater difficult terrain. Flying creatures that pass through the area must succeed at a Reflex save against your spell DC or fall to the ground, taking bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen.
- **Flowing Time** Erratic timestreams aid you within this space. A creature that starts its turn in the burst is affected by haste on that turn.
