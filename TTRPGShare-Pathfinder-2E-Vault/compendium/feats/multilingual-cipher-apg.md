# Multilingual Cipher  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](linguist-dedication-apg.md), expert in [Society](../skills.md#Society)

You use multiple languages to create and break codes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Decipher Writing](../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md). If another creature attempts to [Decipher Writing](../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md) you encoded, they take a –2 circumstance penalty unless they speak all the languages you used when you created the writing.
