# Spiritual Explorer  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)

You're familiar with the danger that lingering spirits can pose to an unwary adventurer, and you're particularly attuned to their presence. Even if you aren't [Searching](../../rules/actions/search.md) in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find haunts that normally require you to [Search](../../rules/actions/search.md) for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular haunt.
