# Spell Devourer  *Feat 13*  
[orc](../../rules/traits/orc.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pervasive Superstition](pervasive-superstition.md)

You don't just resist magic; you devour it. Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md) effect, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double the spell's level, or equal to the level if the [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md) effect isn't a spell. These temporary Hit Points last until the end of your next turn.
