# Fey Ascension  *Feat 9*  
[rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fey Influence](fey-influence-loil.md)

The fey influence on your form and features grows even more powerful and notable.

You gain one of the following features and abilities; this must be the same animal or fey type as you chose for [Fey Influence](fey-influence-loil.md).

- **Anteater** You become an expert in primal DCs and spell attack rolls. You can cast [slow](../spells/slow.md) as an innate primal spell once per day.
- **Cat** Sith You laugh off the outraged curses of those you have tricked or wronged. Whenever a creature targets you with a [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect, make a DC 13 flat check. On a success, you are unaffected.
- **Cursed** Bluebird You have enough control over your curse to turn a bane into a minor blessing. Once per day, you can temporarily transform yourself or an ally into a blue bird, as a 4th-level [pest form](../spells/pest-form.md) (bird only) targeting one willing creature.
- **Dryad** Your hair becomes intermixed with delicate but razor-edged leaves that move as you command. You gain a leaves ranged unarmed attack that deals `1d6` slashing damage. Your leaves are in the dart weapon group and have the [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md) and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.
- **Faun** You can cast [charm](../spells/charm.md), sleep, and triple time as innate primal spells once per day each. Whenever you cast one of these spells, you can [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) or [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) as part of the activity.
- **Gremlin** You become an expert in primal DCs and spell attack rolls. You can cast [mad monkeys](../spells/mad-monkeys-apg.md) (Advanced Player's Guide 222) as an innate primal spell once per day.
- **Monarch** Once per day, you gain the ability to manifest a pair of exquisite butterfly wings. These wings remain for 10 minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed while you've manifested your wings.
- **Unicorn** You become trained in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine), or an expert if you were already trained. You gain a +2 status bonus to saves against [poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md) and [charm](../../rules/traits/charm-b1.md) effects.

**Special.** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
