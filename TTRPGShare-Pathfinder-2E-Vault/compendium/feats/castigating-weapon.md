# Castigating Weapon  *Feat 10*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Holy Castigation](holy-castigation.md)

The force of your deity's castigation strengthens your body so you can strike down the wicked. After you damage a fiend using a [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell, your weapon or unarmed [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deal extra good damage to fiends equal to half the level of the [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell until the end of your next turn. This is cumulative with any good damage the weapon already deals (such as from a holy rune).
