# Golden Body  *Feat 20*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You perfect your body, refining the flex of every muscle and the bend of every joint to maximum efficiency. Your unarmed [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) gain the [deadly <d12>](../../rules/traits/deadly.md) trait, and you have fast healing 20, causing you to regain 20 HP at the start of each of your turns provided you have at least 1 HP.
