# Crystalline Dust  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[aphorite](../../rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've learned to disperse the crystalline motes coating your body as a haze. You become [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed), though you can't use this concealment to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md), as normal for concealment where your position is still obvious. The motes stay within an inch of your skin, move with you, and last for a number of rounds equal to half your level.

## Crystalline Dust leads to...

[Ancillary Motes](ancillary-motes-loag.md), [Crystalline Cloud](crystalline-cloud-loag.md)
