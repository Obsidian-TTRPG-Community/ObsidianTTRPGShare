# Restoring Blood  *Feat 5*  
[vishkanya](../../rules/traits/vishkanya-loil.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Envenom](../../rules/actions/envenom-loil.md)

Your body can process an alternative to your venom that heals wounds. You can use your [Envenom](../../rules/actions/envenom-loil.md) action to produce a blood restorative instead of vishkanyan venom. You can make a blood restorative at most once per 10 minutes, even if your [Envenom](../../rules/actions/envenom-loil.md) action can be used more frequently. You or an adjacent creature can [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to consume the restorative to regain `3d6` Hit Points. This is a positive [healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md) effect. A restorative spoils at the start of your next turn. When you reach 15th level, the restorative restores `5d6` Hit Points instead.
