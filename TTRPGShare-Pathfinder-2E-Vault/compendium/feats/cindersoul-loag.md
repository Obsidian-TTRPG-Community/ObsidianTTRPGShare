# Cindersoul  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](../../rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


The fire of your elemental ancestor manifests like [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) embers of a blaze, and your inner charcoal helps staunch bleeding, purify simple poisons, and absorb acid. The DC for you to recover from [persistent acid](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), bleed, and poison damage is 10 instead of 15 (or 5 if you have particularly effective assistance).
