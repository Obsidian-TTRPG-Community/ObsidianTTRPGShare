# Swift Banishment  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Trigger** You critically hit a creature that is not on its home plane.
- **Requirements**: You have a [banishment](../spells/banishment.md) spell prepared.
- **Activity** Reaction

The force of your blow sends your victim back to its home plane. You expend a [banishment](../spells/banishment.md) spell you have prepared, affecting the creature you critically hit without needing to cast the spell. The creature can attempt to resist the spell as normal.
