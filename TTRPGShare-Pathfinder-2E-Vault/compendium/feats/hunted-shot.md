# Hunted Shot  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  [ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon with [reload 0](../../rules/traits/reload.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You take two quick shots against the one you hunt. Make two [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against your prey with the required weapon. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to each [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) normally.
