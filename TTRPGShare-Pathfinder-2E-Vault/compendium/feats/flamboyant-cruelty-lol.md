# Flamboyant Cruelty  *Feat 8*  
[rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  


You love to kick your enemies when they're down, and you look fabulous when you do.

When you make a melee weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe that has at least two of the following conditions, you gain a circumstance bonus to your damage roll equal to the number of these conditions the foe has. The qualifying conditions are [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained), [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), and [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied). If you hit such a foe, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks to [Tumble Through](../../rules/actions/tumble-through.md) and to perform your style's panache-granting actions until the end of your turn.
