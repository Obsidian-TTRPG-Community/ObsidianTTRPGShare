# Black Powder Boost  [V](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies") *Feat 4*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm.
- **Activity** Varies ([>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") OR [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action"))

You fire your weapon as you jump, using the kickback to go farther. You [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) and discharge your firearm to add a +10-foot status bonus to the distance traveled. If you spend 2 actions for Black Powder Boost, you [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) instead.

**Special.** An ability that allows you to [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) as a single action (like the [Quick Jump](quick-jump.md) skill feat) lets you use Black Powder Boost as a single action for those jumps as well.

## Black Powder Boost leads to...

[Black Powder Blaze](black-powder-blaze-g-g.md), [Reach For The Stars](reach-for-the-stars-g-g.md)
