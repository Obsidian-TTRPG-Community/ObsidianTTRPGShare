# Gang Up  *Feat 6*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  


You and your allies harry an opponent in concert. Any enemy is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your melee attacks due to flanking as long as the enemy is within both your reach and your ally's. Your allies must still flank an enemy for it to be [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to them.
