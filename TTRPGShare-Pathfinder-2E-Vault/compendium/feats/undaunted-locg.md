# Undaunted  *Feat 1*  
[leshy](../../rules/traits/leshy-b1.md)  


Your spirit has endured many challenges over its long existence, and you are certain you can overcome whatever hardships life throws your way. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.
