# Gruesome Strike  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil, champion's reaction that grants extra damage with your [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md)
- **Requirements**: Your [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) currently deal extra damage from your champion's reaction.
- **Activity** Single Action

Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the creature that triggered your champion's reaction. If you hit, the target takes double the extra damage from your reaction and must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained).

Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune to your Gruesome Strike for 24 hours.
