# Perfect Shot  [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*  
[flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  [ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a loaded ranged weapon with [reload 1](../../rules/traits/reload.md) or more, and you have not reloaded your weapon since your last turn.
- **Activity** Three-Action

After watching the motions of combat with incredible intensity and precision, you fire at your prey at the perfect moment to deliver maximum pain. Make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon against your hunted prey. If you hit, the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deals maximum damage. After the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), your turn ends.
