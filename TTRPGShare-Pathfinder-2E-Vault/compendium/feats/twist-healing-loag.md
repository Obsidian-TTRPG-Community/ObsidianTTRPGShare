# Twist Healing  *Feat 17*  
[dhampir](../../rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to cast [heal](../spells/heal.md) and [harm](../spells/harm.md)

Your connection to both life and undeath lets you twist the healing power of magic items to suit your own needs and aims. Whenever you [Activate an Item](../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) to cast a [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell, you can invert its energy to produce the effects of an equivalent [harm](../spells/harm.md) spell instead.
