# Ranged Disarm  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bullet Dancer Dedication](bullet-dancer-dedication-g-g.md),
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a simple firearm.
- **Activity** Single Action

When using a simple firearm, you can shoot objects right out of your enemy's hands. Attempt to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) the target using a ranged attack roll with your simple firearm, instead of attempting an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check against the target's Reflex DC.
