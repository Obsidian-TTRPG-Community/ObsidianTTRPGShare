# Synergistic Spell  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 20*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate](halcyon-spellcasting-initiate-locg.md), [Fulminating Synergy](fulminating-synergy-locg.md), legendary in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) and [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)
- **Activity** Single Action

You combine your synergy and spells into a fantastic web of magic, allowing you to cast two spells at once. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from one of your halcyon spell slots, after that spell resolves, you can [Cast another Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) as a free action. This spell must be cast from one of your halcyon spell slots and be a spell that would normally take two actions to cast.
