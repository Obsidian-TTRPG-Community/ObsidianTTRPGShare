# Replenishment Of War  *Feat 10*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in your deity's favored weapon

Striking out against your enemies draws praise and protection from your deity. When you damage a creature with a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) using your deity's favored weapon, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level, or equal to your level if the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit. These temporary Hit Points last until the start of your next turn.
