# Ragdya's Revelry  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[vanara](../../rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** An adjacent creature you can see fails an attack roll against you.
- **Activity** Reaction

You dart away from your foe's attack with a casual laugh, using the opening to cause mischief. You attempt to [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md) an item from the triggering creature, ignoring the usual restriction that the creature can't be in combat.
