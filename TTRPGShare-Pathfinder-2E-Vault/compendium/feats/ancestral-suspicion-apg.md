# Ancestral Suspicion  *Feat 5*  
[elf](../../rules/traits/elf.md)  


Long-lived elves have seen civilizations rise and fall, often at the hands of outside forces. As a result, they have developed a wariness of others who might seek to influence or control them. You've been trained to resist such manipulation, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that would make you [controlled](../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled), such as [dominate](../spells/dominate.md), and to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Sense Motive](../../rules/actions/sense-motive.md) when trying to determine if a creature is under the influence of such an effect. When you roll a success on a saving throw against such an effect, you get a critical success instead.
