# Terrain Master  *Feat 8*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival), [Favored Terrain](favored-terrain.md)

You adapt to your surroundings in any natural terrain. You can spend 1 hour practicing in your current terrain in order to make it your favored terrain, replacing your current favored terrain temporarily. If you spend a full day out of the new favored terrain, your favored terrain reverts back to your original choice when you took the Favored Terrain feat.
