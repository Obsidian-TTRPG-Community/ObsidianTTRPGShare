[witch](../../rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  


You can instantly grow or shrink your hair, eyebrows, beard, or mustache by up to several feet and manipulate your hair for use as a weapon, though your control isn't fine enough for more dexterous tasks. You gain a hair unarmed attack that deals `1d4` bludgeoning damage; is in the brawling group; and has the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md), [disarm](../../rules/traits/disarm.md), [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md), [trip](../../rules/traits/trip.md), and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.
