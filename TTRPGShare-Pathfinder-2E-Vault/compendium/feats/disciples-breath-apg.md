# Disciple's Breath  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Disciple Dedication](dragon-disciple-dedication-apg.md), [dragon breath](../spells/dragon-breath.md) sorcerer bloodline spell
- **Activity** Two-Action

You unleash your breath weapon without spending focus. This has the effects of your [dragon breath](../spells/dragon-breath.md) sorcerer bloodline spell, though it deals `9d6` damage instead of its usual damage, and you don't have to cast it or spend a Focus Point. You can't use Disciple's Breath again for `1d4` rounds.
