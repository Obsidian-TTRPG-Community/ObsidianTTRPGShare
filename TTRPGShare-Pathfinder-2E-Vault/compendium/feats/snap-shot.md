# Snap Shot  *Feat 6*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  


You've learned to react with ranged weapons when a creature is in close quarters. You can use a reaction that normally allows you to make a melee weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) to instead make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). You must be Striking an adjacent target. If necessary for the reaction's trigger, you treat your ranged weapon as if it had a reach of 5 feet. If the reaction has other requirements, such as wielding a specific kind of weapon, Snap Shot doesn't allow you to ignore them; it allows you only to replace a melee weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
