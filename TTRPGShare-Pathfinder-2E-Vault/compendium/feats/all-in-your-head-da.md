# All in Your Head  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 18*  
[psyche](../../rules/traits/psyche-da.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Trigger** You're about to attempt a Fortitude save or a Reflex save.
- **Activity** Reaction

Flames scouring at your body, venom coursing through your veins—you refuse to believe they exist, and nothing can affect you if you don't believe in it. You attempt a Will save against the triggering effect, instead of a Reflex or Fortitude save. You don't gain the benefits of fortress of will or walls of will on this save.
