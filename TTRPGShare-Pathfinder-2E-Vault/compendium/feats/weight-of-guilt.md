# Weight Of Guilt  *Feat 1*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Redeemer cause

Guilt clouds the minds of those who ignore your [Glimpse of Redemption](../../rules/actions/glimpse-of-redemption.md). Instead of making the triggering creature [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), you can make it [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for the same duration.
