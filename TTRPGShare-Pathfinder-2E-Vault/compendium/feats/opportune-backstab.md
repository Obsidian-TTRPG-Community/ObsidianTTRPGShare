# Opportune Backstab  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature within your melee reach is hit by a melee attack from one of your allies.
- **Activity** Reaction

When your enemy is hit by your ally, you capitalize upon the distraction. Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature.
