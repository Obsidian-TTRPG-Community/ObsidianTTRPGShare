# No Escape  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Trigger** A foe within reach attempts to move away from you.
- **Activity** Reaction

You keep pace with a retreating foe. [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed. You can use No Escape to [Burrow](../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
