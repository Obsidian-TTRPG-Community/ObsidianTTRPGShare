# Spell Gem  *Feat 16*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Lich Dedication, legendary in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

Inspired by the degenerate demiliches your kind sometimes devolves into, you've embedded a gem into your brow, fusing it to your necrotic flesh. This gem has been specially calibrated to hold one of the following spells: [repulsion](../spells/repulsion.md), [scrying](../spells/scrying.md), or [true seeing](../spells/true-seeing.md). You must decide which spell your gem contains when you take this feat; changing the spell requires retraining the feat. Once per day, you can drain the gem's magical energy to [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) without spending a spell slot.

At 18th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 7th level. At 20th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 8th level; regardless of which spell you chose, you can instead drain the gem's magical energy to cast an 8th-level [spell turning](../spells/spell-turning.md) without spending a spell slot.
