# Shifting Terrain  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Rough Terrain Stance](rough-terrain-stance-som.md), master in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)
- **Requirements**: Your terrain attunement matches the terrain you're in and you're in Rough Terrain Stance.
- **Activity** Single Action

You slam your fist into the ground or twirl your arms about to cause the terrain around you to shift and ripple, potentially throwing others off balance. Each creature within your area of difficult terrain from Rough Terrain Stance must attempt a Reflex saving throw against your spell DC with the following effects. After you use this action, you can't use it again for `1d4` rounds.

> - **Failure** The creature is [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round and falls [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
