# Legendary Monster Hunter  *Feat 16*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), [Master Monster Hunter](master-monster-hunter.md)

Your knowledge of monsters is so incredible that it reveals glaring flaws in your prey. Your bonus from [Monster Hunter](monster-hunter.md) (and the bonus from [Monster Warden](monster-warden.md) if you have it) increases from +1 to +2 for you and any allies who benefit.
