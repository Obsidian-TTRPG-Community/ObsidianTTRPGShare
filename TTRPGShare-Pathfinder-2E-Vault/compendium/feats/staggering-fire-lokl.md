# Staggering Fire  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [press](../../rules/traits/press.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archer Dedication](archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You've learned how to fire at enemies to slow them down, allowing innocents and fellow knights alike time to escape. Make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a weapon in the bow weapon group. On a hit, the target takes a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed until the end of its turn, or a –10-foot circumstance penalty on a critical hit.
