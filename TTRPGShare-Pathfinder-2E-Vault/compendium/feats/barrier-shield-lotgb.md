# Barrier Shield  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [shield](../spells/shield.md)

When you cast [shield](../spells/shield.md), you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for cover, but not for blocking.

You can't use the [Shield Block](shield-block.md) reaction when the spell is modified in this way, but you (and only you) can spend an action to [Take Cover](../../rules/actions/take-cover.md) to gain standard cover from it.
