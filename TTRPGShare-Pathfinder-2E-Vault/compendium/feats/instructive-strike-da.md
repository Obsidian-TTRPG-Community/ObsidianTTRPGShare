You attack your foe and analyze how it reacts. Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, you can immediately attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the target. On a critical hit, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).
