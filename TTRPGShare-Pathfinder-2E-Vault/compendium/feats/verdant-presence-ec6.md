# Verdant Presence  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You take damage or cast a primal spell.
- **Activity** Reaction

The life-giving properties of the aeon orbs flourish within you. Small plants or fungi magically appear on all surfaces in a 60-foot emanation around you. This life withers after 1 day unless the environment can support it. You can choose one of the following options each time you use this feat.

- You can cause any number of 5-foot squares in the area to be light undergrowth, which is difficult terrain and provides lesser cover.
- You can cause a tree or giant mushroom to appear in any unoccupied location in the area; it occupies an entire 5-foot square and provides standard cover. The tree or mushroom has 5 Hardness and 50 Hit Points.
