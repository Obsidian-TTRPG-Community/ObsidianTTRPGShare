# Arcane Slam  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 9*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: warrior automaton
- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Two-Action

You channel magical power from your core into your arm, empowering your attack as you attempt to slam your foe into the ground. Attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check against the foe's Fortitude DC. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to your check if the target is one size larger than you and a –4 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size smaller than you and a +4 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.

> - **Critical Success** You slam the foe down and the magical energy overwhelms it. The creature is knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), becomes [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round, and takes damage equal to `2d6` plus your Strength modifier. The foe is no longer [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by you.
> - **Success** You slam the foe down. The creature is knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone) and takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The foe is no longer [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by you.
> - **Failure** You are unable to slam the creature, but your hold on the creature remains.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature breaks free and is no longer [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by you.

**Enhancement** Your arms better channel your core's power. You no longer take penalties for attempting to slam larger foes. Your foe takes damage equal to `2d6` plus your Strength modifier on a success (or double that on a critical success).
