# Integrated Armament  *Feat 5*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  


Your mechanical body houses a weapon or shield that you can quickly draw and stow, leaving you prepared for combat at all times.

You can use a 1-minute activity, which has the [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to integrate a single, one-handed weapon or shield into one of your arms. You can draw or stow this item as an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action. Creatures don't automatically see this integrated item when it's stowed and must actively [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) in order to find it. They take a –2 circumstance penalty to any checks to do so. While you are wielding the item, it can't be Disarmed and you can't drop or [Release](../../rules/actions/release.md) it; you must [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to store the weapon and free that hand. A creature determined to retrieve the item can do so, but it requires either 1 minute to remove it or extreme violence to your arm—such as physically removing portions of the limb. You can only have one integrated armament at a time, though you can use the 1-minute activity to replace the item or swap the arm in which it's stored.

**Enhancement** Your body has more space for integration. You can now either integrate two one-handed weapons, a one-handed weapon and a shield, or a single two-handed weapon which is split across both arms. You can use a single [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to draw or store both integrated armaments. When you draw a single weapon, you can choose to hold it with either one hand or both hands.
