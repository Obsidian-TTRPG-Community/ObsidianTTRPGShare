# Death's Drums  *Feat 9*  
[orc](../../rules/traits/orc.md)  


Your life has been spent challenging death itself, and proximity to that implacable foe only makes your heart beat harder. When you are taking [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) or your [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) value is 1 or greater, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saving throws.
