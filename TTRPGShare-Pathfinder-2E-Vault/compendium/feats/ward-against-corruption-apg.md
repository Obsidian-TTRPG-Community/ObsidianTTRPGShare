# Ward Against Corruption  *Feat 5*  
[duskwalker](../../rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  


Your soul is warded against the power of undeath and plague, as well as that of the evil former psychopomps known as sahkils. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [death](../../rules/traits/death.md) effects, disease, and all effects from undead or sahkils. This bonus increases to +2 against an undead or sahkil's [death](../../rules/traits/death.md) effect or disease.
