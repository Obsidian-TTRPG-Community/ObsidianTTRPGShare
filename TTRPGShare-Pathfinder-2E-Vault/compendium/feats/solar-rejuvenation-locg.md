# Solar Rejuvenation  *Feat 9*  
[leshy](../../rules/traits/leshy-b1.md)  


If you rest outdoors for 10 minutes during the day, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. You gain this benefit in addition to any healing from [Treat Wounds](../../rules/actions/treat-wounds.md). Leshies whose plant nourishment does not rely on photosynthesis require a similarly suitable environment. For example, fungus leshies need dark, damp environments and a pile of decaying plant matter.
