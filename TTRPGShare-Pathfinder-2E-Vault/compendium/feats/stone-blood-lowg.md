# Stone Blood  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ka Stone Ritual](ka-stone-ritual-lowg.md)

You can selectively stop your bleeding with ease. Reduce the DC of flat checks to stop [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you have from 15 to 10, and you can use a single action that has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait to gain an early flat check without physically binding the wounds.

You recover naturally from the [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition twice as quickly as normal.
