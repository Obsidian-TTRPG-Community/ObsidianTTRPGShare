# Hurling Charge  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Viking Dedication](viking-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a thrown weapon you already have in your hand, [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), and then [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw another weapon. If you are [raging](../../rules/actions/rage.md), you can add the additional damage with melee weapons you receive from [raging](../../rules/actions/rage.md) to your damage with the thrown weapon.
