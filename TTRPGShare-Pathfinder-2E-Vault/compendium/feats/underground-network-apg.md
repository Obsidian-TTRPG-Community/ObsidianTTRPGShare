# Underground Network  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Society](../skills.md#Society), [Streetwise](streetwise.md)

You're connected to groups that know what's going on in the streets, and you can get information out of them quickly. When you use [Society](../skills.md#Society) to [Gather Information](../../rules/actions/gather-information.md) in an area where you have a network (typically a settlement where you've spent at least a week or spent a day of downtime to build a network faster), you can contact a member of these groups to get information directly from them. This usually takes about an hour, and it doesn't draw as much attention as [Gathering Information](../../rules/actions/gather-information.md) in public might. The check and information gained otherwise follow the normal rules for [Gather Information](../../rules/actions/gather-information.md).
