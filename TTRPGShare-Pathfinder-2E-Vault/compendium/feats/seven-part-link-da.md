# Seven-Part Link  *Feat 16*  
[thaumaturge](../../rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Paired Link

Many traditions hold the number seven as significant. By exchanging pieces of a seven-part set of esoterica, you create a magical web by which your allies can affect each other at a distance. When you use Paired Link during your daily preparations, you can exchange linking esoterica with up to six willing allies, keeping one piece for yourself. In addition to the normal effects of Paired Link, if a linked ally casts a spell with a range of touch, they can target linked allies within 30 feet with that spell.
