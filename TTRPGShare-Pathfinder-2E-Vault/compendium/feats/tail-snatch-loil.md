# Tail Snatch  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[vanara](../../rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You can whip your tail around to lash items from the unwary's grip. You attempt to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) a creature, ignoring the requirement that you must have at least one hand free. As normal, your tail can't hold the items it disarms.
