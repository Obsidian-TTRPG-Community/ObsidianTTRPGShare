# Makeshift Strike  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Weapon Improviser Dedication](weapon-improviser-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You quickly snatch up whatever's nearby and then attack with it as an improvised weapon. You [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to pick up a nearby object you could use as an improvised weapon. It must be located at around your chest level, such as a mug on a table, rather than an object on the floor. You then either [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) or make an [Improvised Pummel](improvised-pummel-apg.md) with the improvised weapon.
