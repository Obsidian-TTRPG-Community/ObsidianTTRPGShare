# Secrets Of Shadow  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shadow Reservoir](shadow-reservoir-som.md)

Your shadow's voice grows ever clearer; it whispers secrets of true power to you and shields your flesh from harm.

Your shadow reservoir gains an additional spell 1 level below the highest level spell you can cast, in addition to the spells it already contains for all the levels below that.

In addition, the tattoos generated by casting shadow spells protect your body against harmful energies. You gain negative resistance equal to the highest level of spell you can cast from spell slots; if you have negative healing (or are otherwise harmed by positive damage and not negative damage), you instead gain positive resistance in the same amount.
