# Minor Magic  *Feat 2*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  


You've dabbled in a variety of tricks, gaining minor magical abilities from a particular tradition. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic, and gain two cantrips from the common cantrips available to that tradition. You gain the [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity. Your key spellcasting ability is Charisma, and you're trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition of your chosen cantrips.
