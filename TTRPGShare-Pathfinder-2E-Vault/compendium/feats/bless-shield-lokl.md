# Bless Shield  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md), you worship a good-aligned deity
- **Activity** Single Action

Your uttered prayers become an aegis, drawing the blessing of your deity across the surface of your shield. Until the beginning of your next turn your shield, any [shield boss](../equipment/items/shield-boss.md), or [shield spikes](../equipment/items/shield-spikes.md) gain the effects of a ghost touch property rune. Additionally, damage you take as a result of an incorporeal creature's [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.
