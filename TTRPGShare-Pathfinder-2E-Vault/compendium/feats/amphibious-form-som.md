# Amphibious Form  *Feat 2*  
[evolution](../../rules/traits/evolution-som.md)  [summoner](../../rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  


Your eidolon adapts to life on land and underwater. It gains the [amphibious](../../rules/traits/amphibious-b1.md) trait, allowing it to breathe in water and air and to avoid the normal –2 penalty for making bludgeoning and slashing unarmed [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) underwater. It gains a swim Speed equal to its land Speed or 25 feet, whichever is less; or if it is normally aquatic, it gains a land Speed equal to its swim Speed or 25 feet, whichever is less.
