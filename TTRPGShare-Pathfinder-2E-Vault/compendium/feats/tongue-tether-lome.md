# Tongue Tether  *Feat 9*  
[grippli](../../rules/traits/grippli-b2.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: snaptongue grippli

Your tongue can momentarily latch on as readily as your hands. So long as you can freely open your mouth, you do not need free hands in order to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md), [Grab an Edge](../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md), or [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md). If you have the Long Tongue feat, you can [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md), [Grab an Edge](../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md), and [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) with your tongue at a distance that is 5 feet beyond your normal reach.
