# Elysium's Cadence  *Feat 6*  
[aftermath](../../rules/traits/aftermath-da.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: You've partied extensively with an azata or entered a romantic relationship with an azata.

You've been ensnared by an azata's infectious enthusiasm for life, love, and freedom that manifests as a pearlescent afterimage in your graceful movements, a spring in your soft steps, an ever-present melody in your euphonic voice, and eddies of passionate colors in your mesmerizing eyes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md), or a +2 circumstance bonus if the target is chaotic good. You gain the [Set](../setting/deities/set-botd.md) Free reaction.

```ad-embed-ability

[fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  

- **Trigger**: You attempt a check to remove or counteract an effect with the [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused), [controlled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled), [fascinated](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [restrained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions

**Effect** You roll twice and use the better result.
