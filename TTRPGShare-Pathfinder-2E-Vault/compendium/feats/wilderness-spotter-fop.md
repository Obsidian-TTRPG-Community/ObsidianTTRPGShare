# Wilderness Spotter  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Expert in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)

Select one type of terrain from the following list: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground. You can use [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) in place of [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) to roll initiative when in the selected terrain in a natural location (not a structure) even if you weren't tracking or otherwise using [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) before the encounter. You can also use [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) instead of [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) to notice traps in natural locations in the chosen terrain; if you find a snare in this way, you can also use [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) instead of [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) to [Disable the Device](../../rules/actions/disable-a-device.md).

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, the feat applies to a new type of terrain.
