# Implausible Purchase (Rogue)  *Feat 18*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Predictive Purchase

Even when impossible, you always have exactly what you need. You can use [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md) even if you have already used it after purchasing goods, and you can [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw the item as a single action instead of a 2-action activity. In addition, five times per day, you can use [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md) to pull out a common consumable item up to 6 levels lower than your level.
