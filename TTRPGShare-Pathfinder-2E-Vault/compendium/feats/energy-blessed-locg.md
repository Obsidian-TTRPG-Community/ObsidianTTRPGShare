# Energy Blessed  *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: elemental heart dwarf heritage (page 19)

Energy runs through your blood more powerfully.

When you use [Energy Emanation](../../rules/actions/energy-emanation-locg.md), you can create an emanation of 5 feet, 10 feet, or 15 feet. The damage increases to `6d6` plus an additional `1d6` for every level you have above 9th, instead of `1d6` plus an additional `1d6` for every 2 levels above 1st.
