# Coordinated Distraction  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Help either the Washboard Dogs or the Diobel Sweepers destroy their rival.
- **Activity** Single Action

With a sharp whistle or wave of your hands, you distract an opponent from the fact that one of your allies is about to attack them. Choose a target and an ally, both of whom must be within 30 feet. The target is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the first [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) the ally makes on their next turn; if your ally doesn't [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that target, the effect is lost. Depending on how you describe your distraction, this action gains either the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) trait.
