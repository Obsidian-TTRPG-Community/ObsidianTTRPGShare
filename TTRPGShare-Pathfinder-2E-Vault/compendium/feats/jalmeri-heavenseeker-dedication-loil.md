# Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Student of Perfection Dedication, or you've trained with a champion of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven

You become trained in either [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism); if you were already trained in both these skills, you become an expert in one of them instead. You gain either the Ki Rush or [Ki Strike](ki-strike.md) monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [Refocus](../../rules/actions/refocus.md) activity as a monk does. If you already have both feats, you can instead choose a single 1st-level monk feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the Jalmeri Heavenseeker or Student of Perfection archetypes.
