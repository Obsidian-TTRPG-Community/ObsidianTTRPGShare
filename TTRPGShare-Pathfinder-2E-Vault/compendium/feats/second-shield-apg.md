# Second Shield  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Viking Dedication](viking-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** Your [Shield Block](shield-block.md) causes your shield to break or be destroyed.
- **Activity** Free Action

You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself. You can [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield—for example, a table or chair— you can [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield. Your new shield isn't raised until you use the [Raise a Shield](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) action, as normal.
