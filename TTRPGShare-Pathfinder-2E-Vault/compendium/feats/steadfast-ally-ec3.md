# Steadfast Ally  *Feat 13*  
[shoony](../../rules/traits/shoony-ec3.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Loyal Empath

Your presence alone is enough to provide your allies with emotional support. You can use the [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) reaction to grant a bonus to another creature's Will saving throw even when you haven't prepared to help.
