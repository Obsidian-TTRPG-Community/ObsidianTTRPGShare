# Predictive Purchase (Investigator)  *Feat 6*  
[investigator](../../rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  


You have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md) and [Prescient Consumable](prescient-consumable-apg.md) feats. When using [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md), you can pull out the item as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or a similar container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.
