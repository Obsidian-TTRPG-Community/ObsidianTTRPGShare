# Nimble Hooves  *Feat 1*  
[tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


Your legs end in hooves rather than feet, with joints and tendons that allow you to move with great haste. Your Speed increases by 5 feet.

**Special.** The Speed increase from this feat isn't cumulative with any Speed increase from your ancestry feats (such as [Nimble Elf](nimble-elf.md)).
