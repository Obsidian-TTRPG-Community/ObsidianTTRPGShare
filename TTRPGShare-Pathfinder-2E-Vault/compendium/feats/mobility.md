# Mobility  *Feat 2*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  


You move in a way that denies your enemies the opportunity to retaliate. When you take a [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) action to move half your Speed or less, that movement does not trigger reactions. You can use Mobility when [Climbing](../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
