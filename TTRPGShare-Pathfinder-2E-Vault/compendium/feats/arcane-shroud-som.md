# Arcane Shroud  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Arcane Cascade](../../rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md), [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)
- **Frequency**: once per turn
- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from a spell slot or make a [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) with a spell from a spell slot.
- **Activity** Single Action

Your spell has a powerful aftereffect, briefly granting you a certain spell depending on the spell you cast. You use [Arcane Cascade](../../rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) and are subject to an additional aftereffect spell depending on the school of your most recent spell. This aftereffect spell's duration lasts until the end of your next turn or its normal duration, whichever is longer. Using Arcane Shroud again ends any existing spell you gained from Arcane Shroud.
