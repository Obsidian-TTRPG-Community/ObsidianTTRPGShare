# Lingering Flames  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [fireball](../spells/fireball.md)

When you cast [fireball](../spells/fireball.md), you can modify its effects, decreasing the base damage to `5d6` and causing it to deal 2 [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to creatures that fail their save, doubled as normal on a critical failure. If you do, replace its heightened entry with the following.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage is increased by `1d6` and the [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is increased by 2.
