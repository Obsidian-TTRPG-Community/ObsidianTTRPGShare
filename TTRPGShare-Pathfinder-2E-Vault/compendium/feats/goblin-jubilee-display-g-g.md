# Goblin Jubilee Display  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Firework Technician Dedication](firework-technician-dedication-g-g.md)

Flames and explosions sear the air in a riot of color and devastation that rivals that wrought by even the wildest goblin party. The display is both so beautiful and chaotic that, while mesmerizing, it poses a significant risk to the physical health, sight, and hearing of anyone who gets too close. You gain the Goblin Jubilee fireworks display.

title: Goblin Jubilee [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")
[fire](../../../rules/traits/fire.md)  [sonic](../../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Cost**: 3 batches of infused reagents

Chaos fills a 20-foot burst within 120 feet. All creatures in the area takes `3d6` fire damage and `3d6` sonic damage and must attempt a Fortitude save.

A goblin jubilee display costs 3 batches of infused reagents, rather than 1.
