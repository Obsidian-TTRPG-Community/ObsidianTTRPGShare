# Unlimited Potential  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 20*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

The laws of magic can limit your mind only if you think you need them, and you've grown past the need for such limits. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don't expend the prepared spell as you cast it.
