# Velstrac Magic  *Feat 9*  
[tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shackleborn](shackleborn-loag.md)

You know there's so much more to sensation than whips and chains—but whips and chains also have their place. You can cast [telekinetic maneuver](../spells/telekinetic-maneuver.md) and [web](../spells/web.md) once per day each as 2nd-level divine innate spells; in both cases, the spells manifest shadowy chains rather than their usual visual signifiers.
