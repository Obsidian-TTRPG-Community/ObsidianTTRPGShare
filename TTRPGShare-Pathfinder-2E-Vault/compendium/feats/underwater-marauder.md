# Underwater Marauder  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

You've learned to fight underwater. You are not [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) while in water, and you don't take the usual penalties for using a bludgeoning or slashing melee weapon in water.
