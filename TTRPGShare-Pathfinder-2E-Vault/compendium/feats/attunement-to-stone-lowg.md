# Attunement To Stone  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ka Stone Ritual](ka-stone-ritual-lowg.md)

You become attuned to the stone around you. When in contact with a stone surface, you gain [tremorsense](../../rules/abilities/tremorsense.md) (imprecise) 5 feet along that surface, and you can activate your ka stone to cast [meld into stone](../spells/meld-into-stone.md).
