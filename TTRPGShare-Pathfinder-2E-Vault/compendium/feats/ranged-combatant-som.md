# Ranged Combatant  *Feat 2*  
[evolution](../../rules/traits/evolution-som.md)  [summoner](../../rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  


Spines, flame jets, and holy blasts are just some of the ways your eidolon might strike from a distance. It gains a ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 30 feet that deals `1d4` damage and has the [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md) and [propulsive](../../rules/traits/propulsive.md) traits. When you select this feat, choose a damage type: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, positive, or slashing.

If your eidolon is a celestial, fiend, or monitor with an alignment other than true neutral, you can choose a damage type in its alignment.
