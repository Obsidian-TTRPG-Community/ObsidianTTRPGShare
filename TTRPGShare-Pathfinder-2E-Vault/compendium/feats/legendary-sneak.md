# Legendary Sneak  *Feat 15*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth), [Swift Sneak](swift-sneak.md)

You're always sneaking unless you choose to be seen, even when there's nowhere to hide. You can [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) even without cover or being [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed). When you employ an exploration tactic other than [Avoiding Notice](../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md), you also gain the benefits of [Avoiding Notice](../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) unless you choose not to. See page 479 for more information about exploration tactics.
