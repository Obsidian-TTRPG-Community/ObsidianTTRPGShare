# Kneel For No God  *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  

- **Access**: Vahird ethnicity
- **Prerequisites**: ancient-blooded dwarf heritage

Your ancestors' defiance of magic and your people's strictly egalitarian mindset mean that certain forms of magic have little effect on you. When you use your [Call on Ancient Blood](../../rules/actions/call-on-ancient-blood.md) reaction against a divine spell and roll a critical failure on the saving throw against that spell, you get a failure instead.
