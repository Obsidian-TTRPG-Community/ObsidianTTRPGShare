# Alchemical Discoveries  *Feat 4*  
[investigator](../../rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: alchemical sciences methodology

You've devoted extra time in the lab to improve your knowledge of alchemy. You learn the formulas for two alchemical items each time you level up instead of one; these must still be elixirs or tools. The number of versatile vials you can create each day increases by 1 if you're an expert in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), 2 if you're a master, or 3 if you're legendary.
