# Improved Twin Riposte (Fighter)  *Feat 14*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Twin Riposte

Your weapons are a blur, blocking and biting at your foes. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to perform a Twin Riposte. You can use this extra reaction even if you are not benefiting from [Twin Parry](twin-parry-fighter.md).
