# Spell Mastery  *Feat 20*  
[wizard](../../rules/traits/wizard.md)  


You have mastered a handful of spells to such a degree that you can cast them even if you haven't prepared them in advance. Select any four spells of 9th level or lower that you have access to; each spell you select must be of a different level. These spells are automatically prepared when you make your daily preparations, and they have their own spell slots. You can select a different array of spells by spending 1 week of downtime retraining your mastered spells.
