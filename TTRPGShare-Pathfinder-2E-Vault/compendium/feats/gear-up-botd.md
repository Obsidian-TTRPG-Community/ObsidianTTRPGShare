# Gear Up  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Slayer Dedication](undead-slayer-dedication-botd.md)

Whether it's wooden stakes, [holy water](../equipment/items/holy-water.md), or more unusual tools, you always have just the right thing to handle an undead's unusual weaknesses and vulnerabilities. You gain the [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md) and [Prescient Consumable](prescient-consumable-apg.md) feats. When using Prescient Planner specifically to pull out an item you need to deal with an undead's weakness or vulnerability, you can pull out the item as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or similar container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute. If you have the [Hunter's Sanctum](hunters-sanctum-botd.md) feat, you keep your sanctum well stocked with the basics and can spend 1 hour in your sanctum refreshing your supplies in order to meet the requirements for Prescient Planner, even if you haven't been able to purchase goods.
