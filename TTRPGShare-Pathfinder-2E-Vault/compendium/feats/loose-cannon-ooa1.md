[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Alkenstar Agent Dedication
- **Activity** Single Action

Your unpredictable gunfire often catches enemies off guard or hits unprotected areas. Make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a firearm against a creature that you haven't already attacked on this turn. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage on this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) equal to the number of weapon damage dice. The [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) gains the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** The firearm misfires, but it doesn't cause the other critical failure effects listed below.
> - **Critical Failure** The firearm misfires and also explodes.
>
>    It becomes [broken](../../rules/conditions.md#Broken), and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the firearm, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. This damage includes any from the weapon's fundamental and property runes.
