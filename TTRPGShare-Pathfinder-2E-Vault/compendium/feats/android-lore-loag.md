# Android Lore  *Feat 1*  
[android](../../rules/traits/android-loag.md)  


You have a keen interest in the origins of your people. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) and [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Android Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
