# Prescient Consumable  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md)

You can predict which consumables you might need in advance. When using [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md), you can procure a consumable item from your backpack, instead of a piece of adventuring gear. The consumable item must still be common with a level no higher than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn't have made you [encumbered](../../rules/conditions.md#Encumbered).
