# Progenitor Lore  *Feat 1*  
[reflection](../../rules/traits/reflection-da.md)  


You didn't just inherit your physical form from your progenitor; you also retained some of their knowledge. You're trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) and [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) corresponding to your ancestry (e. g., [Elf Lore](../skills.md#Lore) if your progenitor is an elf).
