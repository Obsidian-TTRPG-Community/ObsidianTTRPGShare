# Agile Grace  *Feat 10*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  


Your graceful moves with agile weapons are beyond compare. Your multiple attack penalty with [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) weapons and [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) unarmed attacks becomes –3 for your second attack and –6 for subsequent attacks (rather than –4 and –8).
