# Divine Health  *Feat 4*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

Your faith makes you resistant to disease, protecting you as you offer succor to the ill. You gain a +1 status bonus to saves against [diseases](../../rules/traits/disease.md). In addition, if you roll a success on a save against a disease, you get a critical success instead.
