# Well-Armed  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[skeleton](../../rules/traits/skeleton-b1.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Your detachable limbs offer flexibility. You [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to remove your arm and wield it in the other one, increasing your reach by 5 feet for any one-handed weapon held in that arm. If your next action is a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with that weapon, creatures that were outside your reach that you can now hit are [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your first attack. You don't have a free hand while holding the arm. You can [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to reattach the arm while holding it.
