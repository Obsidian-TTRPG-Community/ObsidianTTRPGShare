# Duo's Aim  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

With assistance from your spotter, you aim for an especially accurate attack. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe either within your spotter's melee reach or the first range increment of a ranged weapon your spotter is wielding. On this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's concealment. If you're using a firearm with the kickback trait, you don't take the normal circumstance penalty to this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) for not having the required Strength score or firing without using a tripod.
