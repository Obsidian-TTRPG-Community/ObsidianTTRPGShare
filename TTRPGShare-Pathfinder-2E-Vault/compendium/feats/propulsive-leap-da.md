# Propulsive Leap  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*

- **Activity** Single Action

By expelling flames from your feet or levitating through electrical repulsion, you propel yourself through the air. For 1 minute, you gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed or 20 feet, whichever is greater. If you aren't on solid ground at the end of your turn, you must attempt another backlash check for your deviation, though you remain airborne even if you fail your check unless the damage from the check renders you [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).

**Awakening** You blast through the air at great speed, gaining a +15-foot status bonus to your [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md) speed from Propulsive [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md).

**Awakening** You can use your propulsion as a makeshift weapon. The first time each round you [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md) starting from the ground, all creatures adjacent to you take `1d4` damage for every 2 levels you have, with a basic Reflex save.
