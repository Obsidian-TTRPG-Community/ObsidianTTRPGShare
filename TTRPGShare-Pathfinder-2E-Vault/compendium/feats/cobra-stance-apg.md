# Cobra Stance  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a tight stance, coiled up like a lashing cobra with your hands poised as venomous fangs. While in this stance, the only [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are cobra fang unarmed attacks.

These deal `1d4` poison damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md), [deadly <d10>](../../rules/traits/deadly.md), [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md), [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md), and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While in Cobra Stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves and your Fortitude DC, and you gain poison resistance equal to half your level.

## Cobra Stance leads to...
