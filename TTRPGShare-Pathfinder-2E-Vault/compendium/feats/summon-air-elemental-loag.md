# Summon Air Elemental  *Feat 13*  
[sylph](../../rules/traits/sylph-b2.md)  


You have a connection to the Inner Spheres, allowing you to summon an elemental ally. Once per day, you can cast [summon elemental](../spells/summon-elemental.md) as a 5th-level primal innate spell, but the elemental summoned must be an air elemental.
