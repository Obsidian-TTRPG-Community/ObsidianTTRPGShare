# Steadying Stone  *Feat 1*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: stone order

The earth has taught you how to remain unyielding and firm. If you roll a success on an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check made to [Balance](../../rules/actions/balance.md) on uneven ground composed of earth or rock, you get a critical success instead. As long as you remain on the ground, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) or [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that would attempt to knock you [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). If you're a rock dwarf, this bonus increases to +3.
