# Elaborate Flourish  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*

- **Activity** Single Action

You embellish your spellcasting with entrancing flourishes and grand pronouncements, making it harder to identify or counter. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), creatures with the ability to [Cast that Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) don't automatically know what the spell is. In addition, creatures that witness your spellcasting take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks to identify the spell with [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) and checks to counteract the spell during its casting (such as with Counterspell).
