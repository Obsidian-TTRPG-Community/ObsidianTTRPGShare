# Rope Runner  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pirate Dedication](pirate-dedication-apg.md); trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) and [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes. Whenever you succeed at an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md) a rope or an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](../../rules/actions/balance.md) on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) while [Climbing](../../rules/actions/climb.md) or [Balancing](../../rules/actions/balance.md) on a rope.
