# Shorthanded  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  


Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with a very specific minimum number of members designed to ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon.

In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people, provided you know what you're doing. You can operate a siege weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an increasing penalty. You and your crew take a –2 penalty to checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or [Repair](../../rules/actions/repair.md) the weapon for each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take a –10 penalty when doing so.
