# Phase Bullet  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellshot Dedication](spellshot-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You can aim your bullets not just in three normal dimensions, but in additional dimensions as well, allowing you to fire a magical shot that phases through everything but your target. Make a crossbow or firearm [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe who's [observed](../../rules/conditions.md#Observed) or [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to you (but not [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected)). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers and [force](../../rules/traits/force.md) effects stop the bullet. The shot ignores all cover, the [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition, the [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage can't be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a non-magical shield.
