# Feathered Cloak  *Feat 5*  
[strix](../../rules/traits/strix-loag.md)  


To blend in with the grounded and wingless, you fold your wings just so on your back, creating the illusion of a feathered cloak. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) a version of yourself who is not a strix.

Additionally, your folded wings help you obscure objects on your person, providing a +2 circumstance bonus to [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Conceal an Object](../../rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md).
