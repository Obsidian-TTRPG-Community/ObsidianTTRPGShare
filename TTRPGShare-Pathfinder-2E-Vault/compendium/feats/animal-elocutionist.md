# Animal Elocutionist  *Feat 5*  
[gnome](../../rules/traits/gnome.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Burrow Elocutionist](burrow-elocutionist.md)

You hear animal sounds as conversations instead of unintelligent noise, and can respond in turn. You can speak to all animals, not just animals with a burrow Speed. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on animals (which usually uses the [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) skill).
