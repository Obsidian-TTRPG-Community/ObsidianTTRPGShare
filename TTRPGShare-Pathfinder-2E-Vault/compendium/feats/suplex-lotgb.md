# Suplex  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wrestler Dedication](wrestler-dedication-lotgb.md)
- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Single Action

Flexing your entire body, you heave your opponent over your head and slam them into the ground. Make an unarmed melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the creature you have [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained); on a success, the target lands [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and on a critical success, the target lands [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone) and takes an additional `2d6` bludgeoning damage. Regardless of whether the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) is successful, you immediately release your hold on the target.
