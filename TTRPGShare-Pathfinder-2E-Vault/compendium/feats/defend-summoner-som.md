# Defend Summoner  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[eidolon](../../rules/traits/eidolon-som.md)  [evolution](../../rules/traits/evolution-som.md)  [summoner](../../rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Your eidolon blocks attacks against you. After your eidolon uses this action, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. This bonus applies only while you're within your eidolon's reach (in most cases, this means your eidolon is adjacent to you or in your space).
