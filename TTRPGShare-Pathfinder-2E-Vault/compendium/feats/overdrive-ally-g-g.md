# Overdrive Ally  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You are currently in overdrive.
- **Activity** Single Action

You quickly fling some of your powered-up mechanisms to an ally, sharing your benefits with them briefly. Choose an ally within 30 feet. Until the end of their next turn, that ally's [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deal additional damage equal to half your Intelligence modifier, or your full Intelligence modifier if you were in critical overdrive. The ally doesn't gain the increased damage from expert, master, or legendary overdrive.
