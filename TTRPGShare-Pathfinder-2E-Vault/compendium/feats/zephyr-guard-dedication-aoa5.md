# Zephyr Guard Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Katapesh.
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Zephyr Guard

As a Zephyr Guard, you're always vigilant against crime and threats to the city's safety. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks against attempts to [Palm an Object](../../rules/actions/palm-an-object.md), [Steal](../../rules/actions/steal.md), or [Conceal an Object](../../rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) (including you're Seeking [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) objects). You become trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society) and [Katapesh Lore](../skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Zephyr Guard archetype.
