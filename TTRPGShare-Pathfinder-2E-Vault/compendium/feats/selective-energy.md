# Selective Energy  *Feat 6*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  


As you call down divine power, you can prevent some enemies from benefiting or some allies from being hurt. When you cast a version of [harm](../spells/harm.md) or [heal](../spells/heal.md) that has an area, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) that are not targeted by the spell.
