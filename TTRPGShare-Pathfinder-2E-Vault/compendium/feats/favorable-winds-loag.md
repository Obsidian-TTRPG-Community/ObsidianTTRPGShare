# Favorable Winds  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[air](../../rules/traits/air.md)  [changeling](../../rules/traits/changeling-b1.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Virga May](virga-may-loag.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You wrap a shell of favorable wind around a weapon you wield. On your next [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon before the start of your next turn, you don't take circumstance penalties on the attack roll due to wind. In addition, if that weapon has a range increment of 10 feet or less, increase its range increment by 10 feet for that [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
