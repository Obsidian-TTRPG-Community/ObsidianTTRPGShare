# Shared Clarity  *Feat 18*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Premonition of Clarity](premonition-of-clarity-apg.md)

You can project your premonitions of clarity to your allies. When you use [Premonition of Clarity](premonition-of-clarity-apg.md), allies within 15 feet of you who failed the same saving throw against the same [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect can also spend their reactions to reroll the failed saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus.
