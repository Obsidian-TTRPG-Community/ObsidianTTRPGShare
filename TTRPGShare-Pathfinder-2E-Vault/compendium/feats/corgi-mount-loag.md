# Corgi Mount  *Feat 1*  
[sprite](../../rules/traits/sprite-b1.md)  


The smallest of fey have ridden corgis as mounts since time immemorial, leading to a pattern on corgis' backs called a "faerie saddle." You have formed a magical connection with a corgi that can serve as your mount. Your corgi familiar is Small rather than Tiny, and it's appropriate for use as your mount, unlike most familiars.

It has the [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md) ability, which counts against your limit for familiar and master abilities as normal. Furthermore, it can never gain a familiar ability that grants it any Speeds other than a land Speed. If you're a pixie, you can't ride a corgi due to your Size, but you can take this feat to gain a corgi familiar.
