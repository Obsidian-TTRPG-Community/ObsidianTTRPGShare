# Shattering Shot  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or loaded crossbow and are wearing or holding an alchemical bomb.
- **Activity** Single Action

You fling a bomb into the air and then shoot it with your gun before it falls, raining destruction down over a wide area. If necessary, you [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw the bomb and regrip your weapon. You throw your bomb to the corner of a square within your firearm's first range increment and shoot it with your firearm. All creatures in a 15-foot burst of the bomb take the bomb's normal damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. They don't take any splash or [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) the bomb would deal normally.
