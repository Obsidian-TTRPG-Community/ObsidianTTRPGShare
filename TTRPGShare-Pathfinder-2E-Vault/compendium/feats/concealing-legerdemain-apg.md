# Concealing Legerdemain  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery)

Rather than hide an object somewhere the inspectors won't search, you're skilled at keeping the object on the move so it's never where they look. When you [Conceal an Object](../../rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) of light Bulk or less, you can use [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) instead of [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) for your checks and for the DC of an active searcher's [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check. You roll the check only once, but you must continue to use actions to [Conceal an Object](../../rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) throughout the process.
