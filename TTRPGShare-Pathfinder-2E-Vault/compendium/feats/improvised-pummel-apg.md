# Improvised Pummel  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Weapon Improviser Dedication](weapon-improviser-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding an improvised weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your wielded improvised weapon. You gain a +1 item bonus to the attack roll, and the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deals two weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer. If the attack is a critical hit, in addition to the effect of the critical hit, the improvised weapon breaks. If the item has a Hardness greater than your level, or if it's an artifact, cursed item, or other item that's difficult to break or destroy, the item doesn't break and the attack is a hit instead of a critical hit.

At 12th level, your item bonus to the attack roll increases to +2 instead of +1, and at 16th level, the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deals three weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer, instead of two.
