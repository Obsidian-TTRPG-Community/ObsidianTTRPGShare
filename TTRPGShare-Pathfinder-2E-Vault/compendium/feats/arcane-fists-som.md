# Arcane Fists  *Feat 1*  
[magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  


Your physical training encompasses unarmed combat forms. The damage die for your fist changes to `1d6` instead of `1d4`. You don't take the normal –2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks. Your unarmed attacks gain the [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md) trait, making them magical. At 5th level, you also gain the critical specialization effects of unarmed attacks in the brawling group and weapons in the brawling group.
