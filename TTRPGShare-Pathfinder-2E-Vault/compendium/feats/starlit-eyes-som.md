# Starlit Eyes  *Feat 4*  
[magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Arcane Cascade](../../rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md), starlit span hybrid study

Starlight shines in your sight, enhancing your perception and range. When you make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) while in [Arcane Cascade](../../rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) stance, you lower the DC of your flat check to target a creature that's [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you. The DC is reduced to 3 instead of 5 against a [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) creature and to 9 instead of 11 against a [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) one. When you cast [shooting star](../spells/shooting-star-som.md) and target a hidden creature, you don't have to attempt the flat check for targeting a [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creature with a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
