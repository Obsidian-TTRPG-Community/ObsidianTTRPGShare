# Overlooked Mastermind  *Feat 1*  
[half-orc](../../rules/traits/half-orc.md)  


Many consider half-orcs little more than dumb brutes. This is offensive to you, but it can occasionally be useful. You are trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) (or another skill of your choice if you were already trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)), and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) when specifically claiming ignorance and to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) DCs against [Sense Motive](../../rules/actions/sense-motive.md) checks to uncover such lies.
