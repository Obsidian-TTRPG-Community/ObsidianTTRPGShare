# Shared Overdrive  *Feat 12*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) Ally

You've experimented enough on your teammates to transfer a substantial number of powered-up gizmos to them, enabling one of your allies to benefit from the full effects and duration of your [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md). The first time you use [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) Ally during a given [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md), the effect lasts for the remainder of the duration of your [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md), instead of just until the end of the target's next turn. Any further uses of [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) Ally during the same [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) have their normal duration, per [Overdrive](../../rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) Ally.
