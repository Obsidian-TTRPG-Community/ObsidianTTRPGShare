# Animal Magic  *Feat 9*  
[beastkin](../../rules/traits/beastkin-loag.md)  


Your shapeshifting grants you a magical connection to the animal world. You can cast [animal messenger](../spells/animal-messenger.md), [calm emotions](../spells/calm-emotions.md) (animals only), and [speak with animals](../spells/speak-with-animals.md) as 2nd-level primal innate spells once per day each. These spells use your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
