# Unbalancing Blow  *Feat 2*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Thief racket

Interweaving your most powerful attacks in a graceful flow, you temporarily unbalance your foes. Whenever your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) is a critical hit and deals damage, the target is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your attacks until the end of your next turn.
