# Firebrand Braggart Dedication  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 14, second mark member of the Firebrands
- **Activity** Single Action

Your Firebrand training has taught you that achieving something is more satisfying if you boast about it first. You declare a boast about a particular skill action, such as [Balance](../../rules/actions/balance.md), [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md), or [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). The first time you attempt this action within the next minute in a context the GM deems both suitably challenging and meaningful, you must roll twice and use the lower result. If you succeed at this check, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to attempt the same action for 10 minutes.

If you fail this check or don't attempt the action within 1 minute, you instead take a –1 circumstance penalty on checks to attempt the same action for 1 hour.

If the chosen action can be used with multiple skills, such as [Identify Magic](../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md) or [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), you must specify which skill you are using for that particular action, such as using [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) to [Identify Magic](../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md), and your bonus or penalty after the boast applies only to checks using that skill for that action. Once you declare a boast about a particular action, you cannot declare a boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check.

Typically a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action's success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals, rather than a boast you made simply to gain a bonus later.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Firebrand Braggart archetype.
