# Goloma Courage  *Feat 1*  
[goloma](../../rules/traits/goloma-lome.md)  


The most important thing you've learned living with fear is how to overcome it. When you roll a success on a saving throw against a [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves against [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effects and a +2 circumstance bonus to your Will DC against attempts to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) you.
