# Arcane Camouflage  *Feat 9*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: hunter automaton

You have developed magical techniques to aid you with stalking your prey. You can cast [blur](../spells/blur.md) and [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.md) each once per day as 2nd-level arcane innate spells.

**Enhancement** Your camouflage is more potent. Your [blur](../spells/blur.md) spell now lasts 10 minutes and when you cast [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.md), you can choose to gain the effects of the 4th-level version of the spell. In addition, you can now cast [blur](../spells/blur.md) and [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.md) each twice per day.
