# Uncanny Cheeks  *Feat 9*  
[ratfolk](../../rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md)  


You squirrel away useful objects and seem to retrieve them at just the right time.

You gain the [Prescient Consumable](prescient-consumable-apg.md) and [Prescient Planner](prescient-planner-apg.md) feats, except that you always withdraw the objects from your cheek pouches. This means the object you retrieve must fit in your cheek pouches; this is generally an item of negligible Bulk unless you also have the [Cheek Pouches](cheek-pouches-apg.md) feat.
