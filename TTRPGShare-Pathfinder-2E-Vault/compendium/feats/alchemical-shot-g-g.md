# Alchemical Shot  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have an alchemical bomb worn or in one hand, and are wielding a firearm or crossbow in the other.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've practiced a technique for mixing alchemical bombs with your loaded shot. You [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to retrieve the bomb (if it's not already in your hand) and pour its contents onto your ammunition, consuming the bomb. Next, [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your firearm. The [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deals damage of the same type as the bomb (for instance, fire damage for alchemist's fire), and it deals an additional `1d6` [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) of the same type as the bomb. If the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) is a failure, you take `1d6` damage of the same type as the bomb you used, and the firearm misfires.

The [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases to `2d6` if the bomb is 11th level or higher, or `3d6` if it's 17th level or higher.
