# Cut The Bonds  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bellflower Dedication](bellflower-dedication-aoa3.md), expert in a melee weapon
- **Activity** Single Action

Select a [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md) effect that has made an adjacent member of your crop [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [paralyzed](../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained), or [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed). Attempt a counteract check using your attack modifier (including your multiple attack penalty) with a melee weapon with which you have expert proficiency. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up. On a success, you free that member from the effect; on a failure, you can't attempt to use Cut the Bonds on that effect on that crop member until 24 hours have passed.
