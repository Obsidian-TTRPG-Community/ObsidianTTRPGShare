# Sense Chaos  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Dedication](hellknight-dedication-locg.md)

You sense chaos as an unsettling feeling of nervous energy. When in the presence of an aura of chaos that is [powerful or overwhelming](../../rules/tables/alignment-aura.md), you eventually detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly and you can't pinpoint the location. This is a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. A chaotic creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check against your [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check, it is temporarily immune to your Sense Chaos for 1 day.
