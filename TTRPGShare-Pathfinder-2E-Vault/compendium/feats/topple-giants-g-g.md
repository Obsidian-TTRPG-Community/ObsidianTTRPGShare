# Topple Giants  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Overwatch Dedication](overwatch-dedication-g-g.md)

When you observe an ally try and fail to execute a strategic maneuver against your enemies, you coordinate with your other allies to finish the job, using the opening from the first attempt to keep your foe off-balance and ensure your eventual success.

When an ally within your overwatch field attempts to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) an opponent within your overwatch field and fails, you coordinate efforts to provide a +2 circumstance bonus to the next [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check rolled by a different ally to attempt the same action on the same target before that target's next turn.
