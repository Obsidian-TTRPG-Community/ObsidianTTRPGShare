# Can't Fall Here  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [hobgoblin](../../rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** An adjacent and willing ally would be reduced to 0 HP but not killed.
- **Activity** Reaction

You physically help an ally remain standing and encourage them to push through their pain against dire odds. Your ally doesn't fall [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and remains at 1 Hit Point. The ally also gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last for 1 minute. Fighting onward with such an injury isn't without consequence; your ally's [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition increases by 1.
