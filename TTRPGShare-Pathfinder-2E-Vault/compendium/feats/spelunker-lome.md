# Spelunker  *Feat 1*  
[shisk](../../rules/traits/shisk-lome.md)  


Living underground, you have learned to find your way without landmarks or even solid ground. If you roll a success on an [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) check to [Sense Direction](../../rules/actions/sense-direction.md) or an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md), you get a critical success instead. You're not [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) when you attempt to [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md).
