# Bound in Ice  *Feat 16*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Frostbite Runes](frostbite-runes-lomm.md)

You become a hybrid of your ancestry and a saumen kar. Your size increases to Large, and your reach becomes 10 feet. Your cold resistance increases to be equal to your level, and you gain fire resistance equal to half your level.

You also gain the Blizzard Evasion reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Blizzard Evasion [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You take 40 or more physical damage from a single attack

**Effect** You designate a single creature as your mark. This lasts until the mark dies or you use Mark for Death again. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) your mark and on [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md) against your mark. Your [agile](../../../rules/traits/agile.md) and [finesse](../../../rules/traits/finesse.md) weapons and unarmed attacks gain the backstabber and [deadly <d6>](../../../rules/traits/deadly.md) weapon traits when you're attacking your mark.

If the weapon or unarmed attack already has the [deadly](../../../rules/traits/deadly.md) trait, increase the size of the deadly damage die by one step instead of giving it deadly <d6>.
