# Winglets  *Feat 5*  
[kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  


You're among the few kobolds who grow a set of draconic wings later in life. The wings are initially small and weak; while not enough for full flight, a strong flap allows you to jump further.

When Leaping horizontally, you move an additional 5 feet (this additional distance isn't cumulative with the increased [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) distance from the [Powerful Leap](powerful-leap.md) feat). You don't automatically fail your checks to [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) if you don't [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) at least 10 feet first.

In addition, when you attempt a [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md), you can jump a distance up to 10 feet longer than you normally would based on the result of your [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check, though you still can't jump farther than your Speed.

## Winglets leads to...

[Hatchling Flight](hatchling-flight-loag.md), [Wyrmling Flight](wyrmling-flight-loag.md)
