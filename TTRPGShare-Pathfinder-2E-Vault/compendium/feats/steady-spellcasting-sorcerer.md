# Steady Spellcasting (Sorcerer)  *Feat 6*  
[sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  


You are confident in your spellcasting technique, and you are more easily able to retain your concentration when you [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md). If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn't disrupted.
