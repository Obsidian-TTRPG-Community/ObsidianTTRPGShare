# Underhanded Assault  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 2*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You capitalize on the distraction provided by an ally. You [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) up to a foe adjacent to one of your allies. You can roll against the foe you're [Sneaking](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) up on, even if it's currently [observing](../../rules/conditions.md#Observed) you, as though you were [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden). You take a –2 penalty on your [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check. If your [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check against the chosen foe succeeds, you can make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against that foe at the end of your [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md).
