# Finessed Features  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Trapsmith Dedication](trapsmith-dedication-g-g.md)

You've learned how to build snares that trigger based on visual stimuli. When you construct a snare using gears, you can cause it to trigger based on the visual features of a creature. For example, you could lay a snare that can only be triggered by a Large or Larger creatures, or one that only activates when a creature wearing red clothing would trigger it. You can use this ability to specify your snares to trigger on creatures that typically do not trigger snares, such as creatures smaller than Small, though the creature must still otherwise satisfy the snare's trigger as normal.

Trick Driver While cavaliers follow an old and tired tradition of mounted combat, you take a more modern road. Through aggressive use of vehicles, you roll across the battlefield, taking down your opponents. You go beyond simply operating a vehicle, pushing it to perform stunts that its builders never intended, transforming the vehicle into something much greater than a mere conveyance.
