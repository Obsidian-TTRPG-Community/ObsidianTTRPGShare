- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

You can cast your spells effortlessly by tapping into the leylines of the world. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don't expend the prepared spell as you cast it.
