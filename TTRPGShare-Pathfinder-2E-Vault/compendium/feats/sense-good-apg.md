# Sense Good  *Feat 8*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil

The presence of goodness sickens you with its saccharine self-righteousness. When in the presence of an [aura of good that is powerful or overwhelming](../../rules/tables/alignment-aura.md), you detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location. This acts as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. A good creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check against your [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Good for 1 day.
