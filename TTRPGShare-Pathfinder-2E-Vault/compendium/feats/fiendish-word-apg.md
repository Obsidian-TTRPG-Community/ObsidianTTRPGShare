# Fiendish Word  *Feat 17*  
[tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


You can call forth a blasphemous word from the fiendish realms to punish your foes. Once per day, you can cast [divine decree](../spells/divine-decree.md) as a 7th-level divine innate spell. You must choose evil for the spell, and you can [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) regardless of whether you have a deity or what their alignment is.
