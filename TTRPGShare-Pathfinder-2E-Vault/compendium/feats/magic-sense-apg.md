# Magic Sense  *Feat 12*  
[detection](../../rules/traits/detection.md)  [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [oracle](../../rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  


You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md) spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md), you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md) spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
