# Guarded Thoughts  *Feat 9*  
[nagaji](../../rules/traits/nagaji-loil.md)  


Your mind, like a dark naga's, foils attempts to read your thoughts.

Any effect that specifically attempts to read your mind to glean information must succeed at a counteract check against the higher of your class DC or your spell DC to do so successfully; otherwise, it gains no information. The counteract level is equal to half your level rounded up.
