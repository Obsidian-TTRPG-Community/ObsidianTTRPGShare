# Duskwalker Magic  *Feat 9*  
[duskwalker](../../rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  


Your connection to psychopomps gives you the power to glimpse the near future and protect corpses from the ravages of undeath. You can cast [augury](../spells/augury.md) and [gentle repose](../spells/gentle-repose.md) each once per day as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
