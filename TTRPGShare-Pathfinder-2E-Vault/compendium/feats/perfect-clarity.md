# Perfect Clarity  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 18*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Trigger** You fail or critically fail an attack roll or Will save.
- **Activity** Reaction

You burn out all of your rage to ensure that your attack lands and your mind remains free. Reroll the triggering attack roll or Will save with a +2 circumstance bonus, use the better result, and resolve the effect. You then immediately stop raging.
