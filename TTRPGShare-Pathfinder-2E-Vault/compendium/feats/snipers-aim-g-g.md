# Sniper's Aim  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the sniper
- **Activity** Two-Action

You take an extra moment to carefully sync your aim and breathing, then fire a shot with great accuracy. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md)'s attack roll and ignore the target's concealment. If you're using a kickback firearm, you don't take the normal circumstance penalty on this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) for not having the required Strength score or firing without using a stabilizer.
