# Unbalancing Finisher  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[finisher](../../rules/traits/finisher-apg.md)  [swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You attack with a flashy assault that leaves your target off balance. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and deal damage, the target is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of your next turn.
