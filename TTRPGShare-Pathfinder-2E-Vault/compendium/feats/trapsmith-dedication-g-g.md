# Trapsmith Dedication  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Snarecrafter Dedication](snarecrafter-dedication-apg.md) or [Snare Specialist](snare-specialist.md) ranger class feat

You use glimmering gears and gnashing mechanisms to manufacture snares using specialized parts. Your snares include clockwork and steam-powered cogwheels and gears, and their gush of steam can hinder those you ensnare. If you choose to construct a snare using gears and a creature fails their saving throw against the snare, all creatures are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to that creature for 1 round, as a burst of steam obscures its vision.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter or trapsmith archetypes.

## Trapsmith Dedication leads to...
