# Speak With Kindred  *Feat 5*  
[leshy](../../rules/traits/leshy-b1.md)  


You have a connection with creatures that share your physiology.

You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) skill with plants or fungi that match your leshy heritage. Generally, fungus leshies can speak to mushrooms and fungi; gourd leshies can speak to gourds, melons, and similar fruiting plants; leaf leshies can speak with deciduous trees; and vine leshies can speak with vines and climbing plants. The GM determines which plants or fungi count for this ability.
