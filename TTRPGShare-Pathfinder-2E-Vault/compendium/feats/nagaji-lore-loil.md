# Nagaji Lore  *Feat 1*  
[nagaji](../../rules/traits/nagaji-loil.md)  


You're the vassal or apprentice of a learned naga, and you've studied the secrets of naga magic and concocting intricate poisons. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) and [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in your choice of [Nagaji Lore](../skills.md#Lore) or [Naga Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
