# Eschew Materials  *Feat 1*  
[wizard](../../rules/traits/wizard.md)  


You can use clever workarounds to replicate the arcane essence of certain materials. When [Casting a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that requires material components, you can provide these material components without a spell component pouch by drawing intricate replacement sigils in the air. Unlike when providing somatic components, you still must have a hand completely free. This doesn't remove the need for any materials listed in the spell's cost entry.
