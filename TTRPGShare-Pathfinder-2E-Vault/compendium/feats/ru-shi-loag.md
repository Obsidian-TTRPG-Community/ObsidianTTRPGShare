# Ru-shi  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](../../rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


You were born to a jiang-shi, one of the so-called hopping vampires found most often in Tian-Xia. Your parent had a supernatural obsession with counting small objects, which manifests in you as a preternatural gift for linguistics and mathematics. You are trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society) and gain the [Eye for Numbers](eye-for-numbers-apg.md) skill feat. If you would automatically become trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

## Ru-shi leads to...
