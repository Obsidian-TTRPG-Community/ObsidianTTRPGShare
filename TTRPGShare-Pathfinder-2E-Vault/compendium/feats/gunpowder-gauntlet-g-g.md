[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded one-handed firearm.
- **Activity** Single Action

Your flair keeps foes' attention, as your motions with your gun draw your foes into a deadly game. As you toy with them and performatively brandish your weapon, you build their tunnel vision, leaving them trapped in a perceptual gauntlet of your own making. Attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check against the Will DC of a single target within your one-handed firearm's first range increment.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes a –2 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.
> - **Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.
