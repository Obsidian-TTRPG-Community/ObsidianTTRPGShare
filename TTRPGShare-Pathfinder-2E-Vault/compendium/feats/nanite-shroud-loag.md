# Nanite Shroud  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[android](../../rules/traits/android-loag.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your nanites fly out of your body, swarming around you in a cloud. You become [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) for a number of rounds equal to half your level. You can't use this concealment to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md), as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious. While Nanite Shroud is active, you can't use other abilities that require the use of your nanites.
