# Impossible Gossip  *Feat 13*  
[poppet](../../rules/traits/poppet-lotgb.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You can speak to inanimate objects, finding a magical spark within them similar to the one that animated you. You can cast [stone tell](../spells/stone-tell.md) once per day as an arcane innate spell, but instead of speaking with natural or worked stone, you speak with toys, statues, or other three-dimensional inanimate objects crafted to mimic a creature's appearance, regardless of their composition. The GM has discretion over which objects you can speak with and what they know, although objects generally have a good opinion of those who have cared for them and a poor opinion of those who have neglected or ignored them.
