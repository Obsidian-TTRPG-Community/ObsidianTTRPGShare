# Poisoner's Twist  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Poisoner Dedication](poisoner-dedication-apg.md), trained in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that dealt damage against a target that is afflicted by a poison, and you know which poison.
- **Activity** Single Action

Poisons attack specific parts of the body—one venom might target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take advantage of such weaknesses. You deal `1d6` damage of the required [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage type and `1d6` poison damage to the target. If you're at least 18th level, you deal `2d6` damage of each type.
