# Lie To Me  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)

You can use [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) to weave traps to trip up anyone trying to deceive you. If you can engage in conversation with someone trying to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) to you, use your [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) DC if it is higher than your [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC to determine whether they succeed. This doesn't apply if you don't have a back-and-forth dialogue, such as when someone attempts to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) during a long speech.
