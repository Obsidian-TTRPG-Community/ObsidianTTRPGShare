# Boost Modulation  *Feat 12*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9

You aren't satisfied with keeping to just one kind of boost from your constant tinkering, so you've learned to modulate between several possibilities at once. Choose two additional offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9||offensive boosts (page 22). You can use an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to change the offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9|offensive boosts currently affecting your weapon, choosing between the one you chose for the class feature and the two you chose for this modification. If your weapon has the [modular](../../rules/traits/modular-logm.md) trait, you can swap the offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9|offensive boosts as part of the [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action you take to use that trait.
