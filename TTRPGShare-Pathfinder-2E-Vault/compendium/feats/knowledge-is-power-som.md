# Knowledge Is Power  *Feat 6*  
[magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  


When you critically succeed at a [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check about a creature, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against the creature, to your AC against its next attack roll, and to your save against its next effect requiring a save. If you share this information with your allies, they gain the benefits as well. If not used, these bonuses end after 1 minute.
