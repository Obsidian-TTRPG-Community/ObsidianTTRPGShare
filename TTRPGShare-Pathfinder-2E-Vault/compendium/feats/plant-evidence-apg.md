# Plant Evidence  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pickpocket](pickpocket.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You can put a single item you're holding of light or negligible Bulk onto a person without them noticing by succeeding at a [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check against their [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC. If you have the ruffian racket, you can do this as a free action when you successfully [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) a target.
