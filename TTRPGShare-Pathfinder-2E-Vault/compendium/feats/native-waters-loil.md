# Native Waters  *Feat 1*  
[undine](../../rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  


You were born with or obtained a special connection to either fresh water or salt water. Once made, this decision can't be changed. Whenever you take your full rest in a natural body of water of the type corresponding to your connection, you recover additional Hit Points equal to your level, and if you have the [doomed](../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) or [fatigued](../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) conditions, you reduce them by 2 instead of 1.
