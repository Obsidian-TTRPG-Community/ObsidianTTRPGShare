# Meteoric Spellstrike  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md), starlit span hybrid study
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a ranged or thrown weapon, or have a ranged unarmed attack.
- **Activity** Two-Action

A trail of energy flows from your target back to you. Make a [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) with a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack against a target within the ranged weapon or unarmed attack's first range increment. The spell you cast for the [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) can't be a cantrip or focus spell. Each creature in a line between you and the target, excluding you and the targer, takes damage equal to double the spell's level.

Determine the damage type as described in [Arcane Cascade](../../rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md).
