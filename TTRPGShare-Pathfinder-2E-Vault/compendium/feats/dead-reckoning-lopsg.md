# Dead Reckoning  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md), trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've trained yourself to maintain a strong sense of direction at all times, even when you can't use a compass or see the sky above. You immediately intuit which direction is north (assuming the concept of north exists at your current location).
