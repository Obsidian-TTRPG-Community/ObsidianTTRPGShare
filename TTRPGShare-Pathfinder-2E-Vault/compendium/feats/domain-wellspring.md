# Domain Wellspring  *Feat 18*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Domain Focus](domain-focus.md)

The intensity of your focus grows from the investment you've placed in your domains. If you have spent at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you [Refocused](../../rules/actions/refocus.md), you recover 3 Focus Points when you [Refocus](../../rules/actions/refocus.md) instead of 1.
