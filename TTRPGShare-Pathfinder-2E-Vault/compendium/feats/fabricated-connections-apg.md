# Fabricated Connections  *Feat 7*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dandy Dedication](dandy-dedication-apg.md); master in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)

You can lie about having taken an action so convincingly that you acquire all the tangible benefits of having successfully completed it. You can roll [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) in place of a different skill when attempting to [Earn Income](../../rules/actions/earn-income.md), [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md), [Request](../../rules/actions/request.md), or [Subsist](../../rules/actions/subsist.md). You can use Fabricated Connections to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) or [Request](../../rules/actions/request.md) once per day, and you can also use it once per week to [Earn Income](../../rules/actions/earn-income.md) or [Subsist](../../rules/actions/subsist.md).
