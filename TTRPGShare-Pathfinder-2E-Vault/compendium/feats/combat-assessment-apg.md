# Combat Assessment  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You make a telegraphed attack to learn about your foe. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, you can immediately attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the target. On a critical hit, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). The target is temporarily immune to Combat Assessment for 1 day.
