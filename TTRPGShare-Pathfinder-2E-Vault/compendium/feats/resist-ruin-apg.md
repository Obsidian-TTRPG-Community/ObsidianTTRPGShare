# Resist Ruin  *Feat 13*  
[duskwalker](../../rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  


Your duskwalker heritage allows you to extend protection against negative energy to yourself or an ally in need. You gain resistance 5 to negative energy, and once per day, you can cast [death ward](../spells/death-ward.md) as a divine innate spell.
