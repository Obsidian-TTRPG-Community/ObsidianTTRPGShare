You become trained in all simple weapons. If you were already trained in all simple weapons, you become trained in all martial weapons. If you were already trained in all martial weapons, you become trained in one advanced weapon of your choice.

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you do, you become trained in additional weapons as appropriate, following the above progression.
