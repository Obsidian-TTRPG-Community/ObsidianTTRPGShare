# Mauler Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Strength 14

You specialize in weapons that require two hands. You become trained in all simple and martial melee weapons that require two hands to wield or have the [two-hand](../../rules/traits/two-hand.md) trait. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in these weapons. If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the mauler archetype.
