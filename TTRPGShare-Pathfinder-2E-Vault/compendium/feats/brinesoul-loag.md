# Brinesoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [undine](../../rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  


Your elemental ancestor's legacy asserts itself as brackish water, like the seawater of the ocean. You gain the Salt Wound reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Salt Wound [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[undine](../../../rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature that has blood and is not at its maximum Hit Points hits you with a melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md)

**Effect** You channel salt and brine from your blood into the creature's wounds. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the creature takes `1d6` [persistent acid damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) by the pain. On a critical failure, it instead takes `2d6` [persistent acid damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
