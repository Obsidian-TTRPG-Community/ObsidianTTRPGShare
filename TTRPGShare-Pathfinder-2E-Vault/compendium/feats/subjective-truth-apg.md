# Subjective Truth  *Feat 7*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), [Vigilante Dedication](vigilante-dedication-apg.md)

Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point of view of your current identity, you can say it even under effects like [zone of truth](../spells/zone-of-truth.md) that force you to speak the truth.
