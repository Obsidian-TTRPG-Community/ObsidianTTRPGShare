# Deimatic Display  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Single Action

Imitating animal threat displays, you make yourself appear larger and more imposing. Roll one [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) and compare the result to the Will DC of each animal, fungus, and plant creature in a 15-foot cone. When you do, [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) gains the [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. You don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.
