[goblin](../../rules/traits/goblin.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You sing annoying goblin songs, distracting your foes with silly and repetitive lyrics. Attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check against the Will DC of a single enemy within 30 feet. This has all the usual traits and restrictions of a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check. You can affect up to two targets within range if you have expert proficiency in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance), four if you have master proficiency, and eight if you have legendary proficiency.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks and Will saves for 1 minute.
> - **Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks and Will saves for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is temporarily immune to attempts to use Goblin Song for 1 hour.
