# Expert Disassembly  *Feat 7*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), [Scrounger Dedication](scrounger-dedication-apg.md)

You can apply the same techniques you use to reverse engineer objects to disable them. You can use [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) instead of [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) to [Disable a Device](../../rules/actions/disable-a-device.md) or [Pick a Lock](../../rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md).
