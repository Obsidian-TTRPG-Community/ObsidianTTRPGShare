# Warden's Focus  *Feat 12*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: warden spells

Your connection with your surroundings grows deeper as you focus. If you have spent at least 2 Focus Points since the last time you [Refocused](../../rules/actions/refocus.md), you recover 2 Focus Points when you [Refocus](../../rules/actions/refocus.md) instead of 1.
