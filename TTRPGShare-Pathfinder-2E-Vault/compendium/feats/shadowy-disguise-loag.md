# Shadowy Disguise  *Feat 5*  
[fetchling](../../rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md)  


You wrap yourself in shadow to change your appearance. You can cast [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md) as a 1st-level occult innate spell once per day. This spell gains the [shadow](../../rules/traits/shadow.md) trait.
