# Ricochet Feint  *Feat 12*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ricochet Stance](ricochet-stance-rogue-apg.md)

While in Ricochet Stance, you can bounce a thrown weapon off a foe to distract them. You can attempt a [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md) against a creature within the first range increment of a thrown weapon you are wielding, rather than only creatures within your melee reach.
