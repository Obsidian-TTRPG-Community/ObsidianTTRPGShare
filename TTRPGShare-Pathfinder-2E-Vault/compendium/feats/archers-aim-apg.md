# Archer's Aim  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archer Dedication](archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You slow down, focus, and take a careful shot. Make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a weapon in the bow weapon group.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition. If the target is [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden), reduce the flat check from being [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from 11 to 5.
