# Spark Of Independence  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[poppet](../../rules/traits/poppet-lotgb.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You touch a creature with the [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md) trait and share the heightened sense of autonomy you've discovered. The minion is [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 round and is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. It can use this extra action to [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md), [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), or [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
