# Winding Flow  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Activity** Single Action

Any journey consists of more than simply reaching your destination. You use two of the following actions in any order: [Stand](../../rules/actions/stand.md), [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md), and [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md). You can't use the same action twice.
