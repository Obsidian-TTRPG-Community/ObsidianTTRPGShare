# Blank Slate  *Feat 16*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)

Your deceptions confound even the most powerful mortal divinations. [Detection](../../rules/traits/detection.md), [revelation](../../rules/traits/revelation.md), and [scrying](../../rules/traits/scrying.md) effects pass right over you, your possessions, and your auras, detecting nothing unless the detecting effect has a counteract level of 10 or higher. For example, [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md) would still detect other magic in the area but not any magic on you, [true seeing](../spells/true-seeing.md) wouldn't reveal you, [locate](../spells/locate.md) or [scrying](../spells/scrying.md) wouldn't find you, and so on.
