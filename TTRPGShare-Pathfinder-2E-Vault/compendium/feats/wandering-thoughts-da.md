[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [psyche](../../rules/traits/psyche-da.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  [teleportation](../../rules/traits/teleportation.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You used your most recent action to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

When your [Psyche is Unleashed](../../rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md), each burst of magic you cast also folds space around you, and you travel through one of those folds. You teleport 15 feet to a square you can see.
