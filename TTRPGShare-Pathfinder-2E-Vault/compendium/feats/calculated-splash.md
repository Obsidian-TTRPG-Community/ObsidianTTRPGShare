# Calculated Splash  *Feat 4*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb's splash. When you throw an alchemical bomb with the [splash](../../rules/traits/splash.md) trait, you can cause the bomb to deal splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.

## Calculated Splash leads to...

[Expanded Splash](expanded-splash.md), [Mega Bomb](mega-bomb.md), [Controlled Blast](controlled-blast-g-g.md)
