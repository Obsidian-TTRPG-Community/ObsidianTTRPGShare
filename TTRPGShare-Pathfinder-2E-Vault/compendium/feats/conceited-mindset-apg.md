# Conceited Mindset  *Feat 2*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil

Because you know your mind is superior, you scoff at anyone who would alter your mental state—but this hubris gets the better of you when you're wrong. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects. If you succeed at a save against a [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect, you critically succeed instead; similarly, if you fail at a save against a [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect, you critically fail instead.
