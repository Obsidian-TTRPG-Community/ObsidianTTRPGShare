# Twitchy  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](../../rules/traits/goblin.md)  


You are naturally suspicious and wary of danger, especially when you suspect someone might be leading you into an ambush. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saves against hazards, and to all of your initiative rolls. If at least one of your opponents is using [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) to determine their initiative, your bonus to initiative from this feat increases to +4.
