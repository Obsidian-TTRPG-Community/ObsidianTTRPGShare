# Forgotten Presence  *Feat 8*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


The world conspires to keep you forgotten and [unnoticed](../../rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed)— memories cloud, ink stains out your name in ledgers, and portraits of you crack and warp over your face. Characters attempting to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about you take a –2 circumstance penalty.

Add [modify memory](../spells/modify-memory.md) to your spell list as a primal spell.
