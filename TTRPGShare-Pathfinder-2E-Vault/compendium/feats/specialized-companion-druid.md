# Specialized Companion (Druid)  *Feat 14*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Incredible Companion

Your animal companion continues to grow in power and ability, and it is now cunning enough to become specialized. Your animal companion gains one specialization of your choice. (See the Animal Companion section on page 214.)

**Special.** You can select this feat up to three times. Each time, add a different specialization to your companion.
