[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

By observing an opponent, you can get a sense of their next move and prepare to counter or resist it. Choose one target and attempt a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check to [Sense Motive](../../rules/actions/sense-motive.md) against the foe's [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) DC or a hard DC of the foe's level, whichever is higher.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You precisely discern the target's strategy, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the creature until the start of your next turn and a +2 circumstance bonus to your next saving throw against the creature before the start of your next turn.
> - **Success** You deduce the gist of the target's strategy; as critical success, except the circumstance bonus is only +1.
> - **Failure** You fail to discern the target's strategy and gain no benefit.
> - **Critical Failure** You misinterpret the target's strategy and take a –1 circumstance penalty to AC against the creature until the start of your next turn, and a –1 circumstance penalty to your next saving throw against the creature before the start of your next turn.
