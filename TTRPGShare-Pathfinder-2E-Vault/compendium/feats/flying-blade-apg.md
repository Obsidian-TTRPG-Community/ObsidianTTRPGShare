# Flying Blade  *Feat 1*  
[swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: precise strike

You've learned to apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as melee attacks. When you have panache, you apply your precise strike damage on ranged [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) you make with a [thrown](../../rules/traits/thrown.md) weapon within that weapon's first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) or [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md) weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) for [Confident Finisher](../../rules/actions/confident-finisher-apg.md) and any other finisher that includes a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that can benefit from your precise strike.
