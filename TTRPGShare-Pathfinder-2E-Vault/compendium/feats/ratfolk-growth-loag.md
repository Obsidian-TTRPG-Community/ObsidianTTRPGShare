# Ratfolk Growth  *Feat 17*  
[ratfolk](../../rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md)  


You call upon the familial bonds you share with other ysoki to defend them in battle. You can cast [enlarge](../spells/enlarge.md) as a 6th-level primal innate spell once per day. You can target only yourself and other ratfolk with this spell.
