# Chemical Purification  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[additive <2>](../../rules/traits/additive.md)  [alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Trigger** You use [Quick Alchemy](../../rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) to craft an alchemist's fire or ghost charge, and that bomb's level is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

You developed a method to chemically purify and consecrate your bombs on the fly.

You include this additive mixture when crafting your alchemist's fire or ghost charge.

The created bomb deals `1d4` [persistent positive damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) in addition to whatever damage it would normally cause. As usual for positive damage, this damage harms only undead and creatures with [negative healing](../../rules/abilities/negative-healing-b2.md).
