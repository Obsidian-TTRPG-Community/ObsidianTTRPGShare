# Manipulative Charm  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Vampire Dedication, trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)

Against humanoids, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md), and to [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Gather Information](../../rules/actions/gather-information.md) and [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md).

Once per day, you can cast [charm](../spells/charm.md) as a divine innate spell using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) trait. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened by an additional level, to a maximum of a 9th-level [charm](../spells/charm.md) when you are 19th level.

## Manipulative Charm leads to...
