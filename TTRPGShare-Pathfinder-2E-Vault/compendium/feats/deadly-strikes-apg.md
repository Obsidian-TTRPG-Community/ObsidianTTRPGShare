# Deadly Strikes  *Feat 20*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  


You have honed your body to attack with lethal focus. Your unarmed attacks gain the deadly d10 trait, or you increase their [deadly](../../rules/traits/deadly.md) trait to `d10` if the unarmed attack is already deadly with a smaller die size.
