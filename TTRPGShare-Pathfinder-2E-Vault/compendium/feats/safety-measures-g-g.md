# Safety Measures  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Demolitionist Dedication](demolitionist-dedication-g-g.md)

You're often careful to be sure you're not hoisted on your own petard, or anyone else's, for that matter. When you have cover from a bomb, you gain resistance to damage caused by that bomb equal to half your level, plus a value equal to the circumstance bonus to AC granted by the cover. You gain these benefits against your own bombs regardless of whether you have cover.
