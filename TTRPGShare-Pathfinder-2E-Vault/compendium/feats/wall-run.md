[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You defy gravity, traversing vertical planes as easily as the ground. [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed. You must start your movement on a horizontal surface. During this movement, you can run up vertical surfaces, like walls, at your full Speed. If you end the [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) off the ground, you fall after taking your next action or when your turn ends, whichever comes first (though you can [Grab an Edge](../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md), if applicable). If you have [Water Step](water-step.md) or a similar ability, Wall Run lets you run along flimsy vertical surfaces, as well as vertical liquids, such as a waterfall.
