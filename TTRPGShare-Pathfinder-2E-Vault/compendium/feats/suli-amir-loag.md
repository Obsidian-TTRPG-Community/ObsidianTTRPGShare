# Suli Amir  *Feat 13*  
[suli](../../rules/traits/suli-b2.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You have power connected to the powerful jann amirs. You can cast [read omens](../spells/read-omens.md) and 4th-level [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.md) each once per day as arcane innate spells, and you can cast [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md) at will as an arcane innate cantrip, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
