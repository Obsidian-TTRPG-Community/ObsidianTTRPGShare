# Disruptive Stare  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [nagaji](../../rules/traits/nagaji-loil.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet attempts to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your frigid gaze can turn a foe's blood to ice. The triggering creature must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. It then becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** The triggering spell takes a –2 status penalty to its spell attack rolls and DCs.
> - **Critical Failure** The triggering spell is disrupted.
