# Enigma's Knowledge  *Feat 12*  
[bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Assured Knowledge](assured-knowledge-apg.md)

Your muse whispers knowledge to you at all the right times.

You gain the benefits of the [Automatic Knowledge](automatic-knowledge.md) skill feat with any skill you can use to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). As per the special clause in the Automatic Knowledge feat, you can still only use Automatic Knowledge once per round.
