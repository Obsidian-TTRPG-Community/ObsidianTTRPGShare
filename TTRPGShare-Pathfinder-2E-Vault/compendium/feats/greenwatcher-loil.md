# Greenwatcher  *Feat 10*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  [investigator](../../rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  [ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Defy Fey

Your experience fighting against and alongside fey creatures is nearly unrivaled.

Any weapon you wield or unarmed attack you make against a fey creature is treated as cold iron. Whenever you critically fail a save against a spell cast by a fey creature, it's instead treated as a normal failure. Whenever you critically succeed on a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a fey creature, the target is immediately subject to the effects of a [faerie fire](../spells/faerie-fire.md) spell. For the purposes of counteracting this effect, it's an innate 2nd-level primal spell.
