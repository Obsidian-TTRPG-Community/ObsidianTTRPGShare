# Speedy Rituals  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Efficient Rituals](efficient-rituals-apg.md)

You can perform rituals in only a fraction of the usual time. If a ritual has a casting time measured in days, you can cast it in an equal number of hours. If this results in a ritual longer than 8 hours, you split the ritual between multiple days, as normal for a ritual.
