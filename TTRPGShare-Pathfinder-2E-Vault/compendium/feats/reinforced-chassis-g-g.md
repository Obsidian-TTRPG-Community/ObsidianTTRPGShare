# Reinforced Chassis  *Feat 1*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  

- **Trigger** A critical hit deals physical damage to you.

Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your chassis is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a speed penalty of –5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. You can never wear other armor or remove your chassis; however, you still don't become fatigued from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armor runes onto your chassis as normal.

- **Trigger**: A critical hit deals physical damage to you

**Effect** Attempt a DC 17 flat check. If you are successful, the attack becomes a normal hit.
```

**Enhancement** Your chassis becomes difficult to overcome. You gain the Chassis Deflection reaction.
