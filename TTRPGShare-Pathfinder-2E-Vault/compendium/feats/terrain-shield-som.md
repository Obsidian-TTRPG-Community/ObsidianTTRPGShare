# Terrain Shield  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Geomancer Dedication](geomancer-dedication-som.md), master in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** A [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) would damage you.
- **Requirements**: You gained a terrain attunement benefit since the start of your most recent turn and that attunement matches the terrain you're in.

You're so attuned to the land that it rises up to protect you from a potentially fatal blow in a seeming coincidence. For instance, a branch suddenly falls from a nearby tree to take the brunt of a sword swing or a surprising change of current disrupts an enemy's attack. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to double your level against the triggering [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
