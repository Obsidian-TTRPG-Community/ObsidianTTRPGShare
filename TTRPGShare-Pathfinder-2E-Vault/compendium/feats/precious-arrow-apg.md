# Precious Arrow  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Archer Dedication](eldritch-archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enchant a piece of ammunition with the magical essence of a precious material, allowing you to leverage certain creatures' weaknesses. Choose cold iron or silver; if you shoot the arrow before the end of your turn, it counts as that material. At 14th level, add adamantine to the list of materials you can choose from.
