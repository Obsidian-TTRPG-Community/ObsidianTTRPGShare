# Barreling Charge (Fighter)  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You rush forward, moving enemies aside to reach your foe.

You [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), attempting to move through your enemies' spaces, and make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). Roll an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check and compare the result to the Fortitude DC of each creature whose space you attempt to move through during your [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), moving through their space on a success but ending your movement before entering their space on a failure. You can use Barreling Charge to [Burrow](../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
