# Cascading Ray  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)  [magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md), and the spell you cast dealt energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, or sonic).
- **Activity** Single Action

Magical energy spills out to extend beyond the creature you struck. The flowing energy forms a ray with a range of 60 feet from the creature you damaged. You can't target any of the creatures you damaged with your [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) with the ray. Make a spell attack roll against the new target's AC, at the same multiple attack penalty as the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, the target of the ray takes `1d4` damage per spell level of the same type of energy damage the spell deals (double damage on a critical hit). If you cast the spell in your [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) from a spell slot, the damage from Cascading Ray increases to `1d8` damage per spell level.

If the spell deals more than one type of energy damage, you choose only one for the ray. This ray has the [attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md) trait, the school and tradition traits of the original spell, and the trait matching the damage type.
