# Stumbling Feint  *Feat 6*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), [Stumbling Stance](stumbling-stance-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Stumbling Stance.

You lash out confusingly with what seems to be a weak move but instead allows you to unleash a dangerous flurry of blows upon your unsuspecting foe. When you use [Flurry of Blows](../../rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md), you can attempt a check to [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md) as a free action just before the first [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). On a success, instead of making the target [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your next attack, they become [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against both attacks from the [Flurry of Blows](../../rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md).
