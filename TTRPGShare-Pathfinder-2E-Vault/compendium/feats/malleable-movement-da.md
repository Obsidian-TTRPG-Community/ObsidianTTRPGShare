# Malleable Movement  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mind Smith Dedication](mind-smith-dedication-da.md), expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)
- **Trigger** You [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

You shift the shape of your weapon to help you [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) farther and faster. You shift your weapon into a long flexible pole, climbing hook, or similar aid, adding an extra 5 feet to the distance you're able to [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md). As normal, this can't increase the distance of your [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) beyond your Speed.
