# Attack Of Opportunity (Champion)  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity** Reaction

You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
