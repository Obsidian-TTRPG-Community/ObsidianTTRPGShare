# Mirror-Risen  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [reflection](../../rules/traits/reflection-da.md)  


You were created from magic involving mirrors and still retain some ability to seek refuge in reflected illusions. You gain the Mirror's Trickery reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Mirror's Trickery [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Trigger**: You would be hit by a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md)

**Effect** You create an illusory duplicate at the last instant and attempt to trick your foe into striking it instead of you. The attacker attempts a DC 11 flat check; on a failure, the attack hits the duplicate, changing the result from a critical success to a success or a success to a failure.
