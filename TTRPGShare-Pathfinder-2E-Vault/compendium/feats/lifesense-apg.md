# Lifesense  *Feat 5*  
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [duskwalker](../../rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  


You have a limited ability to sense life force, like your psychopomp forebears. You gain [lifesense](../../rules/abilities/lifesense.md) as an imprecise sense with a range of 10 feet. This allows you to sense the life force within living creatures and its counterforce that animates the undead, though you can't distinguish between the two.
