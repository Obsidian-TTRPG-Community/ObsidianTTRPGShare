You don't take the normal –2 penalty to attack rolls with improvised weapons. Additionally, whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with any weapon, you also gain that proficiency with improvised weapons.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the weapon improviser archetype.
