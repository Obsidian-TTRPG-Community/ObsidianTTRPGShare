# Flinging Blow  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 16*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You take a moment to center yourself, then unleash a powerful blow that sends your target tumbling away. Make an unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from you (or 20 feet, on a critical failure) and fall [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). If another creature or physical object would prevent this movement, both your target and the blocking creature or object take `1d6` bludgeoning damage per 5 feet of movement that was prevented.
