# Train Animal  *Feat 1*  
[downtime](../../rules/traits/downtime.md)  [general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)

You spend time teaching an animal to do a certain action. You can either select a basic action the animal already knows how to do (typically those listed in the [Command an Animal](../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) action) or attempt to teach the animal a new basic action. The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time the training takes (usually at least a week). It's usually impossible to teach an animal a trick that uses critical thinking. If you're expert, master, or legendary in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), you might be able to train more unusual creatures, at the GM's discretion.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The animal learns the action. If it was an action the animal already knew, you can Command the Animal to take that action without attempting a [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) check. If it was a new basic action, add that action to the actions the animal can take when Commanded, but you must still roll.
> - **Failure** The animal doesn't learn the trick.
