[grippli](../../rules/traits/grippli-b2.md)  


Escaping your nets is no simple task. The [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) DC to [Force Open](../../rules/actions/force-open.md) or [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) your nets increases from 16 to 18. After a creature you [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) with a net [Escapes](../../rules/actions/escape.md) or Forces Open the net, stray strands of the net cling to the creature, causing them to remain [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the beginning of their next turn.
