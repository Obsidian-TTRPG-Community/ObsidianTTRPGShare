# Healer's Halo  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Halo](halo-apg.md)
- **Trigger** You or allies within 30 feet recover Hit Points while your halo is active.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your halo can enhance positive energy. Creatures who have recovered Hit Points from a positive [healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md) effect recover an additional `1d6` Hit Points. Creatures who benefit from this power become temporarily immune to its effect for the next 10 minutes.
