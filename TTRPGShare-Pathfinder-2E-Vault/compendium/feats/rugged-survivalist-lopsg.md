# Rugged Survivalist  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](swordmaster-dedication-locg.md), master in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)

Swordmaster Feats The following archetype feats are available to characters with the swordmaster archetype (Character Guide 115)

You've studied survival skills with the School of Swords experts and are comfortable spending long periods of time in the wilderness. You don't get [fatigued](../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) more quickly due to precipitation during overland travel, though you can otherwise be [fatigued](../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) as normal. You can go 3 days + your Constitution modifier without water before you take damage from thirst and you can go 5 days + your Constitution modifier without food before you take damage from starvation (Core Rulebook 500).
