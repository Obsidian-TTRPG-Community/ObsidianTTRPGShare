# Dream Magic  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sleepwalker Dedication](sleepwalker-dedication-da.md)

You learn dream-related magic to aid your studies. Choose dream message or sleep upon taking this feat; you learn this spell as a 4th-level innate occult spell. If you choose sleep, you can cast the spell only while in a Daydream Trance. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.

**Special.** You can take this feat twice, gaining the spell you didn't select initially the second time.
