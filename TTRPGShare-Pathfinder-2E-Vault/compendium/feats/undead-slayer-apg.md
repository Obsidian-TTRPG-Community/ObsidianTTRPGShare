# Undead Slayer  *Feat 5*  
[dhampir](../../rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md)  


Your knowledge of your own not-quite-living anatomy, combined with your experience in combat, helps you take down undead foes with ease. Against undead creatures, you gain a circumstance bonus to damage with weapons and unarmed attacks equal to the number of weapon damage dice for the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). This bonus increases to double the number of weapon damage dice if your target has the [vampire](../../rules/traits/vampire-b1.md) trait.
