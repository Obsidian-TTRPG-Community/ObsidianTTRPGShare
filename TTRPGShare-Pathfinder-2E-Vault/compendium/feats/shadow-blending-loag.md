[fetchling](../../rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md)  [illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [shadow](../../rules/traits/shadow.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature attempts a flat check to target you while you're [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) due to dim light or darkness.
- **Activity** Reaction

You draw shadows close to create a shroud. Increase the DC of the flat check by 2.
