# Mixed Maneuver  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You combine two different maneuvers together into a single flowing whole. Choose any two of [Grapple](../../rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md), and [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md). Attempt both of the attacks you chose against the same or different creatures, but don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after resolving both attacks.
