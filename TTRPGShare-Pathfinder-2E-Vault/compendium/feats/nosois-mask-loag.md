# Nosoi's Mask  *Feat 1*  
[duskwalker](../../rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

Many psychopomps wear masks when dealing with the living, and many cultures believe that seeing an unmasked psychopomp's face invites death. You are trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) and gain the [Intimidating Glare](intimidating-glare.md) skill feat. If you were already trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also know how to make masks like those worn by psychopomps, a process that takes 1 hour and 1 sp of appropriate material. If you instead pay 50 gp for a splendid psychopomp mask, the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) while you are wearing it. Its usage is worn (mask).
