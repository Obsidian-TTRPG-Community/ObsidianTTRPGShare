# Mist Escape  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Coffin Bound](coffin-bound-botd.md), [Turn to Mist](turn-to-mist-botd.md)
- **Trigger** You are reduced to 0 HP.
- **Activity** Free Action

As you fall, your body reacts to defend itself. You [Turn to Mist](turn-to-mist-botd.md). This doesn't expend a use of Turn to Mist, and you can use Mist [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) even if you've already Turned to Mist in the same day. You take move actions to move directly toward your coffin even though you are at 0 HP, though you aren't conscious and don't have control over how you do so. While at 0 HP in this form, you are unaffected by further damage. You automatically return to your corporeal form, [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), if you reach your coffin or after 1 hour when you are destroyed, whichever one comes first.
