# Radiant Infusion  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: good alignment, healing font
- **Activity** Single Action

You pour invigorating positive energy into a living ally. If the next action you use is to cast [heal](../spells/heal.md) to restore Hit Points to a single living creature, the target deals an additional `1d6` positive damage with its melee weapons and unarmed attacks until the end of its next turn. If the [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell is at least 5th level, this damage increases to `2d6`, or `3d6` if the spell is at least 8th level.
