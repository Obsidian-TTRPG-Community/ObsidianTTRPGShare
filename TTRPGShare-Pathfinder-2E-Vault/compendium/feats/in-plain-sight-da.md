# In Plain Sight  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

People often only see what they want to see, a weakness you know how to take full advantage of. While you've Assumed a Role, you can use [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) in place of [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) when using the [Avoid Notice](../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) exploration activity in an area where someone with your role wouldn't be unusual, such as when impersonating a sailor or fisher when infiltrating the docks.
