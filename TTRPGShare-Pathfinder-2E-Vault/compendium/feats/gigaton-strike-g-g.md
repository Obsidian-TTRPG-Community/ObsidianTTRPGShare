# Gigaton Strike  *Feat 8*  
[inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Megaton Strike](megaton-strike-g-g.md)

When you use a full-power [Megaton Strike](megaton-strike-g-g.md), you can knock your foe back. When you succeed at your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) while using an unstable [Megaton Strike](megaton-strike-g-g.md), your target must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is pushed back 5 feet.
> - **Failure** The creature is pushed back 10 feet.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pushed back 20 feet.

**Special.** If your innovation is a minion, this benefit applies on its unstable [Megaton Strikes](megaton-strike-g-g.md).
