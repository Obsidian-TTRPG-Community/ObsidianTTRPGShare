# Exploit Opening  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Trigger** Your spotter critically succeeds at a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature, and that creature is within your ranged weapon's first range increment.
- **Activity** Reaction

You take advantage of your spotter's devastating attack to unleash your own follow-up attack. Make a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a –2 penalty against the target of the triggering attack.

This [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
