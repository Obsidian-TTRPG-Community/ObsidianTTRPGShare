# Demon's Hair  *Feat 20*  
[uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [witch](../../rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Living Hair](living-hair-apg.md)

Your hair constantly wriggles and writhes like that of your rival, Syu Tak-nwa. Your damage die of your hair unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) increases by one step and it gains the reach and versatile slashing traits. Your familiar assumes partial control over your hair; as long as your familiar is alive and within 30 feet, you are permanently [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened), and you can use the extra action only to make a hair [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).

You can deliver hexes through your hair. When you successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a hair [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against them before applying [any](../../rules/traits/any-b1.md) effects of the hex. If this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) misses, the hex has no effect.

**Special.** If your hair already has the [reach](../../rules/traits/reach.md) trait, it instead gains the [sweep](../../rules/traits/sweep.md) trait.
