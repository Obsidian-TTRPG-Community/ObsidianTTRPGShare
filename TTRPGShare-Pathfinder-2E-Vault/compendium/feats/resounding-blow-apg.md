# Resounding Blow  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You strike your enemy in the head with such force that their ears ring. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits and deals damage, the target is [deafened](../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) until the start of your next turn (or for 1 minute on a critical hit).
