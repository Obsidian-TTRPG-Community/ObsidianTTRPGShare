# Disengaging Twist  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wrestler Dedication](wrestler-dedication-lotgb.md)
- **Trigger** A creature gives you the [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your ability to twist your opponents' bodies into painful locks and holds makes you particularly adept at escaping such predicaments. Attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) the triggering condition. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check.
