# One-inch Punch  [V](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies") *Feat 6*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert strikes
- **Activity** Varies ([>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") OR [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action"))

You put all your force into a single mighty, carefully controlled blow. Make an unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you spend two actions and this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. You can instead spend 3 actions to perform an even more powerful attack, dealing a second additional die of weapon damage on a hit.

If you're at least 10th level, the number of additional dice you add from this feat doubles, for a total of 2 additional dice if you spend 2 actions or 4 additional dice if you spend 3 actions. If you're at least 18th level, the number of additional dice you add from this feat triples, for a total of 3 additional dice if you spend 2 actions or 6 additional dice if you spend 3 actions.
