# Wolf Stance  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged teeth. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md), [backstabber](../../rules/traits/backstabber.md), [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md), [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

If you're flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the [trip](../../rules/traits/trip.md) trait.

## Wolf Stance leads to...

[Wolf Drag](wolf-drag.md)
