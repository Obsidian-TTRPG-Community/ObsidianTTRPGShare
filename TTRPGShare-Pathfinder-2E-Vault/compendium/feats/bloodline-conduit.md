# Bloodline Conduit  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 20*  
[metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

Your inborn magical nature lets you redirect ambient energies to fuel your spells. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don't expend the spell's slot when you cast it.
