# Acrobatic Performer  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics)

You're an incredible acrobat, evoking wonder and enrapturing audiences with your prowess. It's almost a performance! You can roll an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check instead of a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check when using the [Perform](../../rules/actions/perform.md) action.
