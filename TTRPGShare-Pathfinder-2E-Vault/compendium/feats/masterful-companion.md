# Masterful Companion  *Feat 18*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: masterful hunter, Animal Companion

Your animal companion shares your incredible hunting skills, allowing it to take down your shared prey with ease. When you [Hunt Prey](../../rules/actions/hunt-prey.md), your animal companion gains the masterful hunter benefit associated with your hunter's edge, rather than just your original hunter's edge benefit.
