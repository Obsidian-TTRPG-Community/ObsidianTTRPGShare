# Continual Recovery  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)

You zealously monitor a patient's progress to administer treatment faster. When you [Treat Wounds](../../rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), your patient becomes immune for only 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. This applies only to your [Treat Wounds](../../rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) activities, not any other the patient receives.
