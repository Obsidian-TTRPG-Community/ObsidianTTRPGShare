[vishkanya](../../rules/traits/vishkanya-loil.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Two-Action

You move and attack with a swiftness that most can't follow. You [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) and then [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). Your movement doesn't trigger reactions based on movement.
