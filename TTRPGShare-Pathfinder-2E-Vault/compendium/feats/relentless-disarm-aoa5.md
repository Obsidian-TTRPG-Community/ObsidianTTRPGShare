# Relentless Disarm  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Zephyr Guard Dedication](zephyr-guard-dedication-aoa5.md), trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

When you succeed, but don't critically succeed, at a check to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) a creature, your circumstance bonus to further checks to [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) that creature is +4 instead of +2. Other creatures gain only the normal bonus.

When you critically succeed at a [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) check, you can immediately [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) your target as a reaction.
