# Improbable Elixirs  *Feat 18*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


Your mastery of alchemical secrets enables you to replicate effects most believe can be achieved only via magic. Select a number of potions equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) of 9th level or lower. You gain formulas to create these potions as alchemical items with the [elixir](../../rules/traits/elixir.md) trait. When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components, and you can use [alchemist's tools](../equipment/items/alchemists-tools.md) (for [Quick Alchemy](../../rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md)) or an [alchemist's lab](../equipment/items/alchemists-lab.md) (for the [Craft](../../rules/actions/craft.md) activity) instead of any other required tool kits. Other than that, the formula does not change. Once you've chosen the potion formulas, they can't be changed.
