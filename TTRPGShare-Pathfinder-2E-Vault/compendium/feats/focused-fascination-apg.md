# Focused Fascination  *Feat 1*  
[swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fascinating Performance](fascinating-performance.md)

When you use [Fascinating Performance](fascinating-performance.md) in a combat encounter, you need only a success, rather than a critical success, to fascinate your target. This works only if you're attempting to fascinate one target. For example, if you were an expert in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance), you could choose to target multiple creatures normally or target one creature and fascinate it on a success.
