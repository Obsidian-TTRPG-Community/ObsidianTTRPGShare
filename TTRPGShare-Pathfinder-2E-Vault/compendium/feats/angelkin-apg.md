# Angelkin  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](../../rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


You descend from an angel—a winged messenger from Nirvana or one of the other celestial realms—which gives you a knack for cultures and languages. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Society](../skills.md#Society). If you would automatically become trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You know the Celestial language, and you gain the [Multilingual](multilingual.md) skill feat.

## Angelkin leads to...

[Angelic Magic](angelic-magic-apg.md), [Truespeech](truespeech-loag.md)
