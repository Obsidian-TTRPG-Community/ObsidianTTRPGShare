# Quick Shield Block (Fighter)  *Feat 8*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Block](shield-block.md)

You can bring your shield into place with hardly a thought. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to [Shield Block](shield-block.md).
