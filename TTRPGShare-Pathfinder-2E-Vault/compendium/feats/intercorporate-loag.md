# Intercorporate  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[aphorite](../../rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: You're afflicted by a disease or poison, or are taking [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
- **Activity** Single Action

Your ordered physiology rejects unwelcome elements. Choose one.

**[Disease](../../rules/traits/disease.md) or [Poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md)** Attempt a saving throw against the affliction at its current stage. On a failure, the affliction's stage doesn't increase, but you suffer the effects of the stage you were already on. On a critical failure, the stage only increases by 1.

**[Persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage)** Attempt a DC 10 flat check to recover from the [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
