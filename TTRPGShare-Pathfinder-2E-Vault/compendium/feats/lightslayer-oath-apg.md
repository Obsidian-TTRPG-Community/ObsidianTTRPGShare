# Lightslayer Oath  *Feat 2*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [oath](../../rules/traits/oath.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil

You've sworn to rid the world of the self-righteousness of celestial beings. Add the following tenet to your code, after the other tenets. "You must banish or slay celestials you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the incredibly unlikely event you find an evil celestial, you don't have to banish or kill it." When you use your champion's reaction against a celestial, the extra damage you deal with [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) increases by 1 (or by 2 at 9th level and by 3 at 16th level).
