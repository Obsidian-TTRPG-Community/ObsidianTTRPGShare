- **Prerequisites**: [Shadow Magic](shadow-magic-apg.md)

You can focus the shadows into a powerful blast. You can cast [shadow blast](../spells/shadow-blast.md) as an innate occult spell once per day. Its level is always 1 level lower than the level of your shadowdancer focus spells. You become an expert in occult spell attack rolls and DCs.
