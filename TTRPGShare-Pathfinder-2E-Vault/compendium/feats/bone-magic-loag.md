# Bone Magic  *Feat 1*  
[lizardfolk](../../rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  


Your connection to your iruxi ancestors manifests as a simple primal spell that you cast using a fragment of an ancestor's bones. Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, and it's heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
