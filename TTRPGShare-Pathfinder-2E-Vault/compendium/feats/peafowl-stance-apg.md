# Peafowl Stance  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Monastic Weaponry](monastic-weaponry.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a sword that has the [monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md) trait in one hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a tall and proud stance while remaining mobile, with all the grace and composure of a peafowl. While in this stance, the only [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are melee [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the required sword. Once per round, after you hit with a monk sword [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), you can [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) as a free action as your next action.
