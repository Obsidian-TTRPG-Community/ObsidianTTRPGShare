# Elemental Trade  *Feat 1*  
[oread](../../rules/traits/oread-b2.md)  


You have a strong connection with stone and metal. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting). If you would automatically become trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](specialty-crafting.md) skill feat for both Stonemasonry and Blacksmithing.
