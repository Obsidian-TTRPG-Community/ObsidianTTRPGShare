# Primal Rampage  *Feat 13*  
[lizardfolk](../../rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  


You tap into the unstoppable, primeval strength of your ancient kin. You gain [freedom of movement](../spells/freedom-of-movement.md) and [stoneskin](../spells/stoneskin.md) as 4th-level primal innate spells that you can cast once per day. As a 3-action activity, you can [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) twice to cast both of these innate spells, as long as they are both still available for the day.
