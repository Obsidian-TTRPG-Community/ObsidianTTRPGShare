# Greater Interpose  *Feat 14*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sacrifice Armor](sacrifice-armor-apg.md)

Your divine grace empowers you to avoid hits when you otherwise could not. You can use Sacrifice Armor to reduce any type of damage from an attack or effect requiring a Reflex save.

When you use Sacrifice Armor against a critical hit or a critical failure on a Reflex save that would otherwise cause you to take double damage, you take the normal amount of damage instead.
