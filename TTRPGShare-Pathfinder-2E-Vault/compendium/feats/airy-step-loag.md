# Airy Step  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[sylph](../../rules/traits/sylph-b2.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack or other targeted effect, and you can see the attacker.
- **Activity** Reaction

You create a blanket of fog in a 5–foot burst centered on one corner of your space. All creatures within that area are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed), and all others are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to them. This concealment applies to the triggering effect, and the fog lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. After resolving the triggering effect, you [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md). If an effect prevents you from [Stepping](../../rules/actions/step.md), you attempt to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) the effect and [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) if you succeed.
