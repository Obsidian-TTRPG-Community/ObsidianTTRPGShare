# Crane Stance  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of a crane, holding your arms in an imitation of a crane's wings and using flowing, defensive motions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, but the only [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are crane wing attacks. These deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md), [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md), [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) and [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) by 5, and when you [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md), you can move an additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
