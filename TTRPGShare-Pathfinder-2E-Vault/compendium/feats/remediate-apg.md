# Remediate  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 16*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Free Action

If your next action is to use your divine font to cast a 3-action [heal](../spells/heal.md) or [harm](../spells/harm.md) spell to damage creatures, you can harness the residual energy to counterbalance opposing forces. You use your [heal](../spells/heal.md) or [harm](../spells/harm.md) spell to attempt to counteract one effect in the spell's area with the [chaotic](../../rules/traits/chaotic.md), [evil](../../rules/traits/evil.md), [good](../../rules/traits/good.md), or [lawful](../../rules/traits/lawful.md) trait. The chosen trait must oppose one component of your deity's alignment; if your deity is neutral, you can choose any one trait.
