# Thrown Voice  *Feat 5*  
[strix](../../rules/traits/strix-loag.md)  


You've learned how to throw your voice through the winds, tricking others as to your location. You can cast [ventriloquism](../spells/ventriloquism.md) as a primal innate spell once per day. If you're a songbird strix, you can cast it twice per day instead.
