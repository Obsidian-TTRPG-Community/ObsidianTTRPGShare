[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)

Your reports are thorough and informative, and putting your thoughts to paper helps you retain the information. Keep track of each type of creature you successfully identify with [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). When attempting [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) checks against creatures on your list in later encounters, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you learn an additional fact about such creatures on a success.

## Thorough Reports leads to...

[Discerning Strike](discerning-strike-lopsg.md)
