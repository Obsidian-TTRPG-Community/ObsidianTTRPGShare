# Moment Of Clarity  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You push back your rage for a moment in order to think clearly. Until the end of this turn, you can use actions with the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait even if those actions don't have the [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md) trait.
