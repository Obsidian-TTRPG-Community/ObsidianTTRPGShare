# Courageous Onslaught  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Courageous Advance](courageous-advance-apg.md), [Courageous Assault](courageous-assault-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You use your performance to orchestrate an onslaught against your enemies. If your next action is to cast the [inspire courage](../spells/inspire-courage.md) composition cantrip, one ally who gains a status bonus from the spell can immediately use a reaction to [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) and then make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
