# Knockback Strike  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You focus your strength into a blow powerful enough to push an enemy away from you. Make an unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit, attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) the target. This attack uses the same multiple attack penalty as your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
