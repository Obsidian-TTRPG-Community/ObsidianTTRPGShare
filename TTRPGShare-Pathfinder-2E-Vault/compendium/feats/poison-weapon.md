# Poison Weapon  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a piercing or slashing weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You apply a [poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md) to the required weapon; if you're not holding a poison and have a free hand, you can [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a poison as part of this action. If your next attack with that weapon before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, it applies the effects of the poison, provided that poison can be delivered by contact or injury. If you critically fail the attack roll, the poison is wasted as normal.

**Special.** During your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of simple injury poisons equal to your rogue level. These poisons deal `1d4` poison damage. Only you can apply these poisons properly, and they expire the next time you prepare.
