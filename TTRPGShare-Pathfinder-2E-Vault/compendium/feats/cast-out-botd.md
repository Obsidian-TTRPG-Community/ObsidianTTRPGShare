# Cast Out  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Exorcist Dedication](exorcist-dedication-botd.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You attempt to cast a malevolent entity out of the creature or object it's possessing. Roll a counteract check against the [possession](../../rules/traits/possession.md) effect; you must be within 30 feet of the possessed creature or object to do so. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up, and your counteract modifier is your [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) modifier, [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) modifier, or spell DC – 10, whichever is highest. If you succeed, the entity is driven out and can't attempt to possess that creature or object for 1 week. If you fail, the possessing creature is immune to your Cast Out for a year and a day.
