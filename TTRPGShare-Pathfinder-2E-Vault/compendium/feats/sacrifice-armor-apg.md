# Sacrifice Armor  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Trigger** You are hit by a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that deals physical damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

With divine awareness, you twist your body to lessen the impact of an attack. Reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to twice your armor's level. Your armor becomes [broken](../../rules/conditions.md#Broken), reducing its Hit Points to its [Broken](../../rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold. If your armor was already damaged, it is destroyed instead.
