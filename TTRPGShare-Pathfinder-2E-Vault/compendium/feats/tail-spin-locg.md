# Tail Spin  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[goblin](../../rules/traits/goblin.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tailed goblin heritage, [Hard Tail](hard-tail-locg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You excel at using your tail as a weapon to upend your foes.

Attempt a single [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) up to two adjacent creatures. If you roll a success against a target, you get a critical success against that target instead.
