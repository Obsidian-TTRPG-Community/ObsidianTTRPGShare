# Expanded Splash  *Feat 10*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Calculated Splash](calculated-splash.md)

The particularly volatile compounds that you brew into your bombs result in them creating especially large and powerful explosions. When you throw an [alchemical](../../rules/traits/alchemical.md) [bomb](../../rules/traits/bomb.md) and that bomb has the [splash](../../rules/traits/splash.md) trait, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the bomb's usual splash damage, and it deals splash damage to every creature within 10 feet of the target.

## Expanded Splash leads to...

[Mega Bomb](mega-bomb.md), [Controlled Blast](controlled-blast-g-g.md)
