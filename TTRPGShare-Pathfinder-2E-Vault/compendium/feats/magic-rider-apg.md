# Magic Rider  *Feat 17*  
[elf](../../rules/traits/elf.md)  


Your people used powerful magic to travel between distant worlds, and the remnants of that magic make such transportation easier for you. When you are the target of a [teleportation](../../rules/traits/teleportation.md) spell that transports more than one person, it can affect an additional person beyond the normal limit, chosen by the caster. Additionally, when you're the target of a [teleport](../spells/teleport.md) spell, you and the other targets arrive no farther than 1 mile off target, regardless of distance traveled.
