# Webslinger  [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 13*  
[anadi](../../rules/traits/anadi-lome.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your natural ability to create silken webs blends with your magical powers, allowing you to create impossibly large webs with great frequency. This has the effects of a 2nd-level [web](../spells/web.md) spell using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
