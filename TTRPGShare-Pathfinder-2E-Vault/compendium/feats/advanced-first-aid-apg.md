# Advanced First Aid  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)

You use your medical training to ameliorate sickness or assuage fears. When you use [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) to [Administer First Aid](../../rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md), instead of Stabilizing a character or Stopping Bleeding, you can reduce an ally's [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) or [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition by 2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical success. You can remove only one condition at a time. The DC for the [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) check is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition.
