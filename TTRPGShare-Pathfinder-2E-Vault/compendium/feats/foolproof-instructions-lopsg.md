# Foolproof Instructions  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scrollmaster Dedication](scrollmaster-dedication-locg.md)

You feel confident that you can explain your scrolls so well that even your allies can use them... hopefully. During your daily preparations, you can select a single scroll and instruct a single ally in its use. Until your next daily preparations, the ally can attempt to use the scroll with a single action that has the [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait. The ally rolls the skill corresponding to the spellcasting tradition. The GM determines the DC based on the scroll's level, possibly adjusted for the situation. If the spell has a spell attack bonus or a spell DC, use your level as the proficiency bonus and the highest of your ally's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** For the rest of the ally's turn, they can spend actions to [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).
> - **Failure** The ally misremembers your instructions and can't use the scroll this turn.
> - **Critical Failure** The ally misunderstood your instructions and can't use the scroll.
