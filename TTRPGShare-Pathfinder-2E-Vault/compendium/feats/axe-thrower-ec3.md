# Axe Thrower  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Turpin Rowe Lumberjack Dedication](turpin-rowe-lumberjack-dedication-ec3.md)

You have mastered the weight and balance of a variety of axes and can lob them with ease. Any one-handed axe weapon you wield has the [thrown](../../rules/traits/thrown.md) trait with a range of 10 feet. For axes that already have the [thrown](../../rules/traits/thrown.md) trait, the range increases by 10 feet. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a thrown axe weapon, you apply the axe's critical specialization effect.
