# Rapid Mantel  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

You easily pull yourself onto ledges. When you [Grab an Edge](../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md), you can pull yourself onto that surface and stand. You can use [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) instead of a Reflex save to [Grab an Edge](../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md).
