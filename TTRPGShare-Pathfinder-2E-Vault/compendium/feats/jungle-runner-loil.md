# Jungle Runner  *Feat 5*  
[vanara](../../rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  


You run through the jungle as easily as you would through an open field. You ignore difficult terrain from underbrush within forests and jungles. You can always use the [Take Cover](../../rules/actions/take-cover.md) action when you're within forest or jungle terrain to gain cover, even if you aren't adjacent to an obstacle you can [Take Cover](../../rules/actions/take-cover.md) behind.
