# Accursed Clay Fist  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [curse](../../rules/traits/curse.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golem Grafter Dedication](golem-grafter-dedication-ec3.md), expert in unarmed attacks

You have replaced one of your forearms with one made of clay and infused with cursed arcane magic. When you make an unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your clay fist and hit, your target takes a –2 status penalty to saving throws against [curse](../../rules/traits/curse.md) effects for 1 hour.

**Special.** The damage die for your clay fist is `1d8`, and it loses the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) and [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md) traits of a typical fist.
