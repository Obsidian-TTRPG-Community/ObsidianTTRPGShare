# Creative Prodigy  *Feat 1*  
[ganzi](../../rules/traits/ganzi-loag.md)  


You have a powerful creative drive, useful for prevarication and performance. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) and [Performance](../skills.md#Performance). If you are already trained in either of these skills, you become trained in a skill of your choice in its place. You also become trained in [Art Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
