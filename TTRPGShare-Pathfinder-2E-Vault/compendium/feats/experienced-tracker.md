# Experienced Tracker  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)

Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can [Track](../../rules/actions/track.md) while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) check. If you're a master in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival), you don't take the –5 penalty. If you're legendary in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival), you no longer need to roll a new [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.

## Experienced Tracker leads to...

[Swift Tracker](swift-tracker.md)
