# Incredible Scout  *Feat 11*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Perception](../skills.md#Perception)

When you scout, you are particularly alert for danger, granting your allies precious moments to prepare to fight. When using the [Scout](../../rules/actions/scout.md) exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.
