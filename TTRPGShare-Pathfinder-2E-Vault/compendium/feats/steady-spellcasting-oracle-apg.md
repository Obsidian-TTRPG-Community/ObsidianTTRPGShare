# Steady Spellcasting (Oracle)  *Feat 6*  
[oracle](../../rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  


Confident in your technique, you don't easily lose your concentration when you [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md). If another creature's reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn't disrupted.
