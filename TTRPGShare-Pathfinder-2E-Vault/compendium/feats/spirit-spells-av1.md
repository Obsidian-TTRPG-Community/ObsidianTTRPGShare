# Spirit Spells  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Hunter Dedication](ghost-hunter-dedication-av1.md)

Your ability to confront incorporeal menaces develops into full-fledged spellcasting. Choose a 1st-level occult spell. You can [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) as an innate occult spell. At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-level occult spell, and at 8th level, you gain a 3rd-level occult spell. Each of these spells must have the [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md), [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md), or [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md) trait. You can cast each of these spells once per day.
