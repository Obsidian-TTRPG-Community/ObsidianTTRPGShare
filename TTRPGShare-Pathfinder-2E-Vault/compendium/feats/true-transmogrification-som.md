# True Transmogrification  *Feat 18*  
[summoner](../../rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  


You transmogrify your eidolon each day. During your daily preparations, you can swap out any number of your evolution feats, each for a different evolution feat of an appropriate level for which you meet the prerequisites.

These swaps last until your next daily preparations.
