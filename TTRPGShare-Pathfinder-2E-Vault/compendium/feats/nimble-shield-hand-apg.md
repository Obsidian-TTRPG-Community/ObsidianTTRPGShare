# Nimble Shield Hand  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bastion Dedication](bastion-dedication-apg.md)

You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even while using the hand that's holding it for other purposes. The hand you use to wield a shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action. You can also hold another object in this hand (but you still can't use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn't apply to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome.
