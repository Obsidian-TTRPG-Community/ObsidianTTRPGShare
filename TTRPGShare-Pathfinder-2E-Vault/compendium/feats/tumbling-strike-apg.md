# Tumbling Strike  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  [move](../../rules/traits/move.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](acrobat-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to an enemy.
- **Activity** Single Action

Attempt an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check against the Reflex DC of an enemy adjacent to you.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You move through the enemy's space to an unoccupied space on the other side of the enemy from your starting position. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can't move farther than your Speed, and you must end your movement adjacent to the enemy whose space you moved through. After moving, you make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the enemy whose space you moved through, and the enemy is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against that [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
> - **Success** As critical success, but the enemy isn't [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
> - **Failure** You remain in your original space but can still [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
> - **Critical Failure** No effect.
