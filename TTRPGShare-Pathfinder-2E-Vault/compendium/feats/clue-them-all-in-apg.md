# Clue Them All In  *Feat 8*  
[investigator](../../rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  


You can clue in all your allies at once. When you use the [Clue In](../../rules/actions/clue-in-apg.md) reaction, any of your allies who are attempting the same check to investigate a lead receive the circumstance bonus from [Clue In](../../rules/actions/clue-in-apg.md). If you use this ability during an encounter, they must attempt their check within 1 round of when you Clued them In.

## Clue Them All In leads to...
