# Words Of Unraveling  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Researcher Dedication](eldritch-researcher-dedication-av2.md)

You have unlocked abstruse methods to tangle with reality itself, altering the fate of a single individual. Once per day as an occult innate spell, you can cast [daydreamer's curse](../spells/daydreamers-curse-av2.md), [outcast's curse](../spells/outcasts-curse.md), or savant's curse. At the GM's discretion, you can substitute or add additional occult curse spells of 4th level or lower to this list. You can choose a different spell from the list each time you use this ability. If you couldn't already cast occult spells, these spells use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells; if you could already cast occult spells, your proficiency in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells increases to expert.
