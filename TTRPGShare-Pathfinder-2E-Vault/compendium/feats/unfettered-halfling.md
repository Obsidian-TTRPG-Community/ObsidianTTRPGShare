# Unfettered Halfling  *Feat 1*  
[halfling](../../rules/traits/halfling.md)  


You were forced into service as a laborer, either pressed into indentured servitude or shackled by the evils of slavery, but you've since escaped and have trained to ensure you'll never be caught again. Whenever you roll a success on a check to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) or a saving throw against an effect that would impose the [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition on you, you get a critical success instead. Whenever a creature rolls a failure on a check to [Grapple](../../rules/actions/grapple.md) you, they get a critical failure instead. If a creature uses the [Grab](../../rules/abilities/grab.md) ability on you, it must succeed at an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to grab you instead of automatically grabbing you.
