# Garden Path  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bellflower Dedication](bellflower-dedication-aoa3.md)

You can guide your crop to move without notice. When you and any of your crop are [Avoiding Notice](../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md), you can choose one member of your crop to temporarily gain the benefits of the [Quiet Allies](quiet-allies.md) skill feat until the group is no longer [Avoiding Notice](../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md). The group rolls two checks instead of one, using the higher die roll. This is a [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect.
