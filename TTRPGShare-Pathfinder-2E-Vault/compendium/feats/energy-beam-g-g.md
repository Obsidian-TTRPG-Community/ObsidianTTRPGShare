# Energy Beam  *Feat 1*  
[automaton](../../rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md)  


You can channel your core's power through the magical gem that serves as your eye. You gain an energy beam ranged unarmed attack that deals `1d4` fire damage. The energy beam has a range increment of 20 feet. On a critical hit, the target takes [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Your eye beam does not add critical specialization effects.

**Enhancement** You channel greater power. Increase the damage die of your energy beam by one step, from `1d4` to `1d6`.
