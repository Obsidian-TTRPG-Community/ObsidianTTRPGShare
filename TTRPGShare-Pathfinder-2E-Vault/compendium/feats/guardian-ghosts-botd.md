# Guardian Ghosts  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Master Dedication](undead-master-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** You would take damage from a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) while one of your undead companions is adjacent to you.
- **Activity** Reaction

You magically divert some of the harm from an incoming attack away from yourself, forcing your undead companion to take it in your stead. Reduce the damage you take from the triggering [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) by 2 + your level. Your adjacent undead companion loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount of damage reduced. If you have more than one adjacent undead companion, you choose which one loses Hit Points. You can't divert the damage to a temporary fragment from [Their Master's Call](their-masters-call-botd.md).
