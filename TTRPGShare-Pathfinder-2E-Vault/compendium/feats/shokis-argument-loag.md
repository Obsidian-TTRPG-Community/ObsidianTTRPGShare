# Shoki's Argument  *Feat 5*  
[duskwalker](../../rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  


You feel a connection to shokis, the rambling collectors of wayward souls, and might have found old texts written by one. You are trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy). If you were already trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can also cast [disrupt undead](../spells/disrupt-undead.md) as a divine innate cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
