- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society)

You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a noble and play games of influence and politics. You can use [Society](../skills.md#Society) to [Make an Impression](../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on a noble, as well as with [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) to pretend to be a noble if you aren't one. If you want to impersonate a specific noble, you still need to use [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) to [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) normally, and to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) when necessary.
