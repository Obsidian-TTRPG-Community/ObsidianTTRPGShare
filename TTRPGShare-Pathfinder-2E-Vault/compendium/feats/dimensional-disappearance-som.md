# Dimensional Disappearance  *Feat 10*  
[magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: dimensional assault focus spell, laughing shadow hybrid study

You take advantage of teleportation to better hide your position. When you cast dimensional assault, you're affected by an [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.md) spell at the end of the teleport. You can choose not to make the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that is normally part of dimensional assault. If you do make the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), your invisibility ends after the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), as normal for invisibility.
