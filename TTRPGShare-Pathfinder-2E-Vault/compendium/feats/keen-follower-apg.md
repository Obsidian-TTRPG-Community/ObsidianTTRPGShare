# Keen Follower  *Feat 3*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  


Your keen observation of your allies has made you better at following their lead. When using the [Follow the Expert](../../rules/actions/follow-the-expert.md) activity in exploration mode, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus if the ally you are following is an expert and a +4 circumstance bonus if your ally is a master.
