# Alchemical Scholar  *Feat 1*  
[hobgoblin](../../rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md)  


You learn formulas more easily. You gain four common 1st-level alchemical formulas when you take this feat, and each time you gain a level, you gain a common alchemical formula of that level. You still need [Alchemical Crafting](alchemical-crafting.md) to [Craft](../../rules/actions/craft.md) alchemical items.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.
