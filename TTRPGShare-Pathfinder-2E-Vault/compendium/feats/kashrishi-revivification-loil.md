# Kashrishi Revivification  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 13*  
[kashrishi](../../rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You have the [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.
- **Activity** Free Action

You can use Kashrishi Revivification even if you're otherwise unable to act.

The well of psychic energy held within your mind can exceed the limitations of your physical body. You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) and [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition as normal for losing the [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition.
