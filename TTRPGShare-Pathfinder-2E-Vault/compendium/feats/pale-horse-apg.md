# Pale Horse  *Feat 12*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (steed), tenets of evil

Your mount becomes a grotesque creature of foreboding when you ride it. Its appearance transforms as flames erupt from its skin, a whorl of negative energy surrounds it, or poison leaks from its flesh. When you [Mount](../../rules/actions/mount.md) your steed ally, you can choose fire, negative, or poison. As long as you ride it, your steed gains resistance 10 to the chosen damage type, and any creature that touches your steed takes `1d6` damage of the chosen type; this includes hitting the steed with unarmed attacks or with a melee weapon [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) while adjacent to the steed. This damage increases to `2d6` at 16th level and `3d6` at 20th level.
