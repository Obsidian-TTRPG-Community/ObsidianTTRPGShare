# Wave Spiral  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [water](../../rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Reflective Ripple Stance](reflective-ripple-stance-som.md)
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Requirements**: You're in Reflective Ripple Stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You dip and spin, unleashing a wide whirlpool of water. Make an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) each creature standing on the ground in a 10-foot emanation. These attacks all count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you make all the attacks.
