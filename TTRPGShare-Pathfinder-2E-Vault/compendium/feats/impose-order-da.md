# Impose Order  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [psyche](../../rules/traits/psyche-da.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Requirements**: precise discipline subconscious mind
- **Activity** Single Action

You bring discipline to your mind and magic, ensuring that you don't under-perform. Until the end of your turn, instead of rolling dice for damage, count each damage die as average damage rounded up (3 for d4, 4 for d6, 5 for d8, 6 for d10, and 7 for d12).
