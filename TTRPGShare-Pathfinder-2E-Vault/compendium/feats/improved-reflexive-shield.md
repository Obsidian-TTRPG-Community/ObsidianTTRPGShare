# Improved Reflexive Shield  *Feat 16*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Reflexive Shield](reflexive-shield.md)

Your shield can help save nearby allies. When you use [Shield Block](shield-block.md) against damage resulting from a Reflex save, adjacent allies who would take damage due to Reflex saves against the same effect also benefit from the damage reduction.
