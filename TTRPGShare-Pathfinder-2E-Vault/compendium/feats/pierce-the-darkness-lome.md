# Pierce The Darkness  *Feat 1*  
[goloma](../../rules/traits/goloma-lome.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: low-light vision

Your eyes have adapted to see in all circumstances, even without the assistance of light.

You gain [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md), allowing you to see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can in bright light. However, in darkness you see in black and white only.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
