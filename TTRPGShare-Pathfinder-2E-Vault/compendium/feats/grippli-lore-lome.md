# Grippli Lore  *Feat 1*  
[grippli](../../rules/traits/grippli-b2.md)  


You are well versed in grippli culture and tactics. You gain the trained proficiency in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) and [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Grippli Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
