# Superior Sight  *Feat 20*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


Your senses are peerless. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks, and you gain [low-light vision](../../rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md).

If you already have low-light vision, gain [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) instead. Furthermore, when you target an enemy, you automatically succeed at the flat check if that enemy is [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed), [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden), or [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected).
