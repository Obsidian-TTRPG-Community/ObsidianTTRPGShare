# Hit The Dirt!  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature you can see attempts a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against you.
- **Activity** Reaction

You fling yourself out of harm's way. You [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md). Your movement gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. Regardless of whether or not the triggering attack hits, you land [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone) after completing your [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md).

## Hit The Dirt! leads to...

[Leap And Fire](leap-and-fire-g-g.md)
