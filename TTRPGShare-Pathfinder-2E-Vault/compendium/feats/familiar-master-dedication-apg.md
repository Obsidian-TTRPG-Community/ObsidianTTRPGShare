# Familiar Master Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  


You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn. Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar (Core Rulebook 198). If you already have a familiar, you gain the [Enhanced Familiar](enhanced-familiar-wizard.md) feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the familiar master archetype.

## Familiar Master Dedication leads to...

[Familiar Conduit](familiar-conduit-apg.md), [Familiar Mascot](familiar-mascot-apg.md), [Improved Familiar (Familiar Master)](improved-familiar-familiar-master-apg.md), [Mutable Familiar](mutable-familiar-apg.md)
