# Planar Survival  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)

You can [Subsist](../../rules/actions/subsist.md) using [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) on different planes, even those without resources or natural phenomena you normally need. For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks food that could normally sustain you. A success on your check to [Subsist](../../rules/actions/subsist.md) can also reduce the damage dealt by the plane, at the GM's discretion.
