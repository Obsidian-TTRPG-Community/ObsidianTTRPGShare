[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Living Vessel Dedication](living-vessel-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You symbiotically combine your form with that of the entity within you, taking a powerful hybrid form to temporarily boost your abilities in combat while maintaining control. For 1 minute, you gain the following effects.

- If you were Medium or smaller, you become Large, and your reach increases to 10 feet.
- You gain a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls and a +1 status bonus on saving throws against spells. If you use Entity's Resurgence, the status bonuses to attack and damage rolls increase to +3 during the time that the two effects overlap.
- If you have the [Entity's Strike](entitys-strike-da.md) feat, the unarmed attack you gained from that feat increases its damage die from `1d6` to `1d8`.
- You gain 40 temporary Hit Points.
- You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed.

**Special.** This action has the tradition trait appropriate to your entity, typically divine for a demon, occult for an aberration or outer entity, or primal for a fey.
