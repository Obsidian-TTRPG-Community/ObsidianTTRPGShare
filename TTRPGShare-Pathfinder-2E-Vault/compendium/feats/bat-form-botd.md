# Bat Form  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vampire Dedication](vampire-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Single Action

You can transform into a bat. You gain the effects of a 4th-level [pest form](../spells/pest-form.md) spell. At 14th level, you can choose to spend two actions instead of one to gain the effects of a 4th- or 5th-level [aerial form](../spells/aerial-form.md) spell instead (bat form only).
