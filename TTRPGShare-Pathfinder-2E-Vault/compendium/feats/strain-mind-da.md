# Strain Mind  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You cast a psi cantrip.
- **Requirements**: You have 0 Focus Points.
- **Activity** Free Action

You strain your body beyond its limits to use an amp even when your mental power is depleted. You add an amp that costs 1 Focus Point to the spell. Instead of paying the normal Focus Point cost, you lose Hit Points equal to four times the spell level of the amped psi cantrip as you bleed from your nose or suffer some other visible sign of strain.
