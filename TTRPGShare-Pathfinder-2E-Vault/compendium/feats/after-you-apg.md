# After You  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 2*  
[swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.
- **Activity** Free Action

You allow your foes to make the first move in a show of incredible confidence. You don't roll initiative; instead you voluntarily go last. You gain Panache|Swashbuckler|APG|1. If more than one character uses this ability or another ability to go last, use the normal rules for resolving a tie: NPCs and monsters act before PCs, and within those groups, the creatures can choose whichever order they want.
