# Vivacious Afterimage  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 20*  
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: vivacious speed
- **Requirements**: You have panache.
- **Activity** Single Action

You move so quickly that you create a short-lived afterimage, looks exactly like you, in front of you or behind you. You [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md). At any point along your movement, you leave an afterimage of yourself behind.

Alternatively, you can stop moving and send your afterimage forward instead, up to the remainder of your Speed. A creature that spends actions to engage with your afterimage can attempt to 0 with a Will save against your class DC. Once an enemy has 0 any of your afterimages, they are temporarily immune to all of your Vivacious Afterimages for 10 minutes. As long as a creature has not 0, the afterimage counts as a creature for flanking. The afterimage lasts until the beginning of your next turn or until you use Vivacious Afterimage again, whichever comes first.
