# Death Warden  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [positive](../../rules/traits/positive.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hallowed Necromancer Dedication](hallowed-necromancer-dedication-botd.md)

With your intimate familiarity with the duality of positive and negative energy, you're able to stand as a bulwark against death and undeath alike. You gain resistance to negative damage equal to half your level and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects with the [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md) trait.
