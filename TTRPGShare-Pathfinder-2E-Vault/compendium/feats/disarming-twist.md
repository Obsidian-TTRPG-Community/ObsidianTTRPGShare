# Disarming Twist  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](../../rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding only a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.
- **Activity** Single Action

After your initial attack redirects your foe's defenses, your follow-up wrests their weapon from their grasp. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon. In addition to its other effects, this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) gains the success and critical success effects of the [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md) action. The [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) also has the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** The target is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of your current turn.
