# Siphon Life  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[aftermath](../../rules/traits/aftermath-da.md)  [flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: You've been reduced to 0 Hit Points by an enemy with the [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md) trait.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Experiences with necromantic energy have left a permanent mark on you, casting you in a deathlike pallor, chilling your body temperature to be ice-cold, turning your very blood black, and giving you the power to rip out an enemy's life force. [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with an unarmed attack. If you hit and the target is a living creature, it takes `4d6` additional negative damage, depending on its Fortitude save. If the target takes any negative damage, you gain an equal number of temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The enemy takes no additional negative damage and becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
> - **Success** The enemy takes half the additional negative damage.
> - **Failure** The enemy takes full additional negative damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The enemy takes double the additional negative damage.
