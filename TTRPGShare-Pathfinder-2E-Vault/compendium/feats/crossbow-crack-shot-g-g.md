# Crossbow Crack Shot  *Feat 1*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  


You have a deep understanding of the crossbow. When you're wielding a crossbow and [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) to reload it, including [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) actions as part of your slinger's reload and similar effects, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll on your next [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with that crossbow. As normal, this isn't cumulative with the +1 circumstance bonus from singular expertise. If the crossbow is a simple crossbow, also increase the damage die size for that attack by one step. You must make the attack before the end of your turn or these benefits are lost.
