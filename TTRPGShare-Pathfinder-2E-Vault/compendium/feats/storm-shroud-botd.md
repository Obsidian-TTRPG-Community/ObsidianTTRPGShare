# Storm Shroud  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](mummy-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Two-Action

You become surrounded by a swirling storm of rain, sand, snow, or clouds, whichever of those suits your bound terrain. This activity has traits appropriate to the storm you create— typically [earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md) for sand and [water](../../rules/traits/water.md) for rain, snow, or clouds. You become [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) for 1 minute. You can't use this concealment to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md), as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.
