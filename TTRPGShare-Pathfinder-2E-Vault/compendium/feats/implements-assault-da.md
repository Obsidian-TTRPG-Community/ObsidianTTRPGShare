# Implement's Assault  [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*  
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [thaumaturge](../../rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're holding an implement.
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your implement supercharges your weapon to shoot an impossible volley or carve through your foes. Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your weapon against each enemy within 30 feet of you. You don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after making all the attacks. If your weapon is a melee weapon and any of the attacks are outside your reach, you [Release](../../rules/actions/release.md) the weapon before the [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md), and it returns to your grasp after all of them. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.
