# Web Hunter  *Feat 9*  
[anadi](../../rules/traits/anadi-lome.md)  


Through the careful cultivation of highly sensitive hairs, you've developed the ability to sense creatures without seeing them. You gain imprecise [tremorsense](../../rules/abilities/tremorsense.md) at a range of 15 feet. When you and a creature are both touching the same anchored, threadlike object (such as a rope, webbing, or wire), your imprecise [tremorsense](../../rules/abilities/tremorsense.md) can sense that creature at a range of 60 feet.
