# Courteous Comeback  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 1*  
[fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [human](../../rules/traits/human.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Keleshite nationality
- **Trigger** You critically fail a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check.
- **Requirements**: You're in a settlement or community, and you haven't used Courteous Comeback in this settlement or community within the past month.
- **Activity** Free Action

You grew up in the proud Padishah Empire, where even insults have a certain poetic wit. Reroll the triggering [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check, using the second result.
