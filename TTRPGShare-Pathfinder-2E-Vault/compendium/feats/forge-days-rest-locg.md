# Forge-day's Rest  *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: underground dwarf ethnicity

Your unusual rest cycle allows you to recover faster.

As long as you rest for 12 hours, you gain the effects of the [Fast Recovery](fast-recovery.md) general feat and you can go 20 hours without resting before becoming [fatigued](../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued).
