# Nocturnal Grippli  *Feat 1*  
[grippli](../../rules/traits/grippli-b2.md)  


You tend to do most of your hunting and work at night and have adapted to the requirements of nocturnal life. You gain [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md), allowing you to see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can in bright light. However, in darkness, you see in black and white only.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
