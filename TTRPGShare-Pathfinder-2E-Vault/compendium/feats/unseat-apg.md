[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cavalier Dedication](cavalier-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are riding your mount and wielding a jousting weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You attempt to knock an opponent off their mount. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a mounted opponent. If your attack hits, attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check against the opponent's Fortitude DC. If you succeed, the foe is knocked off its mount into a space of its choice adjacent to its mount. If you critically succeed, it lands [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
