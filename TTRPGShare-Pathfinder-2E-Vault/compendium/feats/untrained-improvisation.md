# Untrained Improvisation  *Feat 3*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  


You've learned how to handle situations when you're out of your depth. Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks is equal to half your level instead of +0. If you're 7th level or higher, the bonus increases to your full level instead. This doesn't allow you to use the skill's trained actions.
