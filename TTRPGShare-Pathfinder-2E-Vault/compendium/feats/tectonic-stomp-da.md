# Tectonic Stomp  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[deviant](../../rules/traits/deviant-da.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You cause minor tremors that topple your enemies. All creatures in a 30-foot emanation who are standing on the ground take `1d6` bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels you have, with a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save also falls [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Awakening** Your stomp also ejects large fragments from the ground. You raise up to three stone chunks from the ground in unoccupied squares in the emanation; the stones can't be adjacent to one another. The chunks are 5 feet tall, block movement, and are large enough to [Take Cover](../../rules/actions/take-cover.md) behind. They have AC 10, Hardness 8, and Hit Points equal to your level.

They are immune to critical hits and precision damage. A stone chunk crumbles away when it has 0 Hit Points, and all of them crumble after 1 minute or when you use Tectonic Stomp again.

**Awakening** Your stomp rattles those who fail horribly. A creature that critically fails its save is also [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
