# Pinning Fire  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 8*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Trigger** You use [Flurry of Blows](../../rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md) to make two ranged piercing weapon [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the same target.
- **Activity** Free Action

You target your opponent's clothing, equipment, or loose flesh with piercing projectiles to pin them to the ground or a nearby surface. If both your attacks hit, the target must succeed at a Reflex save against your class DC or become [immobilized](../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it or an adjacent creature succeeds at a DC 10 [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to remove the pinning projectiles. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.
