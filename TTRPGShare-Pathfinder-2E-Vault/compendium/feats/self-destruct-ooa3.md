# Self-Destruct  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clockwork Reanimator Dedication](clockwork-reanimator-dedication-ooa3.md)
- **Trigger** Your reanimated clockwork companion is reduced to 0 Hit Points.
- **Requirements**: You're within 60 feet of your reanimated clockwork companion.
- **Activity** Reaction

You've installed a self-destruct device within your construct companion, which you can trigger with a special device from up to 60 feet away. When you activate the device, your reanimated construct companion explodes, dealing `2d6` fire damage per level to all creatures in a 30-foot radius. Creatures caught in the blast can attempt a basic Reflex save, with a DC equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
