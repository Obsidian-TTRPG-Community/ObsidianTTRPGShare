# Magical Adaptation  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Horizon Walker Dedication](horizon-walker-dedication-apg.md)

When an obstacle bars your path, you pull a trick from your sleeve to overcome it. You can cast [darkvision](../spells/darkvision.md), [spider climb](../spells/spider-climb.md), and 4th-level [water breathing](../spells/water-breathing.md) as innate primal spells, each once per day.
