# Aeon Resonance  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Embed Aeon Stone](embed-aeon-stone-som.md)

You gain the resonant power of one embedded aeon stone as if it were placed in a wayfinder. While you can embed multiple aeon stones in your flesh, you can gain the resonance power from only one embedded stone at a time, selected each day when you make your daily preparations.

**Special.** At 8th level, you can take this feat again. If you do, you gain the resonance powers of up to four invested aeon stones instead of only one.
