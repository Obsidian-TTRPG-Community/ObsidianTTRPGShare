# Cremate Undead  *Feat 8*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  


Your positive energy sets undead alight. When you use a [heal](../spells/heal.md) spell to damage undead, each undead that takes damage also takes [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the spell's level.
