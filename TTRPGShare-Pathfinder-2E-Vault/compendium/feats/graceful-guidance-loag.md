# Graceful Guidance  *Feat 5*  
[catfolk](../../rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md)  


You can demonstrate how to quickly twist out of the way of dangerous effects. You can use the [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) reaction to grant a bonus to an ally's Reflex save. As usual for [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md), you need to prepare by using an action on your turn to encourage the ally.
