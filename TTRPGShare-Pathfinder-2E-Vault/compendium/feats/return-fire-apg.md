# Return Fire  *Feat 6*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Deflect Arrow](deflect-arrow.md), [Monastic Archer Stance](monastic-archer-stance-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Monastic Archer Stance, are wielding a bow, and have a free hand.

Snatching an arrow out of the air, you instantly put it to your bow and return fire. When you successfully Deflect an Arrow, as part of that reaction you can immediately make a ranged bow [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) by firing the arrow you deflected from your own bow.
