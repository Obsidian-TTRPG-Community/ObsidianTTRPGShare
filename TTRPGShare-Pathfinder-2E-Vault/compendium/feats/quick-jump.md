# Quick Jump  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

You can use [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) and [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) as a single action instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don't perform the initial [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) (nor do you fail if you don't [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) 10 feet).
