- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Three-Action

You can [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) up to three times at any point during your movement, each against a different enemy. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you have made all your attacks.
