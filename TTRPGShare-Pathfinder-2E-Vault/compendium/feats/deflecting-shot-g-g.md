# Deflecting Shot  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[gunslinger](../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Trigger** An ally within the first range increment of your firearm or crossbow is hit by an attack, and you can see the attacker.
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Reaction

You're always ready to take a quick shot to deflect a weapon or distract a foe enough to render them off target. The ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the triggering attack. You use this reaction after the result of the attack roll is revealed, so you know whether the +2 will make a sufficient difference.
