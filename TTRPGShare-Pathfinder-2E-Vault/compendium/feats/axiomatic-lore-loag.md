# Axiomatic Lore  *Feat 1*  
[aphorite](../../rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md)  


You possess a strong understanding of process among mortals and lawful outsiders alike. The source of this knowledge might be intuition, study, or a childhood spent among other aphorites. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Society](../skills.md#Society). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Axis Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
