# Lead Climber  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

When climbing, you can prepare routes for others to follow, and you can pull your allies up to avoid disaster. When your allies attempt to [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md) a route you set using the [Follow the Expert](../../rules/actions/follow-the-expert.md) exploration activity, if any of them critically fail their checks to [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md), you can attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check against the same DC. If you succeed, your ally fails instead of critically failing. If you also critically fail, you both experience the consequences of the critical failure.
