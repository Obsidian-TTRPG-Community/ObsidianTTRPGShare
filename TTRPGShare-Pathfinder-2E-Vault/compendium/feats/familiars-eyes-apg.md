- **Prerequisites**: a familiar
- **Activity** Single Action

While projecting your senses in this way, you can converse telepathically with your familiar if it understands a language.

**Special.** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
