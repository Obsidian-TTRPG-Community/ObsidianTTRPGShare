# Pack Rat  *Feat 1*  
[ratfolk](../../rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md)  


Years of packing for travel have taught you how to cram vast quantities into small spaces. You can fit an additional 50% of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane storage containers or vehicles. For example, you can fit 6 Bulk in a backpack, or 12 Bulk in a chest. This doesn't alter the items' Bulk, nor does it change how much you can store in a magical or extradimensional storage space, such as a bag of holding.
