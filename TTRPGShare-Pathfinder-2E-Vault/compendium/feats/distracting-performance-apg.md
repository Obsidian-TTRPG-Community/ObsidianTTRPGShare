# Distracting Performance  *Feat 2*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance)

Your performances are especially distracting, allowing your allies to [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) away with ease. When you [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) an ally who is trying to [Create a Diversion](../../rules/actions/create-a-diversion.md), instead of the usual effects of [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md), you can roll a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check and use that result to determine the outcome of the diversion, instead of the ally rolling a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check.
