# Clone-Risen  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [reflection](../../rules/traits/reflection-da.md)  


You were formed from a clone ritual or alchemical experiment. Created as a vessel for another creature, you can suppress your sentience momentarily, making your mind harder to alter. You gain the Empty Vessel reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Empty Vessel [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Trigger**: You would take mental damage or be affected by a [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect

**Effect** You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves and resistance to mental damage equal to your level against the triggering effect. This applies only to the initial effect, not successive saves, [persistent mental damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), or other repeated effects.
