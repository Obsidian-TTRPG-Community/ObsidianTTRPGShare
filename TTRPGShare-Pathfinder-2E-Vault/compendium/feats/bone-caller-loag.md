# Bone Caller  *Feat 9*  
[lizardfolk](../../rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  


Using a mixture of dinosaur bones and the bones of your ancestors to focus your magic, you animate lizards and dinosaurs to carry messages or serve as mounts.

You can cast [animal messenger](../spells/animal-messenger.md) and [phantom steed](../spells/phantom-steed.md) as primal innate spells once per day each. The animal messenger is always a Tiny dinosaur or lizard, and your innate spell transforms it from bones to flesh, even if there are no dinosaurs or lizards nearby. The phantom steed looks like a dinosaur rather than a horse but functions identically.
