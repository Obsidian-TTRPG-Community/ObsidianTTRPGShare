[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Tangled Forest Stance](tangled-forest-stance.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Tangled Forest Stance.
- **Activity** Single Action

You reposition foes with raking attacks. Make a lashing branch [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and deal damage, you force the target to move 5 feet into a space within your reach. This follows the forced movement rules found on page 475.
