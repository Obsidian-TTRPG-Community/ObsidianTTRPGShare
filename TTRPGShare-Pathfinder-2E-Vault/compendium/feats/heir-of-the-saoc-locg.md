# Heir Of The Saoc  *Feat 9*  
[human](../../rules/traits/human.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Saoc Astrology](saoc-astrology-locg.md)

In the past, you would have been a proud initiate of the Saoc Brethren. Today, you carry on their legacy. When you use Saoc Astrology, roll `1d4` instead; on a 1, you take a –1 penalty to the skill check. On any other result, you gain a circumstance bonus of that value (for instance, a +3 circumstance bonus on a 3).
