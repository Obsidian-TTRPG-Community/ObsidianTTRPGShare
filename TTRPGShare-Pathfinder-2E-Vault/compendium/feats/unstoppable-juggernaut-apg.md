# Unstoppable Juggernaut  *Feat 20*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  


You have become a brutal, unstoppable force of nature, able to shrug off mortal wounds with ease. You gain resistance equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier to all damage, and your resistance from [raging](../../rules/actions/rage.md) increases to 8 + your Constitution modifier.

In addition, if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points while [raging](../../rules/actions/rage.md), you can end your rage as a reaction to stay at 1 Hit Point. If you do, you become [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) (or increase your [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition by 2 if you are already [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded)).
