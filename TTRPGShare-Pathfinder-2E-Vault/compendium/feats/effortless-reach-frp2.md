# Effortless Reach  *Feat 18*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


Focusing the powers of your ki to augment your blows, you stretch and lengthen your body in ways that defy logic.

Your unarmed attacks gain the [reach](../../rules/traits/reach.md) trait.
