[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [teleportation](../../rules/traits/teleportation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellshot Dedication](spellshot-dedication-g-g.md), master in [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded magical firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You infuse your entire being into a single shot, merging your body into the blast and enabling you to travel the same path as your bolt or bullet. [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) a creature with the required weapon. On a success, if the target was within 120 feet, you and all your gear are teleported to an open space of your choice within 10 feet of the target.
