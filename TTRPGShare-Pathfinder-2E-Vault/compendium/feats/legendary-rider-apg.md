# Legendary Rider  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cavalier Dedication](cavalier-dedication-apg.md)

You and your mount move like one being, effortlessly reading each other's signals. Whenever you are riding your mount, you are [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened); you can use the extra action only to command your mount using the [Command an Animal](../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) skill action.
