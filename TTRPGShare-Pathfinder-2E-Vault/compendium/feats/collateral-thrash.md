- **Prerequisites**: [Thrash](thrash.md)

When you Thrash a [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) foe, you smack that foe into another nearby. Another foe adjacent to the [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) foe also takes your Thrash damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC.

## Collateral Thrash leads to...
