# Murderous Thorns  *Feat 5*  
[ghoran](../../rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) Thorn or thorned rose

Your thorns are many, vicious, and sharp. If you have the [Hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) Thorn feat, your thorn attack gains the deadly d6 trait. If you have the thorned rose heritage, you can use the [Wicked Thorns](../../rules/actions/wicked-thorns-loil.md) reaction once every hour.
