# Dig Quickly  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [shoony](../../rules/traits/shoony-ec3.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are standing on dirt, sand, snow, or similar particulate material.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your hands work as effectively as shovels when you need to dig a quick hole.

You dig a shallow pit in the square you currently occupy, turning the square into difficult terrain (including for you). In addition, you also kick up a cloud of grit in a direction of your choice. The cloud extinguishes small, unattended, non-magical fires and helps smother the flames on burning creatures located within the cone; creatures in this cone that are taking [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) can immediately attempt an additional flat DC 15 check to end the [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
