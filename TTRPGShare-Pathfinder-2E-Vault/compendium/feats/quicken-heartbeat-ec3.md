# Quicken Heartbeat  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golem Grafter Dedication](golem-grafter-dedication-ec3.md)
- **Frequency**: once per turn
- **Activity** Single Action

You've replaced your heart with one made of animated quicksilver and living adamantine. You reduce your [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition by 1. Alternatively, if you are not [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed), you are [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) during your next turn, and can use your extra action to [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
