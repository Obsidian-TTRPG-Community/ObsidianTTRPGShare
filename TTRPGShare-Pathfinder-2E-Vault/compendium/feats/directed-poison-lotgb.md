[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [cloudkill](../spells/cloudkill.md)

When you cast [cloudkill](../spells/cloudkill.md), modify its duration to be sustained up to 1 minute, and modify its standard effect to include the following: The cloud doesn't move away from you each round.

Once per round when you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can move the cloud 10 feet in the direction of your choice.
