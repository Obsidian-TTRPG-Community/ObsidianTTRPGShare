# Ashen Veil  [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 7*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md), expert in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion), master in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)
- **Activity** Three-Action

By smearing ash or tainted earth over your skin and armor, you shroud yourself from the dead. You become [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to undead using vision or lifesense, allowing you to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) without other sources of cover or concealment. This effect lasts only as long as you continue to take no actions other than to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md), [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md), or other surreptitious actions. The GM determines which actions end the effect, but attacking, casting spells, activating items, and the like always do.
