# Can't You See?  *Feat 8*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism), expert in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)

The eye rebels, the mind recoils—no matter how much those who can see you try to explain what's there, their friends' gazes just skitter over you, like a bird afraid to land. A character who attempts to [Point Out](../../rules/actions/point-out.md) your location must attempt a DC 14 flat check. If they fail, their allies misunderstand them and aren't sure where you are. On a critical failure, their allies think they pointed you out in a different location entirely, chosen by the GM. Similarly, when a creature critically fails to [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) you while you're [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to or [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by it, it thinks you're in a different location chosen by the GM. In either case, you appear to be [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to a creature that thinks you're in a different location, though you're actually [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by it for targeting and further uses of the [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) action.
