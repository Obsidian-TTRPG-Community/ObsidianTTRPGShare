# Alkenstar Agent Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You have been initiated by the grand duchess of Alkenstar or one of her agents.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) and at least one firearm

You put on the persona of a rough and tumble outlaw, but your real goals are to report threats to Alkenstar back to the grand duchess. You become an expert in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) and trained in your choice of [Underworld Lore](../skills.md#Lore) or [Legal Lore](../skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain the [Lie to Me](lie-to-me.md) skill feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the Alkenstar Agent archetype.
