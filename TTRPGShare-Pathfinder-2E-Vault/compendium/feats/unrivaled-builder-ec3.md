# Unrivaled Builder  *Feat 13*  
[shoony](../../rules/traits/shoony-ec3.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Handy with Your Paws

Building things is like solving a puzzle, and you know how to use anything at your disposal to get the job done. You gain [creation](../spells/creation.md) as a 5th-level innate primal spell. You must have an equivalent Bulk of material to create an item, such as wood or scrap metal to make a wheelbarrow. You can cast this spell once each day.
