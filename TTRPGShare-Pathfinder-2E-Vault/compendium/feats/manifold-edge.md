# Manifold Edge  *Feat 18*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: hunter's edge, masterful hunter

You've learned every possible edge to use against your foes. When you use [Hunt Prey](../../rules/actions/hunt-prey.md), you can gain a hunter's edge benefit other than the one you selected at 1st level. If you do, you don't gain the additional benefit from masterful hunter.
