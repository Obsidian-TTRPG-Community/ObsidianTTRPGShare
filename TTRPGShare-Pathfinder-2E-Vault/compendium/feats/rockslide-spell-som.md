# Rockslide Spell  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](elementalist-dedication-som.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enhance your spell with elemental earth, causing chunks of stone to litter the ground. If the next action you use is to [Cast a non-cantrip Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that affects an area, a number of 5-foot squares in the area equal to the spell level become difficult terrain for 1 round. These squares must be on the ground, and the entire area of difficult terrain must be contiguous. The spell gains the [earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md) trait.
