# Vishkanya Weapon Expertise  *Feat 13*  
[vishkanya](../../rules/traits/vishkanya-loil.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Vishkanya Weapon Familiarity

Extensive training has granted you an elegant control in the use of vishkanyan weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the blowgun, fighting fan, kris, kukri, shuriken, and all vishkanyan weapons in which you are trained.
