# Fetchling Lore  *Feat 1*  
[fetchling](../../rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md)  


You've learned obscure lessons about your fellow fetchlings. You're trained in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) and [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Shadow Plane Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
