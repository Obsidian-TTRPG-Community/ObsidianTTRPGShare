# Heroic Presence  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 17*  
[emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [human](../../rules/traits/human.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

The blood of heroes courses through your veins, and you inspire your allies to dig deep and find a new level of resolve. You grant up to 10 willing creatures within 30 feet the effects of a 6th-level [zealous conviction](../spells/zealous-conviction.md), though the effect automatically ends on a target if you give that target a command they would normally find repugnant. This action has the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) trait or [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) trait, depending on how you inspire your allies.
