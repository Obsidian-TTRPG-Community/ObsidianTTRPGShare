# Semblance of Life  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](mummy-dedication-botd.md)
- **Trigger** You deal damage to a living creature with your fist [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) or with [Desiccating Inhalation](desiccating-inhalation-botd.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

You draw the moisture you've drained from others into your own flesh, temporarily taking on the appearance of life. This has the effects of [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md), except you can appear only as yourself while you were a living humanoid.
