# Deadly Butterfly  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Butterfly Blade Dedication](butterfly-blade-dedication-frp1.md)

You gain access to the butterfly sword's critical specialization effect. If you already had access to the critical specialization effect or you gain the effect at a later time, you also gain the critical specialization effect for knives when you critically hit with a butterfly sword. You can benefit from only one critical specialization effect at a time.
