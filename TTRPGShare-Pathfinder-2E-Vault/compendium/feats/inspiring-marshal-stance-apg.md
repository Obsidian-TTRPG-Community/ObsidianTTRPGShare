# Inspiring Marshal Stance  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [open](../../rules/traits/open.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](marshal-dedication-apg.md), trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)
- **Activity** Single Action

You become a brilliant example of dedication and poise in battle, encouraging your allies to follow suit. When you spend this action, attempt a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your marshal's aura increases to a 20-foot emanation and grants you and allies a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saves against [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects.
> - **Success** As critical success, but your aura's size doesn't increase.
> - **Failure** You fail to enter the stance.
> - **Critical Failure** You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.
