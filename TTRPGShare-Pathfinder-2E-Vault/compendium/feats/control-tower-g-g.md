# Control Tower  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Overwatch Dedication](overwatch-dedication-g-g.md), master in [Perception](../skills.md#Perception)

Your keen senses and ability to process battlefield information have dramatically improved, allowing you to drastically reduce the advantage of unseen foes. You and allies in your overwatch field gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) action to find [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creatures within the overwatch field. You and your allies don't have to succeed at a flat check to target a [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) creature within your overwatch field. When you or an ally targets a [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creature in your overwatch field, reduce the DC of the flat check to 5.
