# Consult The Stars  *Feat 1*  
[lizardfolk](../../rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  


You find wisdom in the movements of the heavens. Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to draw upon your readings of a recent night's sky to gain the trained proficiency rank in one skill of your choice; the chosen skill's key attribute must be Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. This proficiency lasts until your next daily preparation. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.
