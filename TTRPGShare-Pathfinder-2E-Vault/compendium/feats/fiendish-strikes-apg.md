# Fiendish Strikes  *Feat 13*  
[tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


Your festering connection to the forces of evil infuses your weapons with debilitating malevolence, tearing down creatures of good with every attack. All your weapon and unarmed [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deal 1 additional evil damage and have the [evil](../../rules/traits/evil.md) and [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md) traits.
