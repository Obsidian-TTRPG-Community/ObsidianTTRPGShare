# Rallying Cry  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [hobgoblin](../../rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You call out to your allies and push them to give their all in combat. All allies within 30 feet that can hear you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level. In addition, these allies become [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 minute but can only use the extra action to [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md), [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), or [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
