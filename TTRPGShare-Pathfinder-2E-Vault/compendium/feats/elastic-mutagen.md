# Elastic Mutagen  *Feat 10*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)

Whenever you are under the effects of a quicksilver mutagen, you can stretch your legs and [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) up to 10 feet, and you can squish and compress your body, allowing you to make it through tight spaces as if you were one size smaller, in addition to any effect from [Squeezing](../../rules/actions/squeeze.md).
