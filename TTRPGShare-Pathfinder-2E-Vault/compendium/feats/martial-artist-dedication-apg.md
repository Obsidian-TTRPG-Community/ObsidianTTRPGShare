# Martial Artist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  


You have trained to use your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist unarmed attacks becomes `1d6` instead of `1d4`. You don't take the –2 circumstance penalty for making a lethal attack with your [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md) unarmed attacks.

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in all unarmed attacks.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the martial artist archetype.
