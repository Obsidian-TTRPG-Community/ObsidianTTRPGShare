# Deep Freeze  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md)  [inventor](../../rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You vent a jet of supercooled fluid from your innovation, damaging a foe and slowing it down. Target one creature within 60 feet. That creature takes cold damage equal to your level, with effects depending on its Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round, and takes a –15-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.

**Unstable Function** Your innovation discharges an enormous cone of supercooled fluid, potentially causing cascading failures. Add the unstable trait to Deep Freeze. The ability affects all creatures within a 60-foot cone instead of a single target, and it deals cold damage equal to double your level instead of equal to your level.
