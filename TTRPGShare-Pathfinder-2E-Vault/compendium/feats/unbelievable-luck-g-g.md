# Unbelievable Luck  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication](unexpected-sharpshooter-dedication-g-g.md)

You can use the [Accidental Shot](../../rules/actions/accidental-shot-g-g.md) activity granted to you by the Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication once per hour instead of once per day.
