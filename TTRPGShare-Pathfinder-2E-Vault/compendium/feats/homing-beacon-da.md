# Homing Beacon  *Feat 4*  
[amp](../../rules/traits/amp-da.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  


As your spell strikes a target, you plant a beacon in the target's mind that announces its presence to those nearby. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw.
