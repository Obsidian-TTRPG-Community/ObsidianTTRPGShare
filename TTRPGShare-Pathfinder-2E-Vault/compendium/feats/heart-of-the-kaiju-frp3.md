# Heart Of The Kaiju  *Feat 20*  
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Monstrosity Shape](monstrosity-shape.md)

Witnessing the might of the kaiju King Mogaru, Alru, and Toraloa up close awoke a new ferocity within you. When you transform using Monstrosity Shape, you can take on a kaiju form. When you take this feat, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage; this is the damage your breath weapon deals. You can't change this later. The battle form is Gargantuan size with the following specific abilities; the damage values already include the extra die from being a 9th-level spell.

- **Kaiju** Speed 40 feet; physical resistance 5; Melee [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws (reach <20 feet>), Damage `3d12+20` piercing; Melee [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") claws (agile, reach <20 feet>), Damage `3d8+20` slashing; Breath Weapon [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (evocation, primal) Each creature in a 60-foot cone takes `15d6` damage (of your chosen damage type), with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. Once activated, your breath weapon can't be used again for `1d4` rounds.
