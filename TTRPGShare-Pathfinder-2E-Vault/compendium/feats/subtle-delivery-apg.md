# Subtle Delivery  *Feat 1*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


You can capably deliver toxins with a blowgun. Your blowgun [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance. If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a blowgun loaded with a dart you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.
