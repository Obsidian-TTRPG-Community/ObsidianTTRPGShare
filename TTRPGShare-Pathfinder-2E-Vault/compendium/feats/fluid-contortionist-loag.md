# Fluid Contortionist  *Feat 5*  
[undine](../../rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  


You can ignore difficult terrain caused by moving through tight spaces that aren't tight enough to force you to [Squeeze](../../rules/actions/squeeze.md). When you roll a critical failure on a check to [Squeeze](../../rules/actions/squeeze.md), you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
