# Snagging Strike  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You combine an attack with quick grappling moves to throw an enemy off balance as long as it stays in your reach. Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) while keeping one hand free. If this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the target is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn or until it's no longer within the reach of your hand, whichever comes first.
