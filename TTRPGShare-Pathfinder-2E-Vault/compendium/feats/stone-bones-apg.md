# Stone Bones  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  

- **Trigger** You are struck by a critical hit that deals physical damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your intractable nature can help you shrug off even the most grievous injuries. Attempt a DC 17 flat check. If you are successful, the attack becomes a normal hit.
