# Nocturnal Sense  *Feat 6*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acute Scent](acute-scent.md), or precise or imprecise [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md) and [low-light vision](../../rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md)

Your senses gain even greater clarity. While [raging](../../rules/actions/rage.md), you gain [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) if you don't already have it, and the range of your imprecise [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md) increases to 60 feet.
