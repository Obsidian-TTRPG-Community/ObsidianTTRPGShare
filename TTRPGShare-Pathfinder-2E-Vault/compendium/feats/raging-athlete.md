# Raging Athlete  *Feat 4*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

Physical obstacles can't hold back your fury. While you are [raging](../../rules/actions/rage.md), you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to your land Speed and the DC of [High Jumps](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) and [Long Jumps](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) decreases by 10. Your distance for a vertical Leap increases to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet and to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.
