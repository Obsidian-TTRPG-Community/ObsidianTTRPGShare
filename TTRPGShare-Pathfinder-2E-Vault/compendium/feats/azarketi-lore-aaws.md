# Azarketi Lore  *Feat 1*  
[azarketi](../../rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md)  


You have learned the history and origins of your people and how to connect to both your land and sea heritage. You become trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) and [Nature](../skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Azarketi Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
