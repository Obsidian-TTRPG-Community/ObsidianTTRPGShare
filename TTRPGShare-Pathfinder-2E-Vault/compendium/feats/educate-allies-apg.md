# Educate Allies  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Well-Versed](well-versed-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An ally benefiting from one of your composition spells is subject to an effect with the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md), [illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md), [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md), [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md), or [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

You tweak the properties of your composition spell to convey a bit of your defensive knowledge. All allies affected by your composition spell gain your +1 circumstance bonus from Well-Versed until the start of your next turn. Teaching your allies also bolsters your own skills; your personal circumstance bonus from Well-Versed also increases to +2 until the start of your next turn.
