# Ally's Shelter  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw while adjacent to one or more allies, but you haven't rolled yet.
- **Activity** Reaction

In stressful circumstances, you find strength in your allies' example. Roll the save using an adjacent ally's modifier for that type of saving throw instead of your own.
