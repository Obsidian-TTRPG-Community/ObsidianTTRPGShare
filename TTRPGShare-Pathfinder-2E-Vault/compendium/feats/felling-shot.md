# Felling Shot  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Your ranged attacks can shoot an unprepared foe right out of the air. Make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon or a thrown weapon against a [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature. If the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) is a success and deals damage, the target must attempt a Reflex save against your class DC with the following effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target falls up to 120 feet. If it hits the ground, it takes no damage from the fall.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target can't fly, jump, levitate, or otherwise leave the ground until the end of your next turn.
