# Necromantic Resistance  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Slayer Dedication](undead-slayer-dedication-botd.md)

As part of your training, you've inured yourself against necromancy through grueling, repeated exposure. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md) effects and gain resistance to negative damage equal to half your level.
