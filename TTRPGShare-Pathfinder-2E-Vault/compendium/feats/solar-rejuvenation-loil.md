# Solar Rejuvenation  *Feat 9*  
[ghoran](../../rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md)  


The warmth and light of the sun gives you life. If you rest outdoors for 10 minutes during the day, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. You gain this benefit in addition to any healing from [Treat Wounds](../../rules/actions/treat-wounds.md).
