# Hellspawn  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [tiefling](../../rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


Your lineage descends from [devils](../../rules/traits/devil.md), the conniving schemers of Hell's malevolent hierarchy. You're as skilled at noticing lies and twisted wordings as you are at constructing them. You are trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) and [Legal Lore](../skills.md#Lore). If you were already trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [Lie to Me](lie-to-me.md) skill feat.

## Hellspawn leads to...
