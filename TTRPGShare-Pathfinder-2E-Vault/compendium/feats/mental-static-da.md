# Mental Static  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md)  [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Trigger** You roll a critical success on a Will save against a [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect from a creature.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your thoughts sting back when a lesser mind tries to invade your own. You deal mental damage equal to your level to the triggering creature. If you so desire, you can also send the creature a single mental image to coincide with the damage, such as a watchful eye or the dread of floating in an infinite sea.
