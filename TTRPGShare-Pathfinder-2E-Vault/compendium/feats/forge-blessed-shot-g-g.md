# Forge-blessed Shot  [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 17*  
[divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [dwarf](../../rules/traits/dwarf.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.
- **Prerequisites**: worshipper of [Torag](../setting/deities/torag.md) or [Angradd](../setting/deities/angradd-logm.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You attempt a ranged [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

You intone a prayer to the dwarven deities [Torag](../setting/deities/torag.md) or [Angradd](../setting/deities/angradd-logm.md), willing a higher power to guide your aim in the heat of battle. On your next [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon before the end of your turn, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your attack roll and ignore your target's [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition, as well as your target's lesser, standard, and greater cover.
