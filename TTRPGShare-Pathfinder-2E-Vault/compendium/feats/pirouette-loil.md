# Pirouette  [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [rogue](../../rules/traits/rogue.md)  [swashbuckler](../../rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Masquerade of Seasons Stance
- **Trigger** An enemy targets you with a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Requirements**: You're in Masquerade of Seasons Stance.
- **Activity** Reaction

You twirl gracefully, spinning on one foot to evade your opponent's attack. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses you, you can immediately [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md). If the attack hits you anyway, reduce the damage it deals by an amount equal to half your level; this reduction in damage is applied after calculating immunities, resistances, and weakness.
