# Improved Twin Riposte (Ranger)  *Feat 16*  
[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Twin Riposte

At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to perform a Twin Riposte against your hunted prey. You can use this extra reaction even if you are not benefiting from [Twin Parry](twin-parry-fighter.md).
