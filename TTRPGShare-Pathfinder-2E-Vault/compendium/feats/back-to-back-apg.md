# Back To Back  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](marshal-dedication-apg.md)

You excel at watching your allies' backs and helping them watch yours. As long as you and an ally are adjacent to each other, neither of you can become [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) due to flanking unless both of you are flanked. If you're adjacent to more than one ally, all eligible allies can benefit at a given time. The benefit is negated for everyone if at least you and any one eligible ally are flanked, but not if your allies are flanked and you aren't.
