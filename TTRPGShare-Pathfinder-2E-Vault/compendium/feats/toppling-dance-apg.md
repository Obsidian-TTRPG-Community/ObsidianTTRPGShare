# Toppling Dance  *Feat 13*  
[halfling](../../rules/traits/halfling.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dance Underfoot](dance-underfoot-apg.md)

While sharing a creature's space using Dance Underfoot, your weapons and unarmed attacks gain the [trip](../../rules/traits/trip.md) trait, but only against the creature whose space you share. You can be in the same space as a Large or larger [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone) creature, even if it's not your ally.
