# Lifeblood's Call  *Feat 13*  
[orc](../../rules/traits/orc.md)  


The impulse to survive and continue fighting resonates deep within you. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage rolls on your melee [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) equal to twice the sum of your [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) and [doomed](../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) conditions (to a maximum of a +8 circumstance bonus to damage) whenever you have one or both conditions.
