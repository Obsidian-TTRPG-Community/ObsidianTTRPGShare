# Channel The Godmind  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[aphorite](../../rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You tap into the Godmind's collective cognitive well, rapidly parsing near-infinite variables to read your surroundings. For 1 minute, you gain precise motion sense out to 60 feet, you can see [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures and objects, and you gain the effects of a 9th-level [true seeing](../spells/true-seeing.md).
