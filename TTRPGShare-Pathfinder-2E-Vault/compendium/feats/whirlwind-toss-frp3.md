# Whirlwind Toss  *Feat 20*  
[barbarian](../../rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Collateral Thrash](collateral-thrash.md)
- **Requirements**: You have a foe [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).

You whirl a foe to smash into all nearby creatures before throwing them far away in imitation of the techniques of your rival, Ran-To. You Thrash. During this Thrash, your Collateral Thrash feat applies to all foes adjacent to you.

You can then throw the [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) creature 10 feet, where they fall [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).

If the foe you choose for Collateral Thrash is also adjacent to you, they attempt only one save and take the damage only once.
