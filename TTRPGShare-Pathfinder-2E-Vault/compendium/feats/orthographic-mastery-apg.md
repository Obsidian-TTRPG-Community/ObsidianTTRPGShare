[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Loremaster Dedication](loremaster-dedication-apg.md)

You understand the principles that underlie all written words, allowing you to read nearly any text. You can attempt to [Decipher Writing](../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md) using [Loremaster Lore](../skills.md#Lore) in place of the required skill.
