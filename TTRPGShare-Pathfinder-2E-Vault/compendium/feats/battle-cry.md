# Battle Cry  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation)

When you roll initiative, you can yell a mighty battle cry and [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) an [observed](../../rules/conditions.md#Observed) foe as a free action. If you're legendary in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation), you can use a reaction to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) your foe when you critically succeed at an attack roll.
