# Ceremony Of The Evened Hand  *Feat 1*  
[conrasu](../../rules/traits/conrasu-loag.md)  


You have cultivated your exoskeleton's form for close combat, using knots, whorls, and reinforced branches. When you select this feat, you gain a claws unarmed attack that deals `1d4` slashing damage and has the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) and [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md) traits or a branch unarmed attack that deals `1d6` bludgeoning damage and has the [backswing](../../rules/traits/backswing.md) trait. Each of these unarmed attacks is in the brawling weapon group and uses one of your hands.

**Special.** You can select this feat twice, choosing the other unarmed attack the second time you take it.
