# Sickening Bite  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghoul Dedication](ghoul-dedication-botd.md)

Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened). This is a [disease](../../rules/traits/disease.md) effect. If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a regular hit instead.
