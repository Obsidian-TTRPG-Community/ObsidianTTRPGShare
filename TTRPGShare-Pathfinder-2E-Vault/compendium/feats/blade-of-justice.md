# Blade Of Justice  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good
- **Activity** Two-Action

You call upon divine power and make a weapon or unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe you have witnessed harming an ally or innocent. The [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deals two extra weapon damage dice if the target of your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) is evil. Whether or not the target is [evil](../../rules/traits/evil.md), you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into good damage, and if you are a paladin, the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) applies all effects that normally apply on a [Retributive Strike](../../rules/actions/retributive-strike.md) (such as divine smite|Champion||Paladin||9).
