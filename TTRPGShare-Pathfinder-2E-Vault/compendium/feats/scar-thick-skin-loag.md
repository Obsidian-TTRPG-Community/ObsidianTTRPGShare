# Scar-thick Skin  *Feat 5*  
[orc](../../rules/traits/orc.md)  


Glorious, storied scars cover and protect much of your body. Your DC on flat checks to end [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is reduced from 15 to 10, or from 10 to 5 after receiving especially appropriate assistance.
