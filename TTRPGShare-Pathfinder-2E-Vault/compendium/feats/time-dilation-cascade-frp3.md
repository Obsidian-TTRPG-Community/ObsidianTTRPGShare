# Time Dilation Cascade  [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 20*  
[flourish](../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  [ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Activity** Three-Action

You borrow a bit of time from the future to act now. Make six [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md). Your multiple attack penalty applies normally to these [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you successfully hit a creature with multiple [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md), combine those [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md)' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. On your next turn, you regain 1 action instead of 3. This is before any alteration in your actions due to the [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened), [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed), and [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) conditions.
