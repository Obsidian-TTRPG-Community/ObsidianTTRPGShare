# Aura Of Despair  *Feat 4*  
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil

Your presence as an avatar of evil makes your foes more susceptible to terror and makes it almost impossible for them to shake off fear when you are near. Enemies within 15 feet of you take a –1 circumstance penalty to saving throws against [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md). In addition, an enemy that ends its turn within 15 feet of you can't reduce the value of its [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition below 1.
