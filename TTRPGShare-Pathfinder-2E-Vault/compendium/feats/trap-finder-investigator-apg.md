# Trap Finder (Investigator)  *Feat 1*  
[investigator](../../rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  


You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren't [Searching](../../rules/actions/search.md), you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be [Searching](../../rules/actions/search.md). You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.

You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery). If you have master proficiency in [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery), you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increase to +2.
