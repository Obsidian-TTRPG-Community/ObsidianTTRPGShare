# Sap Life  *Feat 2*  
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md)  


You draw the life force out of your enemies to heal your own wounds. When you cast a [harm](../spells/harm.md) spell and damage at least one living creature, you regain Hit Points equal to the spell level of your [harm](../spells/harm.md) spell. If you aren't a living creature, you gain no benefit from this feat.
