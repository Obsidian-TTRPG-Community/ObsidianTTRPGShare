# Emergency Medical Assistance  [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [skill](../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](swordmaster-dedication-locg.md), master in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: An adjacent ally is suffering [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've learned a variety of methods for helping allies who are bleeding, burning, or otherwise suffering [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), from brushing off acid to patting down fires.

Your ally immediately attempts a flat check to remove all types of [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and your use of this feat automatically counts as especially effective aid, reducing the DC from 15 to 10 for all future flat checks to remove the [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
