[gnome](../../rules/traits/gnome.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You blind or dazzle a creature.
- **Activity** Free Action

You've spent considerable time practicing the manipulation of light, weaponizing your blade's reflection or bolstering the luminosity of magical displays to unconventional heights. Extend the duration of the [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) condition you give the target by 1 round.
