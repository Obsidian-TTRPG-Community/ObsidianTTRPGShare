# Dragon Stance  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes like a lashing dragon's tail. You can make dragon tail attacks that deal `1d10` bludgeoning damage. They are in the brawling group and have the [backswing](../../rules/traits/backswing.md), [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of difficult terrain while [Striding](../../rules/actions/stride.md).

## Dragon Stance leads to...

[Dragon Roar](dragon-roar.md)
