# Combat Premonition  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)

By narrowing your sense of the future, you can improve that of your allies. When you roll initiative, instead of stabilizing or destabilizing your own timestream, you can grant your allies a flash of insight into their future. Choose two allies. Those allies roll their initiative roll twice and take the better result; this is a [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect. You roll your initiative roll twice and take the worse result; this is a [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect. The two effects are tied together: if you would avoid the [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect for any reason, or if any of your allies would negate their [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect, your Combat Premonition does nothing.
