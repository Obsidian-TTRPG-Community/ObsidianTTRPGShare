[ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: an animal companion

You can urge your companion to do its utmost. You can spend 2 actions to [Command an Animal](../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) instead of 1 when commanding your animal companion. If you do, your animal companion uses an additional action.
