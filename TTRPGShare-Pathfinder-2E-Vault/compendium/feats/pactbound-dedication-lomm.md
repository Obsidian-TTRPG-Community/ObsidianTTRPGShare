# Pactbound Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Erutaki or Giant language, trained in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), must have earned the trust of a saumen kar who initiates you into the archetype

You befriended one of the last saumen kar and were infused with a fraction of their power, granting you the potential to become a guardian of their ancient pact. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level. You can [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) while it's snowing even lightly, even if it wouldn't be thick enough to normally grant [concealment](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed). Finally, all saumen kar can sense the mark of their pact upon you, and their attitude toward you is typically one step better than it would be otherwise ([hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) to [unfriendly](../../rules/conditions.md#Unfriendly), [unfriendly](../../rules/conditions.md#Unfriendly) to [indifferent](../../rules/conditions.md#Indifferent), etc.) Most saumen kar are [unfriendly](../../rules/conditions.md#Unfriendly) to outsiders; this would make them [indifferent](../../rules/conditions.md#Indifferent) to you.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the pactbound archetype.

## Pactbound Dedication leads to...
