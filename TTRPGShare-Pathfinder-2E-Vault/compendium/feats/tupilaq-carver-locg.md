# Tupilaq Carver  *Feat 1*  
[human](../../rules/traits/human.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Erutaki ethnicity
- **Prerequisites**: You have a spellcasting class feature with the divine or primal tradition

You know the truth behind old stories that tell of sending a fetish of bone and sinew to seek vengeance. These old magics allow you to conjure constructs with ease.

Add the [summon construct](../spells/summon-construct.md) spell to your spell list. The constructs you summon have a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body as part of the spell's material component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to sense or locate that creature.
