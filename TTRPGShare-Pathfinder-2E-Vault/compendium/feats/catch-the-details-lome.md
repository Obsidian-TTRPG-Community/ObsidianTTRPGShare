# Catch The Details  *Feat 1*  
[goloma](../../rules/traits/goloma-lome.md)  


You are quick at recognizing broad details about people and things around you. You are trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society) and gain the [Eye for Numbers](eye-for-numbers-apg.md) skill feat (Advanced Player's Guide 206)

If you would automatically become trained in [Society](../skills.md#Society) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
