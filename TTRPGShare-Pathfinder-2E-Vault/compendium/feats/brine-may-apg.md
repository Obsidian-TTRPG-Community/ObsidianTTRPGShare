# Brine May  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](../../rules/traits/changeling-b1.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


Your mother was a sea hag, granting you one sea-green or blue eye. You find comfort both in the sea and on the shore.

Whenever you roll a success on an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md), you get a critical success instead. If you end your turn in water without having succeeded at a [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md) action that round, you don't sink (but you might still be moved by the current).

## Brine May leads to...

[Invoke The Elements](invoke-the-elements-loag.md), [Stormy Heart](stormy-heart-loag.md)
