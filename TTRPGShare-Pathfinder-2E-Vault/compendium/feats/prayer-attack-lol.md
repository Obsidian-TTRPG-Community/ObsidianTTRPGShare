# Prayer Attack  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Red Mantis Assassin Dedication](red-mantis-assassin-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a sawtooth saber in each hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You've mastered the signature assassination style of the Red Mantis. Attempt to [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md) an enemy within 30 feet. If your [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md) is successful, when you use Prayer Attack on subsequent turns you automatically make the target [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your melee attacks for that turn without rolling a check to [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md), so as long as you remain visible to the target and the target remains within 30 feet of you. If you use your Prayer Attack against a different target, you must attempt to [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md) the target normally.

When you use Prayer Attack, your next successful [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a sawtooth saber that turn deals `2d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to the target.
