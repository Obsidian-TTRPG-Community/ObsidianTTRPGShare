# Grovel  [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [kobold](../../rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)
- **Activity** Single Action

With obsequious words and begging gestures, you convince your foe you're less of a threat. You attempt to [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md) against a creature. Unlike a normal [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md), the creature can be within 30 feet instead of in your melee reach, and you make your check against its Will DC instead of its [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC.
