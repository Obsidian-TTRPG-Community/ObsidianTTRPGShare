# Shadow Sneak Attack  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shadowdancer Dedication](shadowdancer-dedication-apg.md)

You gain the sneak attack|rogue|crb|1 class feature, except you deal `1d6` precision damage regardless of your level.

Sneak attack|rogue|crb|1 from multiple sources isn't cumulative. If you have sneak attack|rogue|crb|1 from more than one source, use only the highest number of dice when you sneak attack rather than adding the amounts together.
