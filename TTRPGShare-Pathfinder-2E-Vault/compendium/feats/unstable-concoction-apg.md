# Unstable Concoction  *Feat 10*  
[alchemist](../../rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


You can create extraordinary—albeit volatile—alchemical wonders, though they have an unfortunate tendency to violently explode when you use them. When you use [Quick Alchemy](../../rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md), you can create an alchemical item from your formula book whose level is up to 2 higher than your advanced alchemy level. You can spend up to 3 additional batches of infused reagents when creating this item to stabilize it. Upon activating the item, attempt a DC 10 flat check; for every additional batch of infused reagents you spent to create the item, reduce this DC by 2. On a success, the item functions normally. On a failure, the item explodes, dealing force damage to the user equal to twice the item's level (doubled on a critical failure).
