# Improved Knockdown  *Feat 10*  
[fighter](../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knockdown](knockdown.md)

You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. When you use Knockdown, instead of making a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) followed by a [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md), you can attempt a single [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you do and your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits, instead of rolling a check for your [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md) attempt, you also apply the critical success effect of a [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md). If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), you can use the weapon's damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md).
