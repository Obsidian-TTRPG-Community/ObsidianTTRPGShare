# Veil May  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](../../rules/traits/changeling-b1.md)  [lineage](../../rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


Born of a blood hag, a fiery blood drinker [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) behind a false skin, you have one blood-red eye and the ability to slough off your appearance in an instant. You gain the [Lie to Me](lie-to-me.md) skill feat, and you can shed a disguise quickly by peeling off the outer layer of your skin. Changing from a disguise used to [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) back to your true appearance is a 3-action activity for you; if you're an expert in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), it's a 2-action activity, and if you're legendary in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), it takes only a single action. This doesn't allow you to don or remove armor or other equipment any faster, but your physical appearance otherwise returns to its normal state.

## Veil May leads to...

[Invoke The Elements](invoke-the-elements-loag.md), [Stormy Heart](stormy-heart-loag.md)
