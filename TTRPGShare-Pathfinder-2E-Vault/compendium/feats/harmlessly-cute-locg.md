Your size and demeanor make it easy for you to convince others that you mean no harm. You gain the [Shameless Request](shameless-request.md) skill feat as a bonus feat. Additionally, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative checks when you roll [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) for initiative.
