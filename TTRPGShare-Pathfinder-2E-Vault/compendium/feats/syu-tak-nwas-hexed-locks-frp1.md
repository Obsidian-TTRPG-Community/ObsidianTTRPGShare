# Syu Tak-nwa's Hexed Locks  *Feat 8*  
[uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [witch](../../rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Living Hair](living-hair-apg.md)

Your hair unarmed attack gains the [reach](../../rules/traits/reach.md) trait. You can deliver hexes through your hair.

When you successfully cast a hex focus spell that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a hair [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the foe before applying [any](../../rules/traits/any-b1.md) effects of the hex. If this [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) misses, the hex has no effect.
