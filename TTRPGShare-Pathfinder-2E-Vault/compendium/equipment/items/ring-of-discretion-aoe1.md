This ring magically conceals any armor and sheathed weapons you're wearing by either turning them [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) or creating the illusion of ordinary clothes. The ring doesn't change your appearance beyond concealing weapons and armor. As soon as you wield a weapon, the weapon becomes obvious to onlookers and is no longer affected by the ring until you sheathe the weapon for at least 1 minute. A creature can 0 by Seeking or any time it hits you with an attack.
