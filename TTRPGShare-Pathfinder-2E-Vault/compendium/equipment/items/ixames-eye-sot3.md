Via some strange alchemical reaction with the gasses of Terwa Lake, the cloud dragon Ixamè's eyeballs have shriveled into sky-blue gems.

The dragon's sense of vision isn't impaired, and her eyes can't be removed from her head until she's destroyed.

Once removed, each gem functions as a special talisman. Ixamè's eye sparkles when it's in an area of fog or mist. Activating the talisman enables you to see clearly through fog and mist for 1 minute; any creature [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) only by fog or mist is no longer [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to you. If such a creature was relying on the concealment to [Hide](../../../rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../../rules/actions/sneak.md), this also means it's no longer [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](../../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected).
