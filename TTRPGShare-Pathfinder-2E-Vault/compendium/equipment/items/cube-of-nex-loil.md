# Cube of Nex *Item 25*  
[artifact](../../../rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [unique](../../../rules/traits/unique.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Category** Artifact

The Cube of Nex acts as a [Lesser Cube of Nex](lesser-cube-of-nex-loil.md) except it suppresses all magic within 5 feet of it with the effects of a 10th-level antimagic field spell, instead of just one school. However, spells you cast and magic items you wield ignore the [antimagic field](../../spells/antimagic-field.md) from the Cube of Nex.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

A [cube of force](../../../compendium/equipment/items/cube-of-force-loil.md) or [Lesser Cube of Nex](../../../compendium/equipment/items/lesser-cube-of-nex-loil.md) within 60 feet of you becomes inert. It can't be Activated, any current activation ends, and any constant abilities it has cease to function.
