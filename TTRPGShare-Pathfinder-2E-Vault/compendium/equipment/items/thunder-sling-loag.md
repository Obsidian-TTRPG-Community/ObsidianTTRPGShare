Tengu use these specialized slings to fire darts further and with greater force than when thrown by hand, which is particularly effective when attacking from great heights. A thunder sling uses [darts](dart.md) as ammunition. It can also hurl [blowgun darts](blowgun-dart.md) as ammunition but deals `1d4` piercing damage instead of `1d6` when used this way.
