The gleaming holy avenger is the iconic weapon of powerful paladins. The crossbar of this +2 greater striking holy cold iron longsword is styled to look like angel wings.

Tradition holds that those who see their reflection in a holy avenger's highly polished blade have their faults laid bare. If you are evil, you are [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) while carrying or wielding this weapon.

title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You command the sword and point it at a creature you can see. The sword casts detect alignment to detect evil, but this targets only the selected creature instead of detecting in an area.

Paladin Wielder If you're a champion of the paladin cause, you also gain the following two benefits.

- When you critically hit an evil creature with the holy avenger, the creature is [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) and [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.
- You can activate the sword in the following way.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Requirements**: You hit a creature using the holy avenger on your previous action

**Effect** You cast [dispel magic](../../../compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) at the same level as your champion focus spells. It must target an illusion the creature you hit created, a spell affecting the creature you hit, or an item the creature you hit wears or carries. The spell or item you attempt to counteract must be within 120 feet of you.
