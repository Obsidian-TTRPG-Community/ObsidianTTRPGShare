# Carrion Cask *Item 8*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)

This stylized, palm-sized box contains a black, ooze-like substance that can easily devour a corpse in moments, breaking the body down into a necromantic sludge.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You feed a corpse of a Small-sized or larger creature to the cask, little by little. The activation requires a three-action activity for a Small or Medium creature, a 1-minute activity for a Larger creature, and a 10-minute activity for a Huge creature. A Gargantuan creature is too large for the cask to devour.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

- **Requirements**: The carrion cask has consumed a corpse since the last time it was activated

**Effect** You release the sludge from the carrion cask's last meal in a pulse of necromantic energy. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take `6d6` negative damage, with a DC 24 basic Fortitude save.
```
