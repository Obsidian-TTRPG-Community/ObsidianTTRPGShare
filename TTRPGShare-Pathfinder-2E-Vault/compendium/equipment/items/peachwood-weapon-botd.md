# Peachwood Weapon *Item 12+*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon

Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight.

Peachwood is treated as darkwood for any undead creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to darkwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a jiang-shi's resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standardgrade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.
