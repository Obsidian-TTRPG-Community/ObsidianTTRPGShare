# Staff of Fire *Item 3+*  
[evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [staff](../../../rules/traits/staff.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Staff

This staff resembles a blackened and burned length of ashen wood. It smells faintly of soot and glows as if lit by embers.

You can use an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to touch the tip of this staff to a torch, tinder, or a flammable substance to ignite a flame.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
