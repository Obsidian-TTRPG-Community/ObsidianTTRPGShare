The guard of this +1 striking main-gauche is inscribed with eldritch glyphs that guard against magic. When you are benefiting from the +1 circumstance bonus to AC from this weapon's [parry](../../../rules/traits/parry.md) trait, you also apply that circumstance bonus to your saving throws against spells that target you.
