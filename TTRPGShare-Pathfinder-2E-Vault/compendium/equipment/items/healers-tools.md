This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) checks to [Administer First Aid](../../../rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md), [Treat Disease](../../../rules/actions/treat-disease.md), [Treat Poison](../../../rules/actions/treat-poison.md), or [Treat Wounds](../../../rules/actions/treat-wounds.md). If you wear your healer's tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.
