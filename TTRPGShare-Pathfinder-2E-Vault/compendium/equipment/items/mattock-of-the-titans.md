# Mattock of the Titans *Item 19*  
[evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 36000 gp
- **Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 16
- **Category** Weapon

This 15-foot-long adamantine digging tool is far too big for even a Large creature to wield, though if you're a Small or larger creature, you can wield it while wearing a belt of giant strength, as though it were appropriately sized for you and had 2 Bulk. The GM might also allow you to wield the mattock if you have some other means of wielding oversized weapons, such as if you're a Large barbarian with the giant instinct or are a Huge creature. When it's used as a weapon, the mattock of the titans has the statistics of a +3 greater striking keen adamantine great pick.

While you're wielding the mattock of the titans, you gain a +3 item bonus to [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks. You can use it to loosen or push soft earth at a rate of 1 minute per 5-foot cube or smash through solid stone at the rate of 5 minutes per 5-foot-cube.

You dig furiously with the mattock to non-magically replicate the effects of an [earthquake](../../../compendium/spells/earthquake.md) spell.
