A classical weapon of Irrisenis who lacked magical talent, the sickle-saber has seen a resurgence since the coronation of Queen Anastasia. The queen was fascinated with the sickle-sabers in the palace treasury, and now the unusual blades are carried by her honor guard and Irriseni diplomats alike. The sickle-saber's blade curves multiple times along its 4-foot length, and its hilt is similarly curved. A small, secondary grip on the blade lets the wielder rapidly and unpredictably twist the cutting edges. Characters from Irrisen have access to the sickle-saber.
