# Fake Blood Pack *Item 0*  
[consumable](../../../rules/traits/consumable.md)  

- **Price** 1 gp
- **Usage** worn under light armor or clothes; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Consumable

Adventurers have found a number of uses for these animal blood–filled bladders, which were originally used in theatrical productions. Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage with the fake blood pack under your clothes or armor, roll a DC 11 flat check. On a success, the blood pack is punctured.

You or an ally can puncture the [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) pack intentionally.

When faking an injury, the blood pack grants a +2 item bonus to relevant [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) checks, such as to [Lie](../../../rules/actions/lie.md) about being injured. Abilities that trigger when a creature deals bleed damage, determine if a creature is bleeding, or are otherwise based on bleed damage don't trigger or apply for blood from a fake blood pack, which might mean creatures with such abilities automatically realize the ruse.
