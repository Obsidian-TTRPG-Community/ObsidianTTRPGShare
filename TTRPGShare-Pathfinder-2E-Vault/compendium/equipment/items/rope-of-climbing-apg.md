title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You hold one end of the rope and point to a destination.

The rope animates for 1 minute, moving 10 feet per round until it reaches the destination or runs out of length. The rope can move across any non-damaging horizontal or vertical surface, but it can't extend upward without a surface to support it. At any point while the rope is animated, you can use an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to wiggle the rope, giving it one of the following commands: stop in place, fasten securely to the nearest available object, detach from an object, or knot or unknot itself.
