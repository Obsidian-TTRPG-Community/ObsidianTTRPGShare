These simple lenses are alchemically treated to detect the faint smoke trail from a piece of specially formulated sandalwood incense. This incense has an odor undetectable by most people and a long burn time, making it perfect for discreetly tracking individuals. A stick of this incense costs 1 sp and can safely burn for up to 8 hours. While wearing the lenses, you see alchemical fumes in a distinct green tint, granting you a +1 item bonus to [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) checks to [Track](../../../rules/actions/track.md) a creature marked with the incense and to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) any alchemical vapors. If the smoke is fresh, [Tracking](../../../rules/actions/track.md) via the incense's fumes might use a lower DC than normal for tracking a creature walking on firm surfaces.
