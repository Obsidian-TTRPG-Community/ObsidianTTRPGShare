- **Trigger**: You damage a creature with a pacifying weapon

**Effect** The damaged creature must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be pacified. A pacified creature takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls on any attacks that aren't nonlethal for 1 minute, and the creature also experiences a clear psychic warning that they should stop dealing lethal damage.
