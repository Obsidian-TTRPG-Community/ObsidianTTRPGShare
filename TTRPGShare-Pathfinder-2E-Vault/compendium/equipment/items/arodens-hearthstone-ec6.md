- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

This coin-sized gemstone can be used on its own but must be included in the construction of a hearth in order to fully activate its magic.

title: Activate [⏲](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency")

- **Requirements**: You have Legendary proficiency in [Crafting](../../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

**Effect** You craft a magical weapon or armor of up to 20th level. You must attempt a [Crafting](../../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check as usual to create the item, but you need supply only raw materials worth a quarter of the item's Price, and you need not pay the remaining portion of the item's Price or spend additional downtime days working on it. While Aroden's Hearthstone is active, the stars in the sky, including Golarion's sun, appear to glow brighter within a 100-mile radius of the hearthstone.

Aroden's Hearthstone draws in heat from the world itself, causing the ambient temperature within 100 miles to drop below 0°F.

Within 1 mile of the Hearthstone, the temperature drops to –200°F, rivaling the frigid cold of outer space and dealing `4d6` cold damage each round to every creature in the area. This effect lasts 1 minute, during which time the nearest moon (probably Golarion's) appears an eerie blue color to any observers within 100 miles of the hearthstone. At the end of 1 minute, the hearthstone emits a blast of concentrated heat that deals `25d6` fire damage to creatures and objects within 150 feet.
