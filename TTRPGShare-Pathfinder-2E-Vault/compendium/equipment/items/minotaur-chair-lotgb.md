A minotaur chair is a traveler's chair with chair storage, impulse control (see below), and +1 striking wounding wheel spikes (page 72). The wheel spikes can have runes upgraded, transferred, or added as normal. The chair magically stores the kinetic energy from movement throughout the day, allowing you to expend it to make a powerful rushing charge.

[Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) in a straight line, moving through enemies' spaces and making an attack with the wheel spikes against every foe in the line.
