This root is often infused into bandages for life-threatening bleeding. [Activating the item](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) is part of the same activity you use to [Administer First Aid](../../../rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) to stop bleeding on a creature who's also [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying). When you do, you can [Administer First Aid](../../../rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) to stop bleeding and [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) as part of the same activity with only one [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) check. However, the DC for the [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) check is equal to the 5 + the higher of the two DCs to [Administer First Aid](../../../rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md).
