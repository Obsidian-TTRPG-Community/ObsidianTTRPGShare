This thick leather belt is decorated with a buckle carved from glittering quartz in the shape of a fist. You gain a +3 item bonus to [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks to lift a heavy object, [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md), and [Force Open](../../../rules/actions/force-open.md). When you invest the belt, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

- **Trigger**: You are targeted by a thrown rock attack, or a rock would fall on you

**Effect** Attempt an [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to grab the triggering rock. Use the [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) DC of the creature throwing the rock, the DC of the hazard or other effect, or DC 35 if no other DC is applicable. You must have a free hand to catch the rock, but you can [Release](../../../rules/actions/release.md) anything you're holding in a hand as part of this reaction.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You safely catch the rock, take no damage, and are now holding the rock.
> - **Failure** You take half damage.
> - **Critical Failure** You take full damage.
