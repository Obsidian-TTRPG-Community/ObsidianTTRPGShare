A glass tube of mercury is contained within this golden clasp that's fitted in front of a firearm's trigger. On the triggering [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), the mercury turns briefly to gold, reducing the effect of recoil, allowing you to ignore the circumstance penalty of the attached weapon's kickback weapon trait.
