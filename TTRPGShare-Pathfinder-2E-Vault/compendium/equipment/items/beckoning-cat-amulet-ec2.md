# Beckoning Cat Amulet *Item 5*  
[consumable](../../../rules/traits/consumable.md)  [divination](../../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [talisman](../../../rules/traits/talisman.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 26 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You use a feat or ability to reroll a failed or critically failed Reflex saving throw (such as [Cat's Luck](../../feats/cats-luck-apg.md) or [Halfling Luck](../../feats/halfling-luck.md))
- **Category** Talisman

This clay figurine resembles a white cat with a paw outstretched. When it's activated, any allies within 10 feet who also just failed or critically failed a Reflex saving throw from the same source (such as a [fireball](../../spells/fireball.md) spell) can also reroll their saving throw and use the better result.
