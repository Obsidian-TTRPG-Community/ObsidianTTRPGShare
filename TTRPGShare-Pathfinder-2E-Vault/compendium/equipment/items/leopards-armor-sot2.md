# Leopard's Armor *Item 9*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 700 gp
- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 2
- **Category** Armor

Made of cobalt-colored steel rings that flow down the entire length of the garment, this +1 resilient chain mail includes an armored face covering. The armor is said to be based on the same armor once worn by Azure Leopard, one of Old-Mage Jatembe's magic warriors.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You call upon the ferocity and grace of the leopard. The armor's rings flatten out to become a solid piece of flexible armor. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks and [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md), but take a –2 penalty to [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Society](../../../compendium/skills.md#Society) checks.

This lasts for 1 hour, but you can Activate the armor again to revert it back to its original form.
```
