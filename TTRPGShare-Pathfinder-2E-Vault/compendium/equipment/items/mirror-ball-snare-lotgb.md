A mixture of metal shavings and flash powder inside this small, mirrored sphere ignites when disturbed, causing the ball to flash and spin. When a creature enters the square, the ball pops into the air, and all creatures within 10 feet who can see the mirror ball must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or become [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. On a critical failure, affected creatures are instead [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
