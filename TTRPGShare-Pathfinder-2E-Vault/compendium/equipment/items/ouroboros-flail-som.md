# Ouroboros Flail *Item 14+*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 2
- **Category** Held

You can easily expand and contract the chain of this +2 greater striking [extending](extending-som.md) [war flail](war-flail.md).

It magically grows new links when extended and loses them when contracted.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You successfully [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the flail while activating its [extending](../../../compendium/equipment/items/extending-som.md) rune

**Effect** The head of the flail wraps around the target of the triggering [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) and drags it in your direction. The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or be pulled adjacent to you. A creature pulled in is then [grabbed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) by the flail until the end of your next turn unless you move, your target [Escapes](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) (DC 31), or you use the flail.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

You extend the flail's chain, then wrap it across itself and strike two links together.

This severs a usable 60-foot loop of chain from the flail, which instantly returns to its normal length. If you use this activation again, any previous chain you created with it disappears after 1 round. As with most obviously magical and temporary constructs, the chain cannot be sold.
