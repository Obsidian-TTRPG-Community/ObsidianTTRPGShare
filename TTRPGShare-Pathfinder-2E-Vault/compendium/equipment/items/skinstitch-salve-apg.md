You [Administer First Aid](../../../rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) without requiring healer's tools. You either gain a +2 item bonus to the [Medicine](../../../compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check, or you can use the skinstitch salve's [Medicine](../../../compendium/skills.md#Medicine) modifier of +13 instead of your own.
```

- **Trigger**: You [Treat Wounds](../../../rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) or use Battle
