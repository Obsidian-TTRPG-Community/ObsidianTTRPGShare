This trident is made of an ancient black metal that glistens unnaturally and is cold to the touch. The prongs of this trident drip with metallic lake water. Strikes with the Devil's Trident trigger the weaknesses of any creature with a weakness to water.

The trident casts 3rd-level [quench](../../../compendium/spells/quench-apg.md) with a DC of 25 and a counteract modifier of +15. You can [Sustain the Spell](../../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) as normal.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

You call upon the corrupted power of the trident to stay a foe. Attempt a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, the trident casts 3rd-level [paralyze](../../../compendium/spells/paralyze.md) on the target (DC 25). If the Strike was a critical hit, the target is [stunned](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) even if it critically succeeds at the save.
