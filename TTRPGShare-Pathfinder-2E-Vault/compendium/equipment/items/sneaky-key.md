# Sneaky Key *Item 5*  
[consumable](../../../rules/traits/consumable.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [talisman](../../../rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 22 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md); **Requirements** You are an expert in [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery).
- **Category** Talisman

This small silver skeleton key can be pinned to armor or a sleeve. When you turn the key to activate it, for the next minute, if the outcome of any your attempts to [Pick a Lock](../../../rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md) is a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
