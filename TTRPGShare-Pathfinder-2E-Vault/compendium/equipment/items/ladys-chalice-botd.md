This silver chalice bears the symbol of [Pharasma](../../setting/deities/pharasma.md), a swirling cloud that transforms into a flight of whippoorwills that encircle the top. The chalice can be activated in one of two ways, though only once per day total.

The chalice fills with a single vial's worth of holy water. The water loses its potency after 1 day if poured into any container other than a font specifically sanctified by a cleric of [Pharasma](../../../compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md). It similarly loses its potency 1 day after being removed from such a font.

- **Requirements**: The Lady's chalice is full of a vial's worth of holy water

**Effect** The chalice splashes a spiral of holy water into an adjacent space. This is a simple thrown weapon with a range of 5 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait to the attack made with it. If it hits, it deals `2d6` good damage and 2 good splash damage (including to you, if you're evil).
