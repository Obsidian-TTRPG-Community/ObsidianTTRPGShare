[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto armor
- **Category** Rune

This property makes armor slippery, as though it were coated with a thin film of oil. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) and [Squeeze](../../../rules/actions/squeeze.md).
