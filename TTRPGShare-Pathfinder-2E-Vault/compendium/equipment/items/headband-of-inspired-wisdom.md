title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

When you are considering a course of action, you get a gut feeling about whether it's a good idea. You gain the effects of an [augury](../../../compendium/spells/augury.md) spell, except that you receive the result from your own instincts rather than an external source.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You fail a saving throw against an effect that makes you [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused), [fascinated](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), or [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied)

**Effect** The headband of inspired wisdom clears your mind. You can reroll the saving throw and use the better result.
