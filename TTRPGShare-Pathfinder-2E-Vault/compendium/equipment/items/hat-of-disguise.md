- **Usage** worn headwear
- **Category** Worn

This ordinary-looking hat allows you to cloak yourself in illusions.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [⏲](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency")

The hat casts a 1st-level [illusory disguise](../../../compendium/spells/illusory-disguise.md) spell on you.

While setting up the disguise, you can magically alter the hat to appear as a comb, ribbon, helm, or other piece of headwear.
