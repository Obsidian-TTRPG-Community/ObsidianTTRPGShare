A scroll contains a single spell that you can cast without having to expend a spell slot. A scroll can be [Crafted](../../../rules/actions/craft.md) to contain nearly any spell, so the types of scrolls available are limited only by the number of spells in the game. The exceptions are cantrips, focus spells, and rituals, none of which can be put on scrolls. The spell on a scroll can be cast only once, and the scroll is destroyed as part of the casting. The spell on the scroll is cast at a particular spell level, as determined by the scroll. For instance, a scroll of [magic missile](../../spells/magic-missile.md) (1st level) can be used to cast the 1st-level version of [magic missile](../../spells/magic-missile.md), but not a [magic missile](../../spells/magic-missile.md) heightened to 2nd level. If no level is listed, the scroll can be used to cast the spell at its lowest level.

If you find a scroll, you can try to figure out what spell it contains. If the spell is a common spell from your spell list or a spell you know, you can spend a single [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action and automatically succeed at identifying the scroll's spell. If it's not, you must use [Identify Magic](../../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md) to learn what spell the scroll holds.

## Casting a Spell from a Scroll
<sup>CRB p. 564</sup>

[Casting a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one hand and activating it with a [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity using the normal number of actions for that spell.

To [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from a scroll, the spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one [Casting the Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), use your spell attack roll and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).

Any physical material components and costs are provided when a scroll is created, so you don't need to provide them when [Casting a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from a scroll. You must replace any required material component for that spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a focus, you must have that focus to [Cast the Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from a scroll.
