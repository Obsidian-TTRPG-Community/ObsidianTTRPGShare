This +1 striking returning dagger has an elaborate, gemmed handle and can be worn strapped to the inside of a wrist or tucked within a decorative bodice. Despite the name, which stems from the dagger's historical basis in Oppara as a lady's favor, this dagger is common among wielders of all genders and has become quite fashionable in Absalom of late, with most nobles who carry them matching their evening finery to the gems on the hilt.

You offer this weapon as a romantic or platonic favor to an ally. You and the ally become linked for 1 day. During this time, you each benefit from the effects of status, using each other as the targets.

title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You call forth the blade. The lady's knife instantly teleports to your hand. The attempt to recall the knife fails if you are more than 1 mile away from the knife's current location. Your linked ally can use the same Activation to recall the knife once per day as well.
