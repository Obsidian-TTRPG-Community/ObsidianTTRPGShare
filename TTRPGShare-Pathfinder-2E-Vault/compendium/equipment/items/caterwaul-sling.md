Made of shiny brown leather, this +1 striking sling has a single white thread interwoven into its cord.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")
[sonic](../../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  

You pull the white thread free, then whirl the sling in circles at high speed. It lets out an ear-piercing wave of sound.

Each creature in a 30-foot cone takes `4d6` sonic damage (DC 21 basic Fortitude save). Any creature that fails is [deafened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 round, or 1 hour on a critical failure.
