# Orichalcum *Item 17+*  
[precious](../../../rules/traits/precious.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Category** Material

The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery metal isn't as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum's time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn't destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.
