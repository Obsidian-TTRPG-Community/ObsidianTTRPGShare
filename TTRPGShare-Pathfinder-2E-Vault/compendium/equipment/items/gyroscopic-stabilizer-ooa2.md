# Gyroscopic Stabilizer *Item 4*  
[divination](../../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 115 gp
- **Usage** attached <to a two-handed firearm>; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Stabilizers

A gyroscopic stabilizer appears as a gold disk suspended within three rotating golden bands inside a gilded case, itself attached to a set of clamps. These clamps allow you to attach the gyroscopic stabilizer to any one-handed firearm as an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Requirements**: The gyroscopic stabilizer is attached to a one-handed firearm without the [fatal](../../../rules/traits/fatal.md) or [fatal aim](../../../rules/traits/fatal-aim-g-g.md) traits

**Effect** The gyroscopic stabilizer begins spinning for 1 minute. While the gyroscopic stabilizer is spinning, the weapon it's attached to gains the fatal aim weapon trait (Pathfinder Guns & Gears 232) with a die one size larger than its damage die (maximum d12). This allows you to wield it in two hands to grant it the [fatal](../../../rules/traits/fatal.md) trait.
