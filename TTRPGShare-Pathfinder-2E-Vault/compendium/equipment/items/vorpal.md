# Vorpal *Item 17*  
[evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a slashing melee weapon
- **Category** Rune

Originally created as a means of slaying the legendary jabberwock, vorpal weapons prove equally effective against nearly any foe with a head.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You roll a natural 20 on a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the weapon, critically succeed, and deal slashing damage.

**Effect** The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude save or be decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don't require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head.
```
