# Titan's Grasp *Item 18*

- **Price** 24000 gp
- **Usage** worn gloves; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Apex

These bronze gauntlets each have a small red gem embedded in the wrist. You gain a +3 item bonus to [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md). If you successfully [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md) an enemy that's at least one size category larger than you, the gauntlets dig into it, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier, plus an additional `2d6` on a critical success.

When you invest the gloves, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
