Each piece of stonethroat ammunition is tipped with an unusual yellow stone. When an activated piece of stonethroat ammunition hits a target, the target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The ammunition lodges itself loosely into the target's throat. For 1 round, the target takes a –2 status penalty to attack rolls with its jaws or fangs, and to [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks.
> - **Failure** The ammunition embeds itself deep in the target's throat. The target can't use its jaws or fangs [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) (if it has one) or the Swallow Whole ability until the end of its next turn.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.
