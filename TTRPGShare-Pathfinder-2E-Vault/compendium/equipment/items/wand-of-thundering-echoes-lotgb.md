title: Activate

You cast [sound burst](../../../compendium/spells/sound-burst.md) of the indicated level. After you [Cast the Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), at the start of each of your turns, the sound echoes in the same area as if you had cast it again, though it deals one fewer d10. This effect lasts until the damage is reduced to below `2d10`. The echoes don't affect structures or other items.
