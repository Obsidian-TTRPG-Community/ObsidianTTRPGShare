- **Category** Contract

You regain triple the normal number of Hit Points when resting (meaning you regain triple your Constitution modifier multiplied by your level). The healing you gain from long-term rest is similarly tripled. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can recite a voidability clause in your Thrune contract as a 1-minute activity to prevent you from regaining Hit Points from resting for 1 day.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You recite a subclause regarding mandatory remediation from your Thrune contract. For 6 rounds, at the start of your turn each round, you recover 25 Hit Points unless you took good damage since the start of your previous turn.
```
