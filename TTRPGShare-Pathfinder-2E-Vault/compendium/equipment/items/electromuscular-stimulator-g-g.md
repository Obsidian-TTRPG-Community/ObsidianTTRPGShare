When you [Activate](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) an attached electromuscular stimulator, roll a [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) check, using the [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) modifier of the creature who attached the stimulator to you, with a DC equal to the standard DC for your level.
