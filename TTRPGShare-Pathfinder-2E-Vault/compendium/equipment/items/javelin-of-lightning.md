This item looks like a normal javelin carved with lightning-bolt motifs. If thrown without being activated, it wobbles in the air and fails to strike true. When you **Activate** the javelin, your command makes the carvings crackle with electricity. You then hurl the javelin. It shatters immediately after leaving your hand and unleashes its magic as a 4th-level [lightning bolt](../../spells/lightning-bolt.md) originating from your space. The bolt deals `5d12` electricity damage and has a Reflex save DC of 25.
