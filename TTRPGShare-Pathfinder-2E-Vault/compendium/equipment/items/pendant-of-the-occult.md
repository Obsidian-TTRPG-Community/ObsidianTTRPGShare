This amulet is hollow and shaped in the form of an unblinking eye. Its cavity typically holds some fragment of occult text. While wearing the pendant, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) checks, and you can cast the [guidance](../../spells/guidance.md) cantrip as an occult innate spell.
