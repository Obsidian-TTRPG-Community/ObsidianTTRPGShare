Using materials specific to the area, you connect a sound-making component to a trip wire or a pressure plate.

This snare is like an [alarm snare](alarm-snare.md), but its subtle sound blends into ambient noise. You can detect this sound as long as you're within 1,000 feet of the snare and aren't prevented from hearing it. Other creatures in that area who are searching might notice the sound if their [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check result meets or exceeds your Craft DC.
