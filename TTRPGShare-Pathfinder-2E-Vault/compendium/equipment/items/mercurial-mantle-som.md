# Mercurial Mantle *Item 18*  
[apex](../../../rules/traits/apex.md)  [invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Price** 24000 gp
- **Usage** worn cloak; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Apex

This deep red cloak fits lightly about your shoulders, and the edges perpetually twitch slightly, as though caught in a breeze. The cloth feels smoother than silk, rippling and swaying like liquid when in motion. You feel a lively energy infusing your arms and legs. You gain a +3 item bonus to [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) and [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth), and a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks from reactions triggered by your movement.

When you invest the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
