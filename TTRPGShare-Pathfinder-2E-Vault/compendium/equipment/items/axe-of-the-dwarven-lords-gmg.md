The blade of this Dwarven War Axe is carved with an intricate design depicting countless generations of great dwarven warriors and leaders.

The axe has the [thrown <30 feet>](../../../rules/traits/thrown.md) weapon trait, in addition to the normal weapon traits for a dwarven waraxe. [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the axe deal an additional `1d6` damage to orcs. While the axe is in your possession, you gain a +4 item bonus when [Crafting](../../../rules/actions/craft.md) armor, jewelry, metalworking, stonemasonry, snares, traps, and weapons. If you are a dwarf, you gain [greater darkvision](../../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) while holding the axe. If you are not a dwarf, you are [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) while holding the axe, and if you are an orc, you are also [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) and [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) while holding it.

The axe casts a 10th-level [summon elemental](../../../compendium/spells/summon-elemental.md) spell to conjure an elite elemental avalanche. The spell is automatically sustained, requiring no action on your part but still allowing you to command the elemental on each of your turns. You can [Dismiss](../../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the Spell.
