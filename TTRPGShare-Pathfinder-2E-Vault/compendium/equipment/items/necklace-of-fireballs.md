This string of beads appears to be a hemp string with lustrous red beads of various sizes hanging from it. When activated, it briefly appears in its true form: a golden chain with golden spheres attached by fine threads.

Numerous varieties of the necklace of fireballs exist. Each has a different basic Reflex save DC and includes a combination of spheres dealing different amounts of damage, as listed for each type below. When all the beads are gone, the necklace becomes a non-magical hemp string.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You detach a sphere from the necklace, causing it to glow with orange light. After you activate a sphere, if you or anyone else hurls it (an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action with the ranged trait), it detonates as a fireball where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the [fireball](../../../compendium/spells/fireball.md) anywhere within 70 feet, though at the GM's discretion you might need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. If no one hurls the sphere by the start of your next turn, it turns into a non-magical red bead.
