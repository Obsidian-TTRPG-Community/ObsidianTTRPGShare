These sets of rockets come in pairs and strap onto existing footwear (or a creature's feet). Inserting them and aligning them properly takes 1 minute. When you [Activate](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the blast boots, you can [High Jump](../../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../../rules/actions/long-jump.md), without the need to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) first. Higher-level versions increase the distance of your [High Jump](../../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../../rules/actions/long-jump.md).
