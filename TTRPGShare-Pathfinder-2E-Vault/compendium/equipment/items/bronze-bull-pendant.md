This pendant is forged from grainy steel and depicts a snorting bull's face. The pendant must be attached to the chest area or on a shoulder guard. When you activate the pendant, you gain a +2 status bonus to the [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Shove](../../../rules/actions/shove.md), and if you roll a critical failure on the check, you get a failure instead.
