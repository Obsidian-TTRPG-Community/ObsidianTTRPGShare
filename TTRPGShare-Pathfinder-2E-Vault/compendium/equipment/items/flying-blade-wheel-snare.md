When a creature enters the square, a deadly flying wheel of spinning blades launches at it, making a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with an attack modifier of +33 and dealing `8d8` slashing damage. Once on each of your turns, you can use an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action within 120 feet of the wheel to cause it to [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md) up to 60 feet toward the creature it's chasing and make another [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) if it's within 5 feet of its target after it moves. After 1 minute, the spinning ceases and the wheel falls to the ground. Creatures can destroy the wheel to stop it (AC 37, Fort +29, Ref +20, HP 200, Hardness 10, object immunities).
