A polished brass metronome ticks rhythmically within the haft of this +1 striking gnome hooked hammer.

Gnome adherents of [Brigh](../../setting/deities/brigh-logm.md) often attempt to reproduce this item as part of a ritual symbolizing methodical problem-solving and thoughtful craftsmanship.

title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You attempt to [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) a creature with the metronomic hammer

**Effect** By timing the sweeping arcs of your [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) attempt to the built-in metronome of a metronomic hammer, you gain a +1 item bonus to your [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) the target. This item bonus increases by 1 with every subsequent [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) attempt you make with the metronomic hammer against the same target this turn, to a maximum of +3 on your third [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md). The bonus resets to +1 if you successfully [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) the target, if you critically fail to [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) the target, or if your turn ends.
