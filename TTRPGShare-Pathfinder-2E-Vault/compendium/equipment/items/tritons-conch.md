If you put this large opalescent conch shell to your ear, you can hear the sound of the roaring sea crashing against the shore.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You can raise the conch to your lips and blow into it, letting out a long, rumbling note. For the next minute, you and all allies who were within 30 feet of you when you activated the conch gain a +2 item bonus to [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Swim](../../../rules/actions/swim.md) and can breathe under water.
