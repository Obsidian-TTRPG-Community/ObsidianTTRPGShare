# Axiomatic *Item 11*  
[evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [lawful](../../../rules/traits/lawful.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 1400 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a weapon without an anarchic rune
- **Category** Rune

Complex and symmetrical, an axiomatic rune imbues a weapon with lawful energy. A weapon with this rune deals an additional `1d6` lawful damage against chaotic targets. If you are chaotic, you are [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) while carrying or wielding this weapon.

When you critically succeed at an attack roll with this weapon against a chaotic creature, instead of rolling, count each weapon damage die as average damage rounded up (3 for d4, 4 for d6, 5 for d8, 6 for d10, 7 for d12).
