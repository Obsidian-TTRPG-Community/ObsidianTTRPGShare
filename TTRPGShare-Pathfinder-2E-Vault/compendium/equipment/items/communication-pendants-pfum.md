Each of these matching necklaces has been constructed using one half of a purple teardrop-shaped gem, split in two. These pendants function only with the other pendant in their pair and must be crafted together. If one pendant becomes [broken](../../../rules/conditions.md#Broken), the other shatters into non-magical shards. The Price listed above is for a pair of pendants.

title: Activate

You speak, audibly projecting your voice from the pendant you're wearing to the other. Your voice can be heard by whoever is wearing the other pendant no matter how far away the pendants are from each other, as long as the wearer has invested the other pendant and is on the same plane as you. Continued activation allows you to communicate with the other pendant's wearer whenever and for as long as your desire.
