# Ring of Maniacal Devices *Item 11+*  
[divination](../../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)

This ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds. You can use an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to pull a set of [thieves' tools](thieves-tools.md) from the ring. These tools appear in your hand and fold back into the ring if they would leave your possession. They grant you a +2 item bonus to [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) checks to [Disable a Device](../../../rules/actions/disable-a-device.md) and to [Pick a Lock](../../../rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), and the ring's insights grant you the same bonus to [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) checks to [Craft](../../../rules/actions/craft.md) and [Repair](../../../rules/actions/repair.md) snares and traps.

You create a 4th-level [glyph of warding](../../../compendium/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) containing fireball. You can have only one glyph of warding from a ring of maniacal devices active at a time, even if you have multiple rings, and the spell ends if you lose your investiture in the ring.
