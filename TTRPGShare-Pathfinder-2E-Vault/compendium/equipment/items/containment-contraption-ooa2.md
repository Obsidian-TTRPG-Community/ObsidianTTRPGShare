This heavy, mechanized brass suit is studded with pistons, gears, dials, and gauges and topped with a front-facing thick glass porthole. The suit is a suit of +1 full plate. While worn, it completely encloses you, providing protection against inhaled toxins—you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws made against such effects. The suit isn't airtight, however, and doesn't protect against drowning if you're immersed in water or suffocation if you're placed in a vacuum—at least, not until you activate it.

The containment contraption fills with breathable air and filters exterior air or water to create more breathable air for you, as needed. This state persists for up to 1 hour, during which time you can breathe normally in environments where you normally couldn't.

During this time, your circumstance bonus to saving throws against inhaled toxins increases to +2, and you also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against [olfactory](../../../rules/traits/olfactory-b1.md) effects. This effect ends immediately if the containment contraption becomes [broken](../../../rules/conditions.md#Broken).
