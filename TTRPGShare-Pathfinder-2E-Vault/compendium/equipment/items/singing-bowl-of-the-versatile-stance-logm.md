In true Iroran form, the simplicity of this small, inverted copper bell belies its flawlessness.

When struck with a mallet (included with the singing bowl), it emits a harmonious tone that inspires bodily perfection in those who know how to hear it.

While holding the singing bowl of the versatile stance with one hand, you strike the lip of it with a mallet held in the other.

Anyone within 60 feet currently in a stance can spend a reaction to use one of their stance actions in order to change to a different stance.
