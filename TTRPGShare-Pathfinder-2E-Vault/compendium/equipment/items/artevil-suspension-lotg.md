This dried herb is known for its ability to draw toxins from the body, albeit violently. You can administer the suspension orally, [Activating](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the item as part of the same activity you use to [Treat Poison](../../../rules/actions/treat-poison.md). If you succeed at your [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) check to [Treat Poison](../../../rules/actions/treat-poison.md) against an ingested poison, you can reduce the stage of the toxin by one stage, though this can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the poison entirely. If you do, the creature becomes [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) as its body purges the toxin. An artevil suspension doesn't work unless the poison was administered through ingestion; for instance, if a poison can be administered through either ingestion or injury and was administered through injury, the suspension won't work.
