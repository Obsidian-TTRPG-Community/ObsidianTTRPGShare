# Primeval Mistletoe *Item 6+*  
[primal](../../../rules/traits/primal.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Category** Held

This sprig of berry-festooned holly and mistletoe doesn't wilt or rot. It can be used as a primal focus, and it also grants the creature holding it a +1 item bonus to [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) checks.

You squeeze juice from one of the berries and smear it onto a club or staff to cast [shillelagh](../../../compendium/spells/shillelagh.md) upon it.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You can twine the sprig around the wrist of one hand and touch a tree to cast [tree shape](../../../compendium/spells/tree-shape.md) upon yourself, except instead of a becoming a tree, you become a vine on the touched tree.
