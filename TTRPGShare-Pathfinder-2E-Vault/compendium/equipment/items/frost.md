This weapon is empowered with freezing ice. It deals an additional `1d6` cold damage on a successful [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). On a critical hit, the target is also [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save.
