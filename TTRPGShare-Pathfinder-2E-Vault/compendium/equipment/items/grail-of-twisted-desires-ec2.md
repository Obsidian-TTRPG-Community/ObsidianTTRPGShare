This timeworn chalice is constructed of dull tin. It has an unassuming appearance save for the gold, silver, and ebony rings that encircle its rim.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The chalice fills with one of three different wines of your choosing, as described below. The wine looks, tastes, and smells the same regardless of which type you choose, and detect magic has no effect on the liquid beyond indicating that it is magical.

- Ordinary wine.
- Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 2nd-level [restoration](../../../compendium/spells/restoration.md) spell on the drinker.
- Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 4th-level [nightmare](../../../compendium/spells/nightmare.md) spell on the drinker

If you aren't chaotic, the first time each day you activate the chalice, there is a one-in-six chance that the liquid you conjure is a different type (the GM should roll `1d6` as a secret roll) instead. The second and third times you activate the chalice in the same day, the odds of this happening increase to two-in-six or three-insix, respectively. If you are chaotic, the chalice always works as intended.
