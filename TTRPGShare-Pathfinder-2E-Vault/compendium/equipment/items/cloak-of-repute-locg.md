This gaudy and extravagant cloak is adorned with brilliant gems and a fur trim. While wearing the cloak, you gain instant fame and notoriety, granting you a +1 item bonus to [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Make an Impression](../../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md). Creatures attempting to learn about you gain the same bonus to [Gather Information](../../../rules/actions/gather-information.md) about you.
