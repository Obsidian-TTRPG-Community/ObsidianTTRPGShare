This small, heart-shaped amulet appears to be sculpted from stone with a single streak of dim light running through, like an ember just beneath ashes. When worn, the amulet gives off a gentle warmth, akin to being near a fireplace. You gain poison resistance 15 when wearing this amulet.

When you invest the amulet, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

You hold the amulet aloft as a ripple of warm orange light exudes outward. Each ally in a 30-foot emanation regains 30 Hit Points and gains a +3 status bonus to Fortitude saves until the end of their next turn.
