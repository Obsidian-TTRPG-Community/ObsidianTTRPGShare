You touch the collar and your companion splits into a swarm of hundreds of identical Tiny versions of itself for 1 minute. Its space becomes [Large](../../../rules/traits/large-b1.md), it gains the weaknesses and resistances of a spider swarm (Bestiary 306), and the [swarm](../../../rules/traits/swarm-b1.md) trait, though it doesn't gain swarm mind, as it's [controlled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by a single mind. Its unarmed attacks are replaced with a single-action swarming attack that deals `1d8` damage of the type normally inflicted by the companion's unarmed attacks to any foe in its space, with a DC 23 basic Reflex save. While in swarm form, your companion can take the Support action but can't perform its advanced maneuver. Its other statistics don't change. If the companion is reduced to 0 Hit Points while in swarm form, the companion immediately recombines into its original form in an available space, in addition to the usual effects of being reduced to 0 Hit Points.
