This repulsive, hairy glob dangles from the end of your weapon. When you activate the putrescent glob, the creature you damaged must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or its [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition increases to [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), and it can't reduce its [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition until the end of its next turn. On a critical failure, it's also [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.
