# Spell-bastion *Item 13*  
[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 2700 gp
- **Usage** applied to shield
- **Category** Rune

A spell-bastion rune creates a reservoir of eldritch energy within the shield. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 3rd level or lower into the shield. The spell must take 2 actions or fewer to cast and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect—it's instead stored for later. When you invest a spell-bastion shield, you immediately know the name and level of the stored spell. A spell-bastion shield found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM's choice stored in it.

- **Requirements**: Your spell-bastion shield is storing a spell, and you have your shield raised

**Effect** You prepare to unleash the stored spell on any foe that hits you until your next turn.
```

title: Activate [F](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: You use the Shield Block reaction against a foe that the stored spell can target
- **Requirements**: You have a spell stored in your spell-bastion shield, and you've activated the shield since your last turn in preparation for unleashing the spell

**Effect** You unleash the stored spell, which uses the target of the triggering attack as the target of the spell. This empties the spell from the shield and allows a spell to be cast into it again.
```

You harmlessly expend the stored spell. This frees the shield to have a new spell cast into it.
