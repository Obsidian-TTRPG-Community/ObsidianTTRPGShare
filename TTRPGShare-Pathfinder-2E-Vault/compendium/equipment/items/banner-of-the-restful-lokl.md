Carried by knights who expect to spend the night in the open, this simple-looking banner is accompanied by a long cross pole from which it hangs. Usually, the banner appears to be a piece of plain cloth; when activated, it automatically adopts whatever insignia the person activating it desires.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [⏲](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency")

You plant the banner firmly in the ground, and a comfortable environment is created around it in a 20-foot radius. Those within the area are shielded against your choice of hot or cold temperatures, gaining the effects of 1st-level [endure elements](../../../compendium/spells/endure-elements.md). The area created by the banner lasts for 8 hours or until it is removed from the ground.

As part of the activation, you can choose to ward the same area with an [alarm](../../../compendium/spells/alarm.md) spell. In addition to a mental alert for the person who Activates the banner, the alert sent by the [alarm](../../../compendium/spells/alarm.md) spell also includes an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell, which has the [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) trait. You choose the password as you decide to ward the area.
