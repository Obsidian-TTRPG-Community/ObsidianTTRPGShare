# Skarja's Heartstone *Item 13*  
[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 2500 gp
- **Usage** worn
- **Category** Worn

This pale gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws and the ability to discern a target's alignment (as detect alignment, but can detect chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras simultaneously) at will by peering through the gemstone.

Like all hag heartstones, this gemstone is powered by Skarja's spirit. Skarja does not need to wear her heartstone to benefit from its powers, but she cannot use them if she hasn't touched her heartstone in the past 7 days. If Skarja's heartstone is separated from her for more than 7 days (or if she's been dead for 7 days), it becomes a non-magical gemstone. Skarja's heartstone allows her to use additional occult innate spells: [ethereal jaunt](../../spells/ethereal-jaunt.md) (9th level) and [bind soul](../../spells/bind-soul.md) at will, [shadow blast](../../spells/shadow-blast.md) (6th level) twice per day, and [spirit blast](../../spells/spirit-blast.md) once per day.
