[rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor

The mere sight of a suit of noqual armor is enough to make some opposing spellcasters withdraw from the battlefield.

While wearing noqual armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against spell attack rolls. If you [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) while wearing noqual armor, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell fails.
