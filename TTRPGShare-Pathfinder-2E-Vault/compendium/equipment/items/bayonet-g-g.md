# Bayonet *Item 0*  
[agile](../../../rules/traits/agile.md)  [attached <to crossbow or firearm>](../../../rules/traits/attached.md)  [finesse](../../../rules/traits/finesse.md)

- **Category** Martial; **Group** Knife 

This blade or spike can be attached to a crossbow or firearm but, unlike other attached weapons, can be wielded in one hand as its own weapon. When used as a separate weapon, it can't benefit from any runes or abilities that function only for attached weapons.

> [!pf2-note]
> An attached bayonet or reinforced stock requires the same number of hands as the weapon it's attached to. A detached bayonet requires one hand.
