A spider gun is a +1 striking weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm made from the fangs and spinneret of a Large spider. It deals `1d10` poison damage with a range increment of 30 feet and [reload <1>](../../../rules/traits/reload.md). On a critical hit, the venom clings to the target and they take [persistent poison damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to `1d4` + the number of weapon damage dice.

A spider gun does not add critical specialization effects.

The gun can be activated to fire webbing that hampers other creatures.

You fire a mass of webbing at a square within 30 feet. That square becomes covered in webbing for 1 minute. A square covered with the webbing from a spider gun can be cleared by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. The first time each turn a creature in the webbing begins to use a move action or enters the webbing during a move action, it must attempt an [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check or Reflex save against DC 20. On a success, it moves normally through the webbing and clears away the webbing from any squares it enters this turn. On a failure, it treats squares of webbing as difficult terrain this turn, and on a critical failure, it's [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round or until it Escapes (DC 20) or destroys the webbing.
