# Pickpocket's Tailoring *Item 4*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 100 gp
- **Usage** sewn into clothing
- **Category** Clothing

Pickpocket's tailoring modifies an existing outfit by adding concealed interior pockets and strategically opened seams for hiding small objects inside the lining. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Conceal an Object](../../../rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) of light Bulk or less in the pockets. When you get a failure (but not a critical failure, which works as normal) on a [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) check to Conceal such an Object, observers know you're concealing an object somewhere, but they don't find the object unless they succeed at a DC 20 [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check to locate the seams in the garment.
