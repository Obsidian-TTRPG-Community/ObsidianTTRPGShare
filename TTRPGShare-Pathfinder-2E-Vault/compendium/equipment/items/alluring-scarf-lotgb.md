title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")
[emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

You [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md). All creatures within 10 feet of you when you started the [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) must attempt a DC 24 Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [fascinated](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) and must spend at least one of its actions on its next turn to move toward you. A [fascinated](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) creature can attempt another Will save if you move more than 30 feet away from them, and as normal, acting [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) to a creature or its allies breaks fascination automatically. Creatures that critically failed their save don't receive further saves if you move more than 30 feet away, and acting [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) to such a creature's allies allows them to attempt another save, rather than automatically ending the fascination. You can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 minute.
