Made of smooth, white wood, this staff is capped at each end with a golden cross adorned with a multitude of ruby cabochons. A staff of healing grants an item bonus to the Hit Points you restore anytime you cast the [heal](../../spells/heal.md) spell using your own spell slots or using charges from the staff.

```ad-embed-ability

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
