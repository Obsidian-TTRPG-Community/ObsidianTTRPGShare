This fanciful golden ring has an ornate band cast with delicate, swirling decorations and is inlaid with three bright-green emeralds. While wearing this ring, you gain a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed, but only when determining your overland movement per hour.

title: Activate [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

You refresh yourself from fatigue. For 10 minutes, you can ignore the penalties from the [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) condition. This does not remove the condition, it merely suppresses the penalties and drawbacks of having the condition. If something would cause you to become [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) again while the ring's power is in effect, the suppression ends, and you immediately take the penalties again.
