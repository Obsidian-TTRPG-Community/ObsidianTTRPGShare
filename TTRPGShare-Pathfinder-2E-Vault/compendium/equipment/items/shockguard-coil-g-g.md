This miniature Stasian coil talisman emits small sparks when jostled. It uses a combination of Stasian technology and evocation magic to erupt in electricity when discharged.

When you activate the coil, the foe takes `2d12` electricity damage (DC 27 basic Reflex save). On a failed save, the foe is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of its next turn.
