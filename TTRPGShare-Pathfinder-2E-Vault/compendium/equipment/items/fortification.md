# Fortification *Item 12+*  
[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto medium or heavy armor
- **Category** Rune

A fortification rune wards against the most deadly attacks.

Each time you're critically hit while wearing the etched armor, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1 and the Strength required to reduce its penalties by 2.
