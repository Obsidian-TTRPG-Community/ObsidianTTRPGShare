This +3 greater disrupting greater striking silver longsword is made from the purest silver. The blade is carefully etched to depict a vast and sprawling necropolis, a place where the dead are laid to rest. Whenever you critically hit an undead creature with final rest, the undead creature takes `3d6` [persistent good damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), with a DC 36 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** No effect.
> - **Success** The creature takes half the [persistent good damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The creature is [stunned](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and takes the full [persistent good damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [stunned](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and takes double the [persistent good damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

You hold the sword aloft, making it cast [sunburst](../../../compendium/spells/sunburst.md) (DC 38 Reflex save).
