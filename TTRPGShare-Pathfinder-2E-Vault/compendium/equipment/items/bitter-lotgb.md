While you wear this acrid armor, any creature that Engulfs you or Swallows you Whole is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened); if it spends an action retching to reduce the [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition, you can attempt to [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) as a reaction.
