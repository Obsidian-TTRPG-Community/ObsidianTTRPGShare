# Djezet Armor *Item 12+*  
[rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor
- **Category** Armor

Armor made of djezet alloy is easy to enchant. Transferring runes onto djezet armor from other armor waives the usual 1/10 cost to etch the rune. This benefit has no effect on the cost of the rune itself or on the cost to transfer a rune off djezet armor onto a non-djezet armor. High-grade djezet armor can be etched with an additional property rune (to a maximum of four instead of three for +3 armor).
