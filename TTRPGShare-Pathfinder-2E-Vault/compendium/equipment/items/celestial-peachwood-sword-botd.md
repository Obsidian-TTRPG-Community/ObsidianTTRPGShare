From blade to pommel, this sword is carved from a branch of the now-extinct celestial peach tree. The blade of this +3 greater striking disrupting holy peachwood (page 20) shortsword has ancient runes that can permanently destroy the most powerful undead—if you are willing to pay the price. An undead creature of 12th level or lower that takes damage from a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the sword takes `10d6` positive damage (DC 35 basic Fortitude save). This damage is separate from the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) itself and isn't included in [any](../../../rules/traits/any-b1.md) effect based on the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage.

- **Trigger**: You critically hit an undead creature with the celestial peachwood sword

**Effect** The creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be destroyed. If the undead fails its saving throw and is destroyed, you suffer a backlash, taking `1d6` negative damage per level of the destroyed undead.
