- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Weapon

This +2 greater striking shock rapier has a golden blade, and miniature electric arcs flash across its guard while it's wielded. When out of its sheath under an open sky, the blade causes storm clouds to gather slowly above.

- **Trigger**: An [electricity](../../../rules/traits/electricity.md) effect targets you or a creature within 10 feet of you, or has you or a creature within 10 feet of you in its area

**Effect** You try to divert the electricity off course, to be absorbed by storm flash. Choose one eligible creature to protect and roll a melee attack roll against the DC of the [electricity](../../../rules/traits/electricity.md) effect. If you succeed, the chosen creature takes no electricity damage from the triggering effect.
