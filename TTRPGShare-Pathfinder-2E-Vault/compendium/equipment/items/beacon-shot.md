# Beacon Shot *Item 3*  
[consumable](../../../rules/traits/consumable.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Ammunition** [arrow](arrow.md), [bolt](bolt.md)
- **Activate** [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Ammunition

The shaft of a beacon shot is studded with tiny flecks of glimmering gemstones. When an activated beacon shot hits a target, it embeds itself into that target and spews sparks for 1 minute. If the target is [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible), it becomes merely [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to creatures who would otherwise be unable to see it. The sparks also negate the [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition if the target was otherwise [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed).

A creature can remove the arrow or bolt by using an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) basic action and succeeding at a DC 20 [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) check.
