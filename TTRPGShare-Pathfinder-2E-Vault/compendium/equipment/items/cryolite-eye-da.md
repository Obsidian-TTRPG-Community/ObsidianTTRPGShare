- **Category** Contract

You tore your eye from the socket and offered it to whatever spirit would take it. In return, you received a glass eye in its place.

This eye allows you to see as normal, and when you succeed at a [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check against an illusion, you get a critical success instead. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your bargained contract can overwhelm your cryolite eye with magical energy, causing images to float over your vision that inflict the [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) condition on you for 1 minute.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You look through the glass eye sealing your bargained contract. The contract casts see invisibility affecting you.
