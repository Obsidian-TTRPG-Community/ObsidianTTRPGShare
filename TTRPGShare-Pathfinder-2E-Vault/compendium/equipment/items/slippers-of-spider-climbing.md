These soft slippers are made of fine gray silk. If the slippers are left unattended for a while, they tend to attract spiders that nest inside.

Tiny, hairlike tendrils extend from the slippers' soles, allowing you to walk on vertical surfaces or even to move upside down along ceilings. For 1 minute, you gain a 20-foot climb Speed and you don't need to use your hands to [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md). However, the slippers require decent traction for you to walk on a wall, so they provide no benefit when you're moving across greased, icy, or oiled surfaces.
