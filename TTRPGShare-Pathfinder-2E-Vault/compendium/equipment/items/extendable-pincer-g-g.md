This extendable rod features a pincer on one end and clamped handle on the other. By squeezing the handle, the pincer opens or closes. As an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action, you can extend or retract the rod by 5 feet to one of three settings, allowing you to [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to pick up an object with the pincer either within your own space, in an adjacent space, or exactly 10 feet away.
