This snare snags a creature with its wicked metal hooks. The first creature to enter the square takes `5d8` piercing damage and `5d8` slashing damage, with a DC 27 basic Reflex save. On a critical failure, the hooks piercing its flesh make the creature [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it successfully Escapes (DC 27)

Magic Consumables Though they might last a fleeting moment, these magic items can decide the outcome of an entire battle or quest. You can find these magic consumables organized by level and subcategory on the treasure tables on pages 250–251. The Core Rulebook contains full rules for special categories of items, such as talismans, and the page numbers where they appear can be found in the glossary and index, starting on page 266 of this book.
