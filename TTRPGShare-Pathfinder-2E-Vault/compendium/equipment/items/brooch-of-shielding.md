This piece of silver or gold jewelry is adorned with miniature images of kite shields and can be used to fasten a cloak or cape. The brooch automatically absorbs [magic missile](../../spells/magic-missile.md) spells targeting you. A brooch of shielding can absorb 30 individual [magic missile](../../spells/magic-missile.md)s before it melts and becomes useless.

Sometimes when found, a brooch of shielding has already absorbed a number of missiles.
