# Sage's Lash *Item 18*  
[apex](../../../rules/traits/apex.md)  [invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Price** 24000 gp
- **Usage** worn belt
- **Category** Apex

The thin, glittering strands of rope that comprise this thick belt appear to be spun gold. Strung along the front of the belt are a collection of four multicolored, perfectly spherical beads: jade, turquoise, quartz, and amethyst.

While wearing the lash, you gain a +3 item bonus to [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion).

When you invest the belt, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

You touch one of the jewels affixed to the sage's lash and speak a command word. Depending on the jewel, a different effect is produced that affects you and all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation. After the effect occurs, all four jewels disappear from the lash, reappearing at the next dawn.

- **Jade** (healing, positive) Speak "purity" to produce a wave of green light that ends any [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition and any ongoing poison damage affecting creatures in the emanation.
- **Turquoise** Speak "clarity" to grant all affected a +2 status bonus to their next Will save for 1 minute.
- **Quartz** (healing, positive) Speak "lenity" to have each creature regain 30 Hit Points.
- **Amethyst** (divination, light, revelation) Speak "verity" to emit a magical trail of light from the lash that reveals the location of each creature in the emanation. For 1 round, if they would be [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible), they become [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) instead, and if they would be [undetected](../../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) or [unnoticed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) by a creature, they're [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) instead. A creature can attempt a DC 43 [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check to avoid the lash's detection.
