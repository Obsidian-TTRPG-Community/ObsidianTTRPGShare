- **Requirements**: You're receiving a bonus to AC from your dragon's breath cape or shield

**Effect** If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with an area of effect that deals the same type of damage as the depicted dragon's breath weapon, the spell gains the effects of the Widen Spell feat (Core Rulebook 210). The rune can only affect spells of a specific level or lower, determined by the type of rune.
