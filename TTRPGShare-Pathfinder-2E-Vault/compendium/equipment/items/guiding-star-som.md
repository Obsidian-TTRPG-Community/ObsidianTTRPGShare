**Effect** Soft light outlines the target. At the beginning of your next turn, the guiding star's blades detach and form into darts of starlight, flying up to 40 feet and striking the target unerringly, collectively dealing 4 piercing damage and 1 good damage before re-forming. The piercing damage increases to 6 with a greater striking rune and 8 with a major striking rune.
