These sturdy, average manacles are connected by a thick iron chain that is much heavier than its appearance suggests at a glance.

Followers of Zon-Kuthon sometimes employ manacles of persuasion against captured enemies and spies. When the manacles are locked around an [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) creature's wrists, they begin to sap the life out of the victim, dealing 2 negative damage per hour until the creature falls [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). The effect is nonlethal, so the damage doesn't cause the creature to become [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying).

While the creature is [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), the manacles deal no damage and allow the creature to recover Hit Points normally to a maximum of 10 Hit Points, at which point the manacles begin to deal damage once more. The manacles have no effect on a creature that is not [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized).
