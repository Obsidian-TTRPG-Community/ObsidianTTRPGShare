This +1 striking disrupting spiked chain comes in a rich, green color with rose petals painted on the handle in varying shades of red and pink. The chain seems to banish nearby shadows.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You hold the chain out before you, and the weapon glows as bright as a torch. You can suppress this light by [Activating](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the weapon again.
```

- **Trigger**: You critically succeed at a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a fiend or undead

**Effect** The weapon unleashes its light in an attempt to destroy the target. The vine of roses casts a 3rd-level [searing light](../../../compendium/spells/searing-light.md) spell with the triggering creature as the target. In place of a spell attack roll, make a weapon attack roll with the vine of roses using the same multiple attack penalty as the triggering [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).
