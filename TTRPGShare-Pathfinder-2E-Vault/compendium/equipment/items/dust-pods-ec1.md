You hide fragile pods of pollen or other clinging powder that get in the eyes of the first creature that enters the snare's square. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Reflex saving throw. A creature [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) by the pollen can use an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to attempt a DC 5 flat check to remove the condition.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature is [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 10 minutes.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [blinded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 10 minutes after.
