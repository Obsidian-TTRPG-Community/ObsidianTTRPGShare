Drinking this dull-black liquid makes you undetectable to divinations. This grants the same effects as mind blank, but without the bonus against [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects. You also gain the effects of a 4th-level [invisibility](../../spells/invisibility.md) spell, which protects against [see invisibility](../../spells/see-invisibility.md) spells of 8th level and lower and has a DC of 36 against true seeing. The potion's effects last for 10 minutes.
