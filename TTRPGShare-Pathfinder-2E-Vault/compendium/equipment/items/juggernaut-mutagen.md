After you drink this mutagen, your body becomes thick and sturdy. You exhibit a healthy glow, though you tend to be ponderous and unobservant.

**Benefit** You gain an item bonus to Fortitude saves and the listed number of temporary Hit Points. Whenever you are at maximum Hit Points for at least 1 full minute, you regain the temporary Hit Points.

**Drawback** You take a –2 penalty to Will saves, [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks, and initiative rolls.
