These small brooches usually feature carved reliefs of verminous, swarming creatures. When you wear the clasp, you gain resistance 10 to physical damage from swarm creatures.

title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You thrust your hand into the swarm, draw forth a squirming mass of vermin, and devour it. You recover `3d10+8` Hit Points and deal the same amount of bludgeoning damage to the swarm. The Hit Point recovery is a positive [healing](../../../rules/traits/healing.md) effect.
