This +2 greater striking dancing shortsword has a golden handguard resembling a bird with outstretched wings. The sword's blade is [broken](../../../rules/conditions.md#Broken) halfway up its length, but this doesn't impair the sword's function.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You attempt to [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) or [Disarm](../../../rules/actions/disarm.md) an opponent using [Thievery](../../../compendium/skills.md#Thievery) instead of [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics), and you add the blade of the Rabbit Prince's item bonus to the check. You do not need to have a hand free if you're wielding the blade of the Rabbit Prince, and your target can be up to two sizes larger than you.
