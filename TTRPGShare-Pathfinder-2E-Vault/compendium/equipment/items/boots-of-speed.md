These sleek red boots make your legs feel like they're bursting with energy. You gain a +5-foot item bonus to your land Speed and to any climb or swim Speeds you have.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You click the heels of the boots together and gain the [quickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition for 1 minute. You can use the extra action to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md), [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md), or [Swim](../../../rules/actions/swim.md). (You must still attempt an [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check for the [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md) and [Swim](../../../rules/actions/swim.md) actions unless you have the appropriate movement type.)
