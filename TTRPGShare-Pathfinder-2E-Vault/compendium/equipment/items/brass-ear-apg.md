A brass ear is a short, flared tube with one end narrow enough to comfortably fit against the ear canal. When using a brass ear to listen through a door, window, thin wall, or similar barrier, if the barrier would normally increase the DC of your [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check to hear sounds on the other side, the DC increases by only half as much as normal.
