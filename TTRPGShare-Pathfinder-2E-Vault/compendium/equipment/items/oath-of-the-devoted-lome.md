You gain fire and mental resistance 5.

When you die, you rise as an undead creature with the [zombie](../../../rules/traits/zombie-b1.md) trait on the next round; if you are a PC, you become an NPC under Walkena's control. Your stats remain the same, except that your alignment changes to evil. If you reach 0 Hit Points as a zombie, you are destroyed and do not rise again.

You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves. Choose a weapon or an unarmed [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md); your chosen attack deals an extra `1d6` fire damage for the next 1 minute.
