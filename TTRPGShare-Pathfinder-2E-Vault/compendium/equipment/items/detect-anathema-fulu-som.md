Given to undisciplined acolytes at risk of breaking their vows, this fulu activates on its own if its wearer begins to perform an act anathema to a specific deity or cause, decided at the time of crafting. The fulu heats up when activated, giving you enough warning to correct your actions; if you proceed, the fulu immolates in a burst of flame. This deals `4d6` fire damage and brands your skin until you receive an appropriate atone ritual. Either way, activating the fulu consumes it.
