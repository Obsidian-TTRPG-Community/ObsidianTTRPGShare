Silver armor sickens certain creatures that touch it. A creature with weakness to silver that critically fails an unarmed attack against a creature in silver armor becomes [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened). A creature with weakness to silver is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) as long as it wears silver armor.
