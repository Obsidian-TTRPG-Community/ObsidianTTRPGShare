A mortar fires its shells at a high angle, allowing it to bypass obstacles and strike from above. A crew typically sets up such a weapon behind a wall or in another hard-to-access area to protect themselves while retaining full functionality.

Due to the steep angle of its arc, such mortars are especially useful when opposing barricaded targets.

`5d10` slashing, 20-foot burst, DC 21. Because a mortar launches its round at a high angle, the mortar round descends on the center of the burst from above, not in a straight line from the mortar. This affects whether creatures have cover from the mortar launch.
