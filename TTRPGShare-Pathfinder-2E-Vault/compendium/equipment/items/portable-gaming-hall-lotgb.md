A portable gaming hall resembles a miniature roulette wheel, except it's marked with indecipherable runes, not numbers.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [⏲](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency")

The wheel grows into a circular room 30 feet in diameter, with a door on one side. Six chairs surround a circular table, 10 feet in diameter. The underside of the table contains retractable drawers full of dice, harrow cards, game pieces, and other gambling accouterments. A gallon of ale or a similar drink with a spigot near the bottom hangs on the door, replenishing to a full gallon each day; you can also bring in your own drinks if you require more than the gaming hall provides.

You can flip the central table over as a 3-action activity, which has the [manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to revert the gaming hall to its original form.
