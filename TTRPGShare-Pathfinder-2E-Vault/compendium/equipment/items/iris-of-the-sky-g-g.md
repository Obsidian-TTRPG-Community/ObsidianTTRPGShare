This +1 striking jezail is built from white hot metal and has a ruby fused into the palm wood stock. When the iris of the sky misfires, you take 5 [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

The first firearm of this type came as the result of a gunslinger who entreated an efreeti, wishing for the might of the desert sun. The weapon constantly glows and burns with a brilliant intensity. The firearm has since belonged to an extensive string of users and been replicated several times, though each wielder of the weapon, whether the original or one of its copies, has eventually ended up as a charred husk, slain by fire in battle or unusual accidents that no one could quite explain except, perhaps, the efreet.

You focus the solar energy housed in the ruby to release a gout of solar flame instead of a bullet. Make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the iris of the sky. All damage from this [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) is fire damage and the target takes an additional `1d6` fire damage and `1d6` [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You make a wish into the iris of the sky, yearning for it to strike true, and then fire. [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe with the iris, rolling the attack roll twice and taking the better result. If the attack is a failure, you take 5 [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
