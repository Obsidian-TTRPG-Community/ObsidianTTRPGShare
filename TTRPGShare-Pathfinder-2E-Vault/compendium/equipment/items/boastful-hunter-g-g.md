Possessing a boisterous, proud demeanor, this jezail is an aspiring big game hunter, always quick to share a tale of its bold adventures and predatory conquests—although the veracity of such tales is often questionable. A boastful hunter enjoys tracking and hunting animals of all kinds but takes particular pleasure in taking down large, dangerous, or rare animals. Against an animal, the boastful hunter deals `1d6` additional damage. On a critical hit against an animal, the boastful hunter also deals `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

A boastful hunter urges you to face off against tougher and tougher creatures—a challenge the ambitious rifle may not be adequate to deal with. If the boastful hunter goes one week without participating in a hunt against an animal of at least your level, it becomes bored. A bored boastful hunter complains incessantly and imposes a –1 item penalty to attack rolls against non-animal targets. A bored boastful hunter can be appeased by using it in combat against an animal of at least your level.

Unable to accept its own weaknesses, a boastful hunter blames any failed hunts on you, and considers remarks about its strength or quality a terrible insult. An insulted boastful hunter badmouths you to sentient creatures you interact with, imposing a –1 item penalty to [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy), and [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation) skill checks, and all attacks with it incur a misfire chance until the weapon is appeased. An insulted boastful hunter can be appeased by complimenting it and succeeding at a [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) check against its Will DC two days in a row. You can only attempt a [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) check to appease the boastful hunter once each day.
