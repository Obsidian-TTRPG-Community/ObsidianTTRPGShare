# Crowbar *Item 0*  

- **Price** 5 sp
- **Bulk** L
- **Hands** 2

When [Forcing Open](../../../rules/actions/force-open.md) an object that doesn't have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Force Open](../../../rules/actions/force-open.md).
