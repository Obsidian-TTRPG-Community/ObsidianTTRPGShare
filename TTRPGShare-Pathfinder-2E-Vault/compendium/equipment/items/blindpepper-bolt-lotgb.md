# Blindpepper Bolt *Item 3*  
[consumable](../../../rules/traits/consumable.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Ammunition** [bolt](bolt.md)
- **Activate** [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Consumable

The head of this bolt is a vented container that smells strongly of caustic pepper. When an activated blindpepper bolt hits a target, it deals no damage; instead the creature must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. If the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical success, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude save. At the GM's discretion, a creature with no eyes or olfactory organs might not be affected by this item.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of your next turn. It can end the effect early if it spends an action, which has the [manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to wipe down its eyes.
> - **Failure** The target is [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [blinded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of your next turn and [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
