- **Requirements**: You're under the effect of a [polymorph](../../../rules/traits/polymorph.md) spell you prepared from this grimoire that offers a choice of multiple forms

**Effect** You transform into a different form allowed by the [polymorph](../../../rules/traits/polymorph.md) by bending and molding the spell's energy. This reduces the spell's remaining duration by half.
