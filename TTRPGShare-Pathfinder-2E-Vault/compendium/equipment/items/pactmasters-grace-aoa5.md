Granted by Katapesh's Pactmasters to influential merchants, exceptional Zephyr Guards, and favorite retainers, these blue crystal–studded platinum rings sharpen their wearers' urban instincts. You gain a +3 item bonus to [Mercantile Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) checks while wearing the ring, and you can attempt checks that require a proficiency rank of master in [Society](../../skills.md#Society). While invested, the ring grants a +2 item bonus to saving throws while you are in an urban setting, and this increases to a +3 item bonus if you have legendary proficiency in [Guild Lore](../../skills.md#Lore), [Katapesh Lore](../../skills.md#Lore), [Mercantile Lore](../../skills.md#Lore), or [Society](../../skills.md#Society).
