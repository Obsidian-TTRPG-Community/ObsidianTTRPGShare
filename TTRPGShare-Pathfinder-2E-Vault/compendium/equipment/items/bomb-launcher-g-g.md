# Bomb Launcher *Item 1*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

This long, hollow tube is held in two hands and braced over the shoulder. Inside, it contains a small metal basket sized to hold alchemical bombs. A chute in the top delivers an alchemical bomb into the internal basket, while a lever on the underside pulls the basket back and locks it in place. Loading an alchemical bomb into a bomb launcher requires a single [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action. With a pull of a trigger, the basket speeds forward, allowing you to [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the loaded alchemical bomb over long distances. Bombs fired with a bomb launcher have a range increment of 60 feet.
