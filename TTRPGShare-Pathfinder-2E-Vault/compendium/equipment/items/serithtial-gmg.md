The legendary blade Serithtial is said to have been forged by [Iomedae](../../setting/deities/iomedae.md), goddess of honor, justice, and valor. She is an [intelligent](../../../rules/traits/intelligent-gmg.md) bastard sword. Although the sword is made of steel, Serithtial is also treated as cold iron and silver, allowing her to deal more damage to certain supernatural creatures. She glows as bright as a torch, but you or Serithtial can suppress or resume this glow as a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. In addition, [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with Serithtial deal an additional `2d6` damage against creatures that are worshippers of [Zon-Kuthon](../../setting/deities/zon-kuthon.md), and while wielding Serithtial, you constantly benefit from [death ward](../../spells/death-ward.md) and [freedom of movement](../../spells/freedom-of-movement.md) spells that function only against effects created by followers of [Zon-Kuthon](../../setting/deities/zon-kuthon.md).

Serithtial was forged as a [bastard sword](bastard-sword.md), and she reverts to this shape when no one wields her, but she can also detect what sort of blade her current wielder prefers and transform into it (choosing from [dagger](dagger.md), [shortsword](shortsword.md), [longsword](longsword.md), [scimitar](scimitar.md), [falchion](falchion.md), [greatsword](greatsword.md), [rapier](rapier.md), or [bastard sword](bastard-sword.md)) using an action, which she does when first held. The wielder can empathically tell Serithtial to transform at any time by using a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, after which Serithtial uses an action to transform.

Serithtial is willing to work with a partner of almost any alignment as long as they are dedicated to defeating the great wyrm Kazavon and the forces of [Zon-Kuthon](../../setting/deities/zon-kuthon.md). If you ignore those threats and pursue your own agenda instead, before long Serithtial attempts to seize control of your body (DC 45 Will save to resist her control), though she typically remains in control for only long enough to find a more worthy partner. You can attempt a new Will save each day to retake control of your body.

title: Activate

Serithtial spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th level [heal](../../../compendium/spells/heal.md) or [zone of truth](../../../compendium/spells/zone-of-truth.md) spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).
