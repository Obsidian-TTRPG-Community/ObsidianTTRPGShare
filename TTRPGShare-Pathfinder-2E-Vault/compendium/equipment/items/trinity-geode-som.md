The crystal chamber within this split geode is divided into three lobes of equal size. The spell DC of any spell cast by [Activating](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) this item is 17.

- **Armor** After you cast an earth spell by [Activating](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the geode, you gain resistance 1 to physical damage (except adamantine) until the end of your next turn, or double the resistance for a non-cantrip spell.
- **Weapon** After you cast an earth spell by [Activating](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the geode, your [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the weapon deal an additional `1d4` bludgeoning damage until the end of your next turn.
