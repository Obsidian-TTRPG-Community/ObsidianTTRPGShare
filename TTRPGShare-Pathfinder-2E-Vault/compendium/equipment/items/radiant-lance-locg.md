When wielded in battle, these silver lances blaze with light.

A radiant lance is a +2 greater striking holy flaming silver lance.

When wielded in battle, the radiant lance sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius. On a hit against an undead creature that is specifically vulnerable to sunlight, the lance bursts with a brilliant flash of light, and that undead must attempt a DC 35 Fortitude save. If the attack was a critical hit, the undead uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.

Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md); Frequency once per day; Effect You point the lance at a foe and call out, firing a beam with the effects of a 7th-level [searing light](../../spells/searing-light.md).
