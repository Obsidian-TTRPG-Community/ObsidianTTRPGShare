This foul-smelling unguent dulls the odors and traces that fungus creatures detect. For 1 day after you slather this musk on your body, fungus creatures take a –4 penalty to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) you or otherwise notice you. If a fungus creature is mindless, it instead has a –6 penalty.

The musk also grants you a +1 item bonus to AC against melee attacks from fungus creatures with no vision for the same period of time. The effects of fungal walk musk end immediately if you're submerged in water or subject to another olfactory effect.
