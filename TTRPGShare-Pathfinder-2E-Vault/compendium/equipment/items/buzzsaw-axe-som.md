# Buzzsaw Axe *Item 11+*  
[evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

With an aerodynamic cutting edge and a curved handle, this +2 striking battle axe is perfectly suited to whirling motions, and in fact seems like it wants to whirl free from your grip. A [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with this axe that benefits from the [sweep](../../../rules/traits/sweep.md) trait's circumstance bonus on attack rolls also gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll.

title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You hurl the axe, which spins at great speed as it flies to a distant point and returns to you, leaving a trail of carnage. Each creature in a 120-foot line must succeed at a DC 28 basic Reflex save or take damage equal to the weapon's melee damage, including your Strength modifier.
