title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

Attempt a DC 20 check to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about people of a human ethnicity, a non-human ancestry, or some other type of creature. (The GM determines what your options are.) If you succeed, the badge's bonus increases to +2 for [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks with creatures of that group for the rest of the day.
