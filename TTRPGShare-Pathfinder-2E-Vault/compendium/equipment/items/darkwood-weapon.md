[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon

Darkwood weapons are as dark as ebony, with a slight purple tint. A darkwood weapon's Bulk is reduced by 1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on a weapon that normally has light Bulk).
