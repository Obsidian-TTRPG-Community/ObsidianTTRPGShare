- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Artifact

This shining prism is bound within a golden frame. The bright glow within the artifact is the gleaming essence of celestials bound within it in ancient times. Each activation consumes a bit of this celestial energy, projecting the screams of the celestials into your mind. While holding the Radiant Spark, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against divine spells and effects and you are aware of its powers. If you are good, while holding the Radiant Spark, you are [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and can't recover from this condition.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

The Radiant Spark casts a 10th-level [dominate](../../../compendium/spells/dominate.md) spell (DC 49) on a creature that isn't from the Material Plane. Celestials get an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their save.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [F](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: You begin casting a planar binding ritual

**Effect** The Radiant Spark reduces the casting time of the ritual to 1 hour, and you don't need secondary casters for this ritual.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: The target critically fails their save against the Radiant Spark's [dominate](../../../compendium/spells/dominate.md) spell or you critically succeed at binding the target with the planar binding ritual using the artifact

**Effect** The target must attempt a DC 49 Will save and is immune to further attempts for 24 hours.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained).
> - **Failure** The target dies and its essence is trapped within the Radiant Spark. It can be brought back to life only with powerful magic such as wish or miracle.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target can't be brought back to life until the Radiant Spark is destroyed. Destruction An archfiend or evil demigod must willingly swap their essence with that of a celestial dominated or bound by the artifact, then critically fail the saving throw against having their essence consumed. This permanently destroys both the artifact and the fiend or demigod.
