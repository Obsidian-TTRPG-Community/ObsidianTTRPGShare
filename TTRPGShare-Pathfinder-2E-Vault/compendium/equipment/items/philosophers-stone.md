An alchemist with the [Craft Philosopher's Stone](../../feats/craft-philosophers-stone.md) feat can create a philosopher's stone once per month by spending 1 batch of infused reagents during their daily preparations using the advanced alchemy class feature. This is the only way to create a philosopher's stone.

At a glance, a philosopher's stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a [Force Open](../../../rules/actions/force-open.md) action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone's heart. The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can transmute base metals into precious metals or create an [elixir of rejuvenation](elixir-of-rejuvenation.md).

To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) and have the [Alchemical Crafting](../../feats/alchemical-crafting.md) feat. You can then use the stone's quicksilver for one of two effects:

- You can apply the stone's quicksilver to an [infused](../../../rules/traits/infused.md) true elixir of life using an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action. This turns the elixir into an [infused](../../../rules/traits/infused.md) [elixir of rejuvenation](elixir-of-rejuvenation.md) instantaneously. This doesn't require any crafting time or additional materials.
- You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold. Treat this as a 20th-level task to [Earn Income](../../../rules/actions/earn-income.md) using [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting), except that you create 500 gp worth of your chosen metal per day on a success or 750 gp worth per day on a critical success.
