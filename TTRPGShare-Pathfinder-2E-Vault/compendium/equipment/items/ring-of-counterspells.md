This ornate silver ring bears two competing geometric designs of brightly colored and wildly clashing inlaid gemstones. A spellcaster can cast a single spell into this ring as long as no spell is currently stored within, expending the normal time, costs, and so forth to [Cast the Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md). The spell's effect doesn't occur; the spell's power is instead stored within the ring.

When you invest a ring of counterspells, you immediately know the name and level of the spell stored inside, if any. A ring of counterspells found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell stored in it. The GM determines that spell.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You are targeted by or within the area of the spell stored within the ring

**Effect** You can attempt to counteract the triggering spell, using the level of the spell stored in the ring and a counteract modifier of +19.

Once you do, the stored spell's energy is spent, and the ring is empty.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You harmlessly expend the stored spell, having no effect but emptying the ring so that another spell can be cast into it.
```
