This +1 disrupting striking whip has a single strip of anointed leather wrapped around its hilt in a spiral pattern. The handle of the whip ends in an oak spike that has been sanctified with ashes from [Pharasma](../../setting/deities/pharasma.md)'s Boneyard. If the spike is used to stake a vampire that's vulnerable to being staked, the vampire is immediately destroyed, without having to sever its head and anoint it with holy water. If the whip is buried with a creature, that creature can't rise as an undead as long as the whip remains by its side.
