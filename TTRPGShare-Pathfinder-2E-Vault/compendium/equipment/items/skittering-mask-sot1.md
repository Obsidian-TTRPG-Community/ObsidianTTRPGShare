This carved wooden full-head mask sports several holes along each side of the face. The first time each day that you begin your turn [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and within 25 feet of an enemy, metallic insect legs emerge from the holes in the mask and [Step](../../../rules/actions/step.md) 5 feet away from the nearest enemy, dragging your body along with the mask. If more than one enemy is equidistant, the mask [Steps](../../../rules/actions/step.md) away from one of them at random. The mask possesses no special senses and does not react to [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](../../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) enemies, nor can it distinguish that a creature not acting openly [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) is an enemy.
