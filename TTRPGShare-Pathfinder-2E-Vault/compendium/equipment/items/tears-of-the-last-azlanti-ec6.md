- **Usage** worn necklace; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Artifact

This gold necklace sports six bails, each with a different aeon stone. The backside of each bail is engraved with a single ancient Azlanti rune: Patience, Remembrance, Resilience, Tenacity, Wisdom, Invention.

While a bail is active, you recall pieces of childhood memories, brief stories and lessons spoken to you by Aroden. The knowledge imparted by each bail carries a specific power but also allows you to access the invested and resonant powers of the aeon stone in the active bail's slot as though the stone orbited your head. Each day at dawn, a new bail becomes active; roll `1d6` to determine which bail is active, determined by the table below. Only one bail can be active at any time.

Once per day, you can attempt to exchange the aeon stone in a given bail for another aeon stone with a successful DC 35 [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) check.
