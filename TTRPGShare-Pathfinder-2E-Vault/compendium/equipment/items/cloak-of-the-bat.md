[invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** worn cloak; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

Sewn from several long strips of luxurious brown and black silk, this cloak grants you a +2 item bonus to [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) checks as well as to [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Maneuver in Flight](../../../rules/actions/maneuver-in-flight.md). You can also use your feet to hang from any surface that can support your weight, without requiring any check, though you still must attempt [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md) in order to move around while inverted.

title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You can either transform the cloak into bat-like wings that grant you a fly Speed of 30 feet for 10 minutes, or have the cloak turn you into a bat by casting a 4th-level [pest form](../../../compendium/spells/pest-form.md) spell on you.
