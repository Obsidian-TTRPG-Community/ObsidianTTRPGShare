A gecko potion is a sticky, tawny brown liquid with flecks of sand suspended in it. For 5 minutes after drinking this potion, your fingertips sprout thousands of microscopic, bristled hairs that cling to objects, granting you a +1 item bonus to [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md) and [Palm an Object](../../../rules/actions/palm-an-object.md), and to your Reflex DC against [Disarm](../../../rules/actions/disarm.md) attempts.
