This fist-sized, 12-rayed black star sapphire is sacred to Yueral, the elven goddess of magic and jewels, and most accounts of its creation attribute its crafting to a circle of her worshippers. In addition to the abilities listed below, the gem functions as a portal key for Jewelgate at [Alseta](../../setting/deities/alseta-logm.md)'s Ring.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You touch the Eye of the Wise to a gem worth at least 10 gp, whereupon the Eye of the Wise assumes the appearance of the touched gemstone. While this connection is active, the carriers of the Eye of the Wise and of the other gemstone can communicate telepathically with one another over any distance, as long as both are on the same plane.

This connection is [broken](../../../rules/conditions.md#Broken) if the other gemstone is damaged, if the Eye of the Wise becomes attuned to another gemstone, or if the bearer of the Eye of the Wise Dismisses the activation.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You hold the Eye of the Wise up to your own eye and peer through it. The Eye of the Wise grows transparent and grants you a +2 item bonus to attempts to [Decipher Writing](../../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md), [Disable a Device](../../../rules/actions/disable-a-device.md), [Identify Magic](../../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md), [Pick a Lock](../../../rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md), or [Sense Motive](../../../rules/actions/sense-motive.md). You can Sustain this activation as long as you hold the gem in place.
