- **Category** Talisman

Dark smoke seems to writhe within this obsidian gem. When you activate the gem, you make an [Intimidating Strike](../../feats/intimidating-strike.md), as the fighter feat.

If you have the [Intimidating Strike](../../feats/intimidating-strike.md) feat, increase the [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition value from this Intimidating [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) to [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit.
