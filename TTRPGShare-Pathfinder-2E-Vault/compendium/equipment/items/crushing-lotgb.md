Weapons with this rune empower your strength, and attacks with these weapons leave your foe staggered. When you critically hit a target with this weapon, your target becomes [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the end of your next turn.
