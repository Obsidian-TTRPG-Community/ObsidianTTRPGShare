# Scope Of Truth *Item 13*  
[divination](../../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 3000 gp
- **Usage** attached <to firearm or crossbow (scope)>; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Scope

The scope of truth is a bit bigger than most to accommodate larger lenses, which have been magically prepared with tiny shards from crystal balls to reveal the truth. The scope grants you a +2 item bonus to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks made to [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) in areas you can see through the scope.

For the next 10 minutes, you can see things through the scope as they actually are. The GM rolls a secret counteract check with a +20 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 7 against any illusion or transmutation in the area, but only for the purpose of determining whether you see through it, not to end the spell or effect. For instance, if the check succeeds against a polymorph spell, you can see the creature's true form, but you don't end the spell.
