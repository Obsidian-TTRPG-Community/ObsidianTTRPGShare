# Powder *Item 0*

A bag of powder contains powdered chalk, flour, or similar materials. In addition to other uses for powder, it can be handy while adventuring to help pinpoint [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures.

You can throw the powder into an adjacent square as an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action. If there's a creature in that square, it becomes temporarily [observed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Observed) until the end of your turn, though the creature still has concealment due to invisibility. The powder quickly falls away or becomes [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) itself, preventing you from tracking the creature indefinitely.
