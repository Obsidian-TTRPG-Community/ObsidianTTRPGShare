# Hwacha *Item 4*  
[large](../../../rules/traits/large-b1.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 180 gp
- **Usage** mounted (black powder)
- **Category** Siege Weapon

Rather than a shoot a single, large projectile like a boulder, the hwacha fires dozens of rocket-propelled arrows at once. The frame of the hwacha holds 100 tubes, each loaded with an arrow or a small bundle of arrows wrapped with a small amount Fiend's Mouth Cannon Hwacha of black powder and attached to a fuse. By lighting a master fuse, you can make all of the arrows fire in rapid succession.

[manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

Each Load action loads 10 hwacha arrows. Taking the Launch action requires three Load actions to load 30 hwacha arrows, but you can continue to Load more arrows to increase the effect of the next Launch action, as detailed below.

`4d8` piercing, 20-foot burst, DC 18 Reflex. If you loaded at least 70 hwacha arrows, the area increases to a 25-foot burst. If you loaded 100 hwacha arrows, the area increases to a 30-foot burst and the damage to `5d8` piercing.
