# Abysium Armor *Item 12+*  
[rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor
- **Category** Armor

Typically only creatures immune to abysium's effects would don abysium armor. You're [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) while wearing standard-grade armor made from abysium, or [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) while wearing high-grade armor made from abysium. You can't reduce your [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition while wearing abysium armor, or for 1 hour after removing it. Abysium armor is dangerous to nearby creatures, too. Creatures within 10 feet of abysium armor must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 30 for standard grade or DC 40 for high grade) or become [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) ([sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical failure). Afterwards, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute, but if they remain within the area for longer than 1 minute, they automatically critically fail the next save.
