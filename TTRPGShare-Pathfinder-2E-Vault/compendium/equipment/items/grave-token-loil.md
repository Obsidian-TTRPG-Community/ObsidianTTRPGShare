This simple charm is made from compacted grave dirt infused with bone dust. A [harm](../../spells/harm.md) spell that's empowered by this catalyst can reach faraway targets. If the [harm](../../spells/harm.md) spell is cast with 1 action, its range is 30 feet; if it's cast with 2 actions, its range is 60 feet. This has no effect on the three-action area version of harm, though in most cases, you don't have enough actions to Activate the token and cast a three-action harm anyway.
