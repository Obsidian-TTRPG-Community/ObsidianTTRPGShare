title: Activate

You cast [grease](../../../compendium/spells/grease.md), but the grease is caustic. If you cast this spell on an area, any creature that fails their Reflex save and falls [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), or that begins their turn [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), takes `1d6` acid damage. If you cast this spell on an unattended object, the first creature to pick up the object during the duration takes `1d6` [persistent acid damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). If you cast this spell on an attended object and the holder or wielder fails their [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) or Reflex save, the holder or wielder takes `1d6` [persistent acid damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). If you cast this spell on a worn object, any creature who Grapples or Grabs the wearer takes `1d6` acid damage.
