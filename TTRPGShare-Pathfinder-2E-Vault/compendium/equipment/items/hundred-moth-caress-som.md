The handles of this +1 striking scythe are made from a dull, gray wood of bone-like consistency, and when you slice with it, a fluttering gust of hundreds of moths' wingbeats fills the air. If you're a devotee of [Urgathoa](../../setting/deities/urgathoa.md), you can use this scythe as a divine focus, and with every [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), it exudes a pallid cloud of powdery dust.

You deal `1d10` negative damage to yourself. If your next action is to [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the scythe or to [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with the [disease](../../../rules/traits/disease.md) or [negative](../../../rules/traits/negative.md) trait, that [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) or spell deals additional negative damage equal to the damage you took (after any reductions or increases from immunity, resistances, weaknesses).
