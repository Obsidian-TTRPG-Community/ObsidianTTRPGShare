# Bloodhound Mask *Item 2+*  
[alchemical](../../../rules/traits/alchemical.md)  [consumable](../../../rules/traits/consumable.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Activate** [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Consumable

This wide, single-use mask is designed to be slipped over your mouth and nose and its alchemical filter activated all with one hand. Once activated, the mask sharpens odors, giving you imprecise scent with the listed range. You can't wear other masks while you're wearing a bloodhound mask.

When you use [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) to [Track](../../../rules/actions/track.md) a creature by its scent, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level even if you're untrained, and the mask grants you the listed item bonus to your [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) check. The GM sets the [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) DC based on the area's ability to hold scent rather than on visual clues, as normal for using scent.
