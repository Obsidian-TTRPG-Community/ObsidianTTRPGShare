These compacted pellets of bat guano, sulfur, and magical accelerants have long been a staple for spellcasters on the battlefield. Adding a firestarter pellet to a [fireball](../../spells/fireball.md) spell produces clinging flames that deal [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to all who fail the saving throw against the effect (doubling on a critical failure).
