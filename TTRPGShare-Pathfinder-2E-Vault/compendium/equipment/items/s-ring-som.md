Each specialist's ring is dedicated to a single school of magic, and the ring is covered in symbols and glyphs related to that school according to the creator's arcane studies. A specialist's ring has the trait corresponding to its school of magic. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) checks, and a +1 circumstance bonus to recognize [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md) effects and items of the specific school of magic.
