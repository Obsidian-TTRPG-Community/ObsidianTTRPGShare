# Razmiri Wayfinder *Item 10*  
[illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 900 gp
- **Usage** worn; **Bulk** –
- **Category** Worn

Worn on a chain around the neck, a Razmiri wayfinder functions as a compass and provides its wearer a +1 item bonus to [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](../../../rules/actions/lie.md) or [Impersonate](../../../rules/actions/impersonate.md). Razmiri wayfinders can also be used to grant temporary healing, making it easier for the wearer to impersonate a divine spellcaster.

You touch an adjacent creature, granting them `3d8` temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You touch an adjacent creature and attempt a counteract check against one poison or disease afflicting the creature. On a success, you halt the effects of the poison or disease for 1 day, rather than removing it. This temporarily relieves any penalties imposed by the affliction but doesn't cure the effect or count against its duration; the poison or disease is merely halted for a time, and it resumes where it left off once this effect ends.
