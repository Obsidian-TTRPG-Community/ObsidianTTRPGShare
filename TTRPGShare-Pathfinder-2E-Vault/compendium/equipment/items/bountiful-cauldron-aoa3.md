This mid-sized, silver cauldron is a boon within areas where access to fresh food is limited, for it can be commanded to fill itself with hearty (and delicious) vegetable stew. It can also be put to a much greater use in the pursuit of crafting certain items.

When used to [Craft](../../../rules/actions/craft.md) alchemical items, potions, or oils, a bountiful cauldron grants a +2 item bonus to the [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) check.

You stir the cauldron, and it casts a 4th-level [create food](../../../compendium/spells/create-food.md) spell, filling itself with enough delicious vegetable stew to feed 12 Medium creatures.
