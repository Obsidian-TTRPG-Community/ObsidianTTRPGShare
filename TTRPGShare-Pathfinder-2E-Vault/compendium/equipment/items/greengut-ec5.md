This watery, mint-green emetic of xulgath design is often carried in a delicate obsidian vial or other fragile container.

In the unfortunate circumstance that a creature has been Swallowed Whole by another creature, the swallowed creature can break open a vial of greengut to immediately induce vomiting. The swallower must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or take `18d6` poison damage and possibly vomit the contents of its stomach.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage, is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), and vomits up any and all creatures Swallowed Whole on its next turn (a single action, which also allows it a Fortitude save against the [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition), as well as any stones or other objects it swallowed.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
