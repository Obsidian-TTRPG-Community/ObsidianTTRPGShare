This plain silver ring has an almost oily sheen. While wearing the ring, you gain a +2 item bonus to [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

Snapping your fingers on the hand that wears the ring causes the ring to cast [glibness](../../../compendium/spells/glibness.md) on you with no visual manifestations of a spell being cast.
