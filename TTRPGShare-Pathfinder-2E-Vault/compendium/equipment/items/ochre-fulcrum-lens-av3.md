This brownish-orange lens always seems dusty and gritty, even when wet. While you have the Ochre Fulcrum Lens invested, lassitude grips you. You gain resistance 10 to mental damage and a +2 status bonus to saves against [emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effects. You can also activate the lens in the following ways.
