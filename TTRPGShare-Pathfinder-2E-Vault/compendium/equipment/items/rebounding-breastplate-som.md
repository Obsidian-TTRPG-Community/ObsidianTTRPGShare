# Rebounding Breastplate *Item 20*  
[evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [force](../../../rules/traits/force.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 70000 gp
- **Usage** worn armor
- **Category** Armor

This +3 greater resilient greater fortification breastplate absorbs impacts for later release. While wearing the armor, you gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and resistance 10 to force damage.

Keep track of how much damage the armor prevents from enemy attacks, as the armor absorbs that damage.

After 1 minute, the absorbed damage disperses harmlessly and resets to 0. Only damage caused by foes or hazards powers the armor, not damage you take from yourself, allies, or the environment.

- **Requirements**: Your armor has absorbed at least 30 damage

**Effect** The absorbed energy explodes from your armor in a pulse of force. Creatures in a 30-foot emanation take `10d6` force damage with a DC 43 basic Fortitude save. On a failure, they're pushed 10 feet away from you, and on a critical failure, they're pushed 20 feet away from you and fall [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). The armor's absorbed damage resets to 0.
