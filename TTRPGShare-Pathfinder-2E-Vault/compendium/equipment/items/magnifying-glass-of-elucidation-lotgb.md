These well-aged wooden magnifying glasses are engraved with a variety of runes. Each is imbued with a specific language.

When you use a magnifying glass to examine writing of its imbued language, it translates the writing into a language Urban Garden Wares you understand. For example, an elf who speaks only Elven using a magnifying glass of elucidation imbued with Dwarven would see Dwarven writing as Elven when [observed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Observed) through the magnifying glass. The magnifying glass only provides direct translations and doesn't automatically allow you to understand codes or extremely esoteric passages—you still need to attempt a skill check to [Decipher Writing](../../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

You scan up to two pages of writing with the magnifying glass of elucidation, imbuing the magnifying glass with the information you scanned. You can use a separate 3-action activity to have the magnifying glass reproduce the imbued information onto blank paper exactly as it appeared when you Activated the magnifying glass. The reproduction is a direct copy of the pages but doesn't imbue the reproduction with any [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md) effects or other special effects. As such, you can copy the writing of a scroll, for example, but it will only be mundane writing and not have any [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md) effect. The magnifying glass can only hold one instance of information at a given time; [Activating](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the magnifying glass a second time or reproducing the information clears out the magnifying glass's information.
