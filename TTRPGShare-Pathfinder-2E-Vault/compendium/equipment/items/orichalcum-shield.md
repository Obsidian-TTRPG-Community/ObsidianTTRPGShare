# Orichalcum Shield *Item 17+*  
[rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** varies by shield
- **Category** Shield; **Group** Shield 

Orichalcum shields' time-bending properties are particularly useful for keeping them intact. The first time each day an orichalcum shield would be destroyed, it is instead left with 1 Hit Point and the [broken](../../../rules/conditions.md#Broken) condition.
