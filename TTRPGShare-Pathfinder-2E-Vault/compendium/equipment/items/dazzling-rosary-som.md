When energy courses through these lustrous beads, they glow brightly in the sacred colors of the spellcaster's faith. A spiritual weapon empowered with this catalyst flashes with bright light when it critically [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) a target, causing the target to be [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the beginning of your next turn. The type of rosary determines the maximum spell level of spiritual weapon that can use the rosary as a catalyst.
