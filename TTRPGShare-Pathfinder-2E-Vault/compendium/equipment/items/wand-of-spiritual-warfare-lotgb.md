In addition, you can etch one of the following property runes onto the wand: [corrosive](../../../compendium/equipment/items/corrosive.md), [flaming](../../../compendium/equipment/items/flaming.md), [frost](../../../compendium/equipment/items/frost.md), [shock](../../../compendium/equipment/items/shock.md), [thundering](../../../compendium/equipment/items/thundering.md), or their respective greater versions.
