# Throwing Shield *Item 1*  
[adjustment](../../../rules/traits/adjustment-lotgb.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this item.
- **Price** 5 gp
- **Usage** applied to a buckler or shield
- **Category** Adjustment

These special straps and weightings fit over a shield or buckler, but not a tower shield. They are designed to let you doff and throw the shield in one swift movement. You can quickly remove the shield by spending a free action as part of the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) to throw the shield. When thrown in this way, the shield is a martial thrown weapon that deals `1d6` bludgeoning damage and has the thrown <20 feet> trait. A shield with the throwing shield attachment can't have any attached weapons, such as shield spikes or a shield boss, and the adjustments to make it more aerodynamic make it slightly less sturdy, reducing its Hardness by 1.
