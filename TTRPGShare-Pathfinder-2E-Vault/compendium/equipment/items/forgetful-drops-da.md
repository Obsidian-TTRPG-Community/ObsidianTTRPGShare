These innocuous, colorless drops can be poured directly into a victim's mouth, or slipped into their food or drink. They initially haze a victim's mind slightly, making them easier to fool; in later stages, they can lead to the victim entering a murderous [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) state. Secret societies use these drops to befuddle a target or to frame them for violence.
