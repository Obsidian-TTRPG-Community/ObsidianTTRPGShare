The springy soles of these sturdy leather boots cushion your feet and make each step lighter. These boots give you a +5-foot item bonus to your Speed and a +2 item bonus to [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks to [High Jump](../../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) and [Long Jump](../../../rules/actions/long-jump.md). In addition, when you use the [Leap](../../../rules/actions/leap.md) action, you can move 5 feet further if jumping horizontally or 3 feet higher if jumping vertically.
