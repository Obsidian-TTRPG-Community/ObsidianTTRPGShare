Similar to the blunderbuss, a dragon-mouth pistol fires pellets from a flared barrel. Though less powerful than a blunderbuss, the dragon-mouth pistol is appreciated for its portability and one-handed design. Though the name was coined because of the destructive belch of this handheld scatter weapon, many gunsmiths craft dragon-mouth pistols with elaborate embellishments that resemble a stylized dragon's maw framing the barrel.
