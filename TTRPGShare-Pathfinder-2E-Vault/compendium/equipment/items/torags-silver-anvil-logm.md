This portable silver anvil has a narrow hoop on one end, through which a long, sturdy chain has been strung.

Torag's Silver Anvil can be wielded as a +3 holy greater flaming greater striking silver meteor hammer.

Outside of combat, the anvil can be used with a hammer as an incredibly effective portable forge, heating up the metal to be forged without a furnace and granting a +3 item bonus to [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) checks involving metalworking. When you use the anvil to successfully [Repair](../../../rules/actions/repair.md) a metal item, the item recovers an additional 10 Hit Points (or an additional 20 on a critical success).
