# Tower Shield *Item 0*  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Bulk** 4
- **AC Bonus** +2/+2; **null Hardness** 5, **null HP** 20 (BT 10); **Speed Penalty** -5 ft.
- **Category** Shield; **Group** Shield 

These massive shields can be used to provide cover to nearly the entire body. Due to their size, they are typically made of wood reinforced with metal.

> [!pf2-note]
> When you have a [tower shield](../../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/equipment/items/tower-shield.md) raised, you can use the [Take Cover](../../../rules/actions/take-cover.md) action to increase the circumstance bonus to AC to +4. This lasts until the shield is no longer raised. If you would normally provide lesser cover against an attack, having your tower shield raised provides standard cover against it (and other creatures can [Take Cover](../../../rules/actions/take-cover.md) as normal using the cover from your shield).
