This +2 holy greater striking glaive has a long, multi-tailed rainbow-colored banner affixed to the butt of the pole in the style of Shelyn's religious symbol. While wielding the glaive, you gain a +2 item bonus on [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) and [Performance](../../skills.md#Performance) checks.

You furl one of the colored tails around the pole, causing the glaive to gain the effects of your choice of the corrosive, flaming, frost, shocking, or thundering property runes for 1 round, depending on the tail you chose.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You thrust the blade of the glaive into the ground, activating the power of the banner. (The blade can penetrate any non-metallic surface when used in this way, and does not leave a mark when withdrawn.) As long as the glaive is thrust into the ground and standing upright, all allies within 60 feet who can see the glaive's banner gain a +2 item bonus to [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks.
