This bright red-and-gold cape is often interlaced with glittery threads and serves as a distraction. While wearing the cape, you gain a +2 item bonus to [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) checks.

title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You cast [dimension door](../../../compendium/spells/dimension-door.md). The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with puffs of smoke that make anyone within [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) until they leave the smoke or the end of your next turn, at which point the smoke dissipates.

Strong winds immediately disperse the smoke.
