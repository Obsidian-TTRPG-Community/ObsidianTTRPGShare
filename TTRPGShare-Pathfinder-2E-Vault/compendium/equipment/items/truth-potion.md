For 10 minutes after drinking this astringent potion, you can't intentionally lie and may be compelled to tell the truth.

Upon drinking the potion, attempt a DC 19 Will save. You can voluntarily fail or critically fail.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The potion does not affect you.
> - **Failure** When you speak, you must tell the truth.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and when someone asks you a question, you must attempt another DC 19 Will saving throw. If you fail this saving throw, you must answer the question truthfully if you are able to do so; if you succeed, you are temporarily immune to further attempts to ask the same question within the potion's duration.
