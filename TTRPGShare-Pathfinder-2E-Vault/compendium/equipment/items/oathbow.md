Constructed of a flexible, white wood and with ornate, twisting designs carved into its surface, this +2 striking composite longbow appears to have been made by elves. Sometimes when you loose an arrow, its whistling in flight sounds like a voice whispering in Elven, wishing for the swift defeat of your enemies.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You swear an oath to destroy one creature you can see. For the next 7 days or until that creature is slain, your attacks with the bow against that creature deal `1d6` additional damage, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Survival](../../../compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks to [Track](../../../rules/actions/track.md) that creature. Your critical hits against the target gain the bow's critical specialization effect (page 283); if they would already do so, they instead increase the DC of the [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) when critically hit to DC 20.

After you activate the bow, you can't activate it again for 7 days. If you kill the creature you've sworn an oath against, the oath ends and you need to wait only 10 minutes before you can activate it again.
