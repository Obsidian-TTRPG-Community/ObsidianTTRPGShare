# Rhythm Bone *Item 1*  
[auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Held

This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually capped with metal at its ends. It's activated by striking it against a hard surface.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The bone begins recording the next 1 minute of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 15 or lower [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) check to hear.

The bone's recording doesn't copy magical [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy's song, or a banshee's wail. Once the rhythm bone has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The bone replays its recorded sounds.
