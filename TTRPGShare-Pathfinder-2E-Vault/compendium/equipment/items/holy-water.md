This vial contains water blessed by a good deity. You activate a vial of holy water by throwing it as a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait to the attack made with it.

Holy water deals `1d6` good damage and 1 good splash damage. It damages only fiends, undead, and creatures that have a weakness to good damage.
