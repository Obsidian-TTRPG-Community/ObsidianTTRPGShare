# Snake Oil *Item 1*

You can apply snake oil onto a wound or other outward symptom of an affliction or condition (such as sores from a disease or discoloration from a poison). For the next hour, the symptom disappears and the [wounded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) or afflicted creature doesn't feel as if it still has the wound or affliction, though all effects remain. A creature can uncover the ruse by succeeding at a DC 17 [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check, but only if it uses a [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) action to specifically examine the snake oil's effects.
