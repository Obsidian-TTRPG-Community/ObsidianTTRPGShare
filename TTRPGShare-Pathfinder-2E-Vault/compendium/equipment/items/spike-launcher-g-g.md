Built from the spiked tail of a manticore, a spike launcher is designed to launch large, spear-like projectiles. A spike launcher is a +1 striking weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals `1d8` piercing damage. It has the backstabber, fatal aim d12, and kickback traits with a range increment of 120 feet and reload <2>. It uses the critical specialization of the bow weapon group, rather than the firearm critical specialization.

[evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Requirements**: The spike launcher is loaded

**Effect** The spike launcher fires a volley of smaller spikes in a 10-foot burst centered anywhere within its range.

Make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the spike launcher against each creature in the area. On a success, the spike causes the creature to take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speed.

On a critical success, the creature becomes [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to remove the spike and end the penalty or [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) condition.
