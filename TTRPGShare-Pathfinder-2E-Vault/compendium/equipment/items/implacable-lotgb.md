# Implacable *Item 11*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 1200 gp
- **Usage** etched onto medium or heavy armor
- **Category** Rune

This substantial rune makes you difficult to hold back.

Whenever you are affected by an effect that lasts until you [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) (for instance, from the [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md) action or a tanglefoot bag), you become [quickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened). You can use the extra action each round only to [Step](../../../rules/actions/step.md) or [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md).
