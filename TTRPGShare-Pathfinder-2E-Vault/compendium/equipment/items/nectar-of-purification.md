A shimmering liquid, nectar of purification is often stored in bottles similar to those used for vinegar. This oil casts a 1st-level [purify food and drink](../../spells/purify-food-and-drink.md) spell over any food or drink onto which it's poured. The nectar evaporates as it takes effect, leaving the taste and texture of the food or drink unaltered.
