- **Category** Holsters

This incredibly spacious bandolier can hold up to 4 onehanded crossbows or firearms that take no more than 1 action to completely reload (typically meaning that weapons with the capacity or repeating traits won't fit in the bandolier's holsters). A gunner's bandolier can be etched with runes as though it were a ranged weapon. When you invest the gunner's bandolier, you can attune it to each of the 4 weapons holstered in it.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You empower one of the attuned weapons in the bandolier, granting it the runes etched onto the gunner's bandolier and removing the runes from any previously drawn weapon. Then, you [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw the weapon.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

All weapons that were attuned to the bandolier when you invested it, not including any weapons you're currently wielding, return to the bandolier, and one of the returned weapons is automatically reloaded.
