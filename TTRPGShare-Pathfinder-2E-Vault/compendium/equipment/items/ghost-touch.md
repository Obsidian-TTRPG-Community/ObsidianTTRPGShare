The weapon can harm creatures without physical form. A ghost touch weapon is particularly effective against incorporeal creatures, which almost always have a specific weakness to ghost touch weapons. Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield ghost touch weapons (unlike most physical objects).
