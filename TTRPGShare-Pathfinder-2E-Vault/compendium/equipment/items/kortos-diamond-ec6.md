# Kortos Diamond *Item 22*  
[artifact](../../../rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md)  [divine](../../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [unique](../../../rules/traits/unique.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Artifact

The hilt of this +3 major striking axiomatic spell-storing longsword is simple and elegant. The blade itself is made of throneglass—a clear, jewellike crafting material with a razor-sharp edge, capable of absorbing psychic magic and redirecting it at the wielder's enemies.

Whenever the Kortos Diamond is in an area of dim or brighter light, it glows faintly, as if reflecting the light of a setting sun.

While wielding the Kortos Diamond, you gain a +2 item bonus on saving throws against [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects. You can never harm yourself with the Kortos Diamond, even if [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused).

If you ever travel farther than 100 miles from the Isle of Kortos while in possession of the Kortos Diamond, the sword becomes impossibly heavy; you are [encumbered](../../../rules/conditions.md#Encumbered) as long as you carry the sword and remain outside of this area. If you relinquish the Kortos Diamond while away from Kortos, the sword gradually makes its way back to the isle over the course of a year.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You attempt a melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the Kortos Diamond against a creature within reach. On a hit, you deal damage as normal and the target's mind is inflicted with a powerful disruptive energy.

When the creature attempts to [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), it must attempt a DC 44 Will save; on a failure, the spell fails and both the spell and the actions spent to cast it are lost. This effect lasts for up to 1 minute.
```

You hold the Kortos Diamond aloft and proclaim your might in a booming voice. You cast [overwhelming presence](../../../compendium/spells/overwhelming-presence.md) (DC 42)
