# Murderer's Knot *Item 7*  
[consumable](../../../rules/traits/consumable.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [talisman](../../../rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 66 gp
- **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** command; **Trigger** You damage a [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature with a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) using the affixed weapon; **Requirements** You are an expert with the affixed weapon.
- **Category** Talisman

This black strand of leather is tied to look like a peace knot when the weapon is stowed, but it doesn't hamper drawing the weapon. When you activate the knot, the creature you damaged takes `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

If you have the Twist the Knife feat, the talisman instead deals [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to your sneak attack damage.
