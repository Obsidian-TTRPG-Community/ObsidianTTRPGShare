Leafy stalks protrude from the shaft of this rustic arrow. When an activated vine arrow hits a target, the arrow's shaft splits and grows, wrapping the target in vines. The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for `2d4` rounds, or until it [Escapes](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) against a DC of 19. On a critical hit, the target is also [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it [Escapes](../../../rules/actions/escape.md).
