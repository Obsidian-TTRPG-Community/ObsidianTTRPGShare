# Abysium Weapon *Item 12+*  
[rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon
- **Category** Weapon

Abysium weapons are safe to carry, as the toxic metal is contained within an outer shell. However, the inherent toxicity in these blue-green weapons can irradiate open wounds and poison foes. Abysium weapons have one fewer property rune slot, but they deal `1d4` poison damage on a successful [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), and on a critical hit, the target is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), or [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) with high-grade abysium.
