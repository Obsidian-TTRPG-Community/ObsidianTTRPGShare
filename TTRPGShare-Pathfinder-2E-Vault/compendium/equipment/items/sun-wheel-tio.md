Created by the priests of a Qadiran sect of Sarenites, the sun wheels were designed to protect the Dawnflower's followers in their quest to hunt down a dangerous cult trying to raise a spawn of the evil god [Rovagug](../../setting/deities/rovagug.md). Once they completed their crusade, these priests disbanded and went on to minister other congregations. They each took their sun wheels with them, handing them down to the next generations.

This copper medallion is etched with a stylized sun, its rays shaped like the spokes of a wagon wheel. It tends to glint brightly when exposed to sunlight. While wearing this pendant, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) checks.

You must be good-aligned to use the sun wheel's true power: the following activation, which provides you a shield of burning force.

Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") (concentrate) Effect The sun wheel casts a [shield](../../spells/shield.md) spell benefiting you (Hero's Handbook 22). When you use the spell to prevent damage, you prevent 10 damage instead of 5. If the attacker is adjacent to you, you can choose to deal `2d6` fire damage to it, which it gets a DC 21 basic Reflex save to resist.

If you choose to deal the fire damage, you can't Activate the sun wheel again until the next morning.

If you prevent damage but don't deal the fire damage, you can use it again in 10 minutes, as normal for shield.
