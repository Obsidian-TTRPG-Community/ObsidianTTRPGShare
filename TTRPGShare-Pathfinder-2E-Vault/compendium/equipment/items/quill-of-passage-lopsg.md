```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

Placing the tip of the quill against a wall of wood, plaster, or stone and speaking a command word causes the ink to flow from the nib onto the wall in the shape of a glowing doorway, casting passwall on the touched surface.
