A shard of the Orb of Gold Dragonkind resembles a pointed length of crystal about the size and shape of a shortsword without a hilt. It functions as a +3 striking shortsword that deals `2d6` extra damage to dragons.

Each orb shard within 60 feet of the flawed orb of Gold Dragonkind increases the save DC against the orb by 1; thus, if all 13 remaining orb shards are in this area, the save DC against the flawed orb increases from DC 30 to DC 43. A talented spellcaster or crafter can integrate an orb shard back into the flawed orb to make this DC increase permanent.
