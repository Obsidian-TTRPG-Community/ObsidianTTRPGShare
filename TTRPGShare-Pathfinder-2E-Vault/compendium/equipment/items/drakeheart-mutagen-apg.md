# Drakeheart Mutagen *Item 1+*  
[alchemical](../../../rules/traits/alchemical.md)  [consumable](../../../rules/traits/consumable.md)  [elixir](../../../rules/traits/elixir.md)  [mutagen](../../../rules/traits/mutagen.md)  [polymorph](../../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Activate** [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Elixir

Your skin grows tough scales like a drake, your eyesight become sharp and your pupils slitted, and your limbs grow wiry and quick, but your mind and reflexes become slow.

**Benefit** You gain the listed bonus to AC, a Dexterity cap of +2 (as usual, use your lowest Dexterity cap if you have more than one), and an item bonus to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks. If you're wearing armor, you still calculate your proficiency bonus to AC based on your proficiency in the armor you're wearing, even if the drakeheart mutagen has a higher item bonus.

You also gain the Final Surge action.

```

**Drawback** You take a –1 penalty to Will saves, Reflex saves, and all skill checks to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).
