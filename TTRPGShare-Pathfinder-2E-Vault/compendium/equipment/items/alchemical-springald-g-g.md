`10d6` damage and 3 splash damage, three different targets within a 15-foot burst, DC 30 Reflex. The damage type depends on the alchemical ammunition used: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Creatures take the splash damage only once from the launch, even if they're in the area of more than one of the three splashes.
