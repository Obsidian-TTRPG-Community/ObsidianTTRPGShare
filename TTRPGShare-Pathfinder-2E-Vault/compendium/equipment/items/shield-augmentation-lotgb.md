There are numerous methods to modify shields—snarling rods to catch weapons, bladed edges, padding for nonlethal strikes, and so on—but all share basic functionality. A shield augmentation can be etched with weapon runes, much like a shield boss or shield spikes, but doesn't otherwise alter your shield's statistics. A shield bearing an augmentation can't be combined with an attached weapon, like shield spikes.

A shield augmentation grants your shield one or more weapon traits, chosen when the augmentation is created. You can either choose to add the [backswing](../../../rules/traits/backswing.md) or [forceful](../../../rules/traits/forceful.md) trait, or you can choose two of the following weapon traits: [disarm](../../../rules/traits/disarm.md), [nonlethal](../../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [shove](../../../rules/traits/shove.md), [thrown <10 feet>](../../../rules/traits/thrown.md), [trip](../../../rules/traits/trip.md), or versatile S.
