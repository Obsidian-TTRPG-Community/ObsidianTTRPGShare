```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage

**Effect** The weapon becomes imbued with the triggering energy type. It deals an additional `1d8` damage of the triggering type until the end of your next turn. As normal, if you use this reaction again during the duration, the damage doesn't combine; instead, change the `1d8` damage to the new triggering type of damage and change the duration to the end of your next turn.
