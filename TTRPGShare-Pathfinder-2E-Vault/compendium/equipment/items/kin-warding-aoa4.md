A kin-warding clan dagger can deflect attacks aimed at your allies. When you use the weapon's [parry](../../../rules/traits/parry.md) trait, you can point the clan dagger at an adjacent ally instead of defending yourself, creating a shield of runes around them. The runic barrier grants your ally the weapon's circumstance bonus to AC, but you do not gain the bonus yourself.
