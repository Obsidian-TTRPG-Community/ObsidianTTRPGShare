This hat comes in many forms, such as a colorful turban or a pointy hat with a brim, and can bear symbols or runes. It grants you a +1 item bonus to [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) checks and allows you to cast the [prestidigitation](../../spells/prestidigitation.md) cantrip as an arcane innate spell.
