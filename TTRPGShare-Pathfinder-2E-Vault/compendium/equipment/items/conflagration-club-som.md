```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from a spell slot, and the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, [fire](../../../rules/traits/fire.md), or [sonic](../../../rules/traits/sonic.md) trait
- **Requirements**: The club has no charges

**Effect** You mentally align the club's crystals to reverberate with energy from the spell. It gains a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot, and the charges are attuned to the damage type matching the spell's trait. If the spell has more than one eligible trait, choose one when the charges are stored.

- **Requirements**: The club has at least 1 charge

**Effect** You flip the club around to blast a cone of energy from its base. Each creature in a 15-foot cone takes `1d6` damage per charge stored in the club, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC or DC 19, whichever is greater. The damage type is the same type the charges were attuned to. The club loses all of its charges.
