This sealed pewter urn contains the ashes of a benevolent ancestor, with a sliver of lingering spirit that strives to protect you.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You would become [doomed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) or your [doomed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) value would increase
- **Requirements**: The ashes aren't [doomed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed)

**Effect** The ashes in the urn intervene, taking the [doomed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) condition in your place, and you don't gain or increase the value of your own [doomed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) condition. Each night when you get a full night's rest, you can reduce your own [doomed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) condition or that of the urn, but not both.
```

The urn shoots a bolt of negative energy at a foe within 30 feet. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's AC, using a modifier of +15 or your own spell attack roll modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, the bolt deals `4d4` negative damage (doubled on a critical success).
