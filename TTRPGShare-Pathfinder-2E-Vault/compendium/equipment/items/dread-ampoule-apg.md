This flask is filled with a murky purple gas that briefly interferes with normal brain activity. A dread ampoule deals the listed mental damage and mental splash damage.

On a hit, the target becomes [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit. Many types also grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
