This oddly fuzzy buckler (Hardness 10, HP 60, BT 30) resembles the abdomen of a spider. Its defensive side is covered in fine hairs, and two small spinnerets protrude from the bottom of its rim. The spinnerets serve as +2 greater striking shield spikes.

You animate the silkspinner's shield. Eight spider legs sprout from the shield's rim, granting you a climb Speed of 25 feet until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the spinnerets animate and produce silk for 1 minute.

Successful shield bash [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) made with the silkspinner's shield during this time entangle the target in silk. The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. If your [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit, the target becomes [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round instead. Regardless, the target can attempt to [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) (DC 30) to end the effect early.
