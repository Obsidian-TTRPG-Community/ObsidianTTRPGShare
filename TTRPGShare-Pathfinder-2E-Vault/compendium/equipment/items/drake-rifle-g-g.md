A drake rifle is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a drake. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a +1 weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals `1d10` damage with a range increment of 150 feet and reload <1>. It deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the drake from which it was made. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take persistent damage of the same type as the weapon equal to `1d4` + the number of weapon damage dice. A drake rifle does not add critical specialization effects.

You fire a large, specialized burst designed to hamper your foes. Make a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the drake rifle. As long as the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) isn't a critical failure, the drake rifle deals 1 splash damage per weapon damage die to the target and creatures within 5 feet of the target. This splash damage is of the same type as its normal damage.

On a hit, the drake rifle provides one of the following additional effects based on its damage type:

- **Acid** Clinging acid makes it painful and sickening to move. The target becomes [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
- **Cold** Frozen spittle clings to the target. The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.
- **Electricity** Small bursts of electricity continue to spark and jolt the target. The target becomes [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) and [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for `1d4` rounds.
- **Fire** A massive explosion knocks the target back. The target is pushed 10 feet away from you, and if it's on the ground, it falls [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
- **Poison** Noxious vapors fill the target's lungs. The target becomes [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) and [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 minute.
