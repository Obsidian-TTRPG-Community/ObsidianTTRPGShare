The type of animal tongue used in this tomato-based stew shifts from region to region, but it's always cooked with spirit of wine and seasoned with refined pesh. Eating this restaurant-staff favorite empowers you to speak and understand a single language for 1 hour. This must be a language the stew's cook could speak and understand, chosen at the time of the stew's creation. It also helps your words land smoothly, granting you a +2 item bonus to [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) checks made in that language for the same duration. It doesn't allow you to read the newly acquired language in its written form.
