# Dread Blindfold *Item 17*  
[emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [fear](../../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Usage** worn eyepiece
- **Category** Worn

When tied over your eyes, this ragged strip of black linen gives you a +3 item bonus to [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation) checks and [darkvision](../../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md). You can see through the blindfold, but only using [darkvision](../../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md).

The first time a particular creature sees you in a day, it must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened). This is an emotion, [fear](../../../rules/traits/fear.md), and [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect, and your allies become immune to it after about a week.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [F](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: You damage a creature with a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md)

**Effect** Your target is gripped by intense fear. This has the effect of a DC 37 [phantasmal killer](../../../compendium/spells/phantasmal-killer.md) spell, but it is an enchantment instead of an illusion. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
