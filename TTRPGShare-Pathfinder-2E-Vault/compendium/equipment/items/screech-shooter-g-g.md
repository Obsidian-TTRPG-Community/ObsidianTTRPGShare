Built from the larynx of an owlbear, terror shrike, or similar animal that possesses a frightening screech or similar special ability, a screech shooter is a special +1 striking harmona gun designed to fire terrifying blasts of sound. A screech shooter deals sonic damage but can otherwise be used like a normal harmona gun.
