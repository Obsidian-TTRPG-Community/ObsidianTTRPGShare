# Burnished Plating *Item 1*  
[adjustment](../../../rules/traits/adjustment-lotgb.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 5 gp
- **Usage** applied to metal armor; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Armor

These highly polished metal plates can be added to any armor. While wearing armor with burnished plating, you gain the Sunshine! reaction. However, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) checks except in darkness, and your armor's Strength entry increases its value by 2, requiring you to have a higher Strength score to overcome the armor's penalties. Even if you meet your armor's new Strength entry, you still take the penalty to [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) checks. When you are critically hit by an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, burnished plating stops working until someone spends 10 minutes repairing and polishing it; this doesn't require a [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) check.

title: Sunshine! [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature you can see targets you with an attack
- **Requirements**: You are in an area of bright light

**Effect** You twist to reflect light in your foe's eyes. The attacking creature must succeed at a DC 3 flat check or the attack fails. The attacker doesn't need to roll this flat check if it has a precise sense other than vision or if it would already need to roll a flat check with a higher DC to target you, such as if you are [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden).
