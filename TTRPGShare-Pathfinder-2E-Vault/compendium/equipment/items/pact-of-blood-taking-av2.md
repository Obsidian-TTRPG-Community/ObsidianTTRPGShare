# Pact Of Blood-taking *Item 5*  
[contract](../../../rules/traits/contract-lol.md)  [invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Devil** barbazu; **Decipher Writing** [Society](../../skills.md#Society), [Warfare Lore](../../skills.md#Lore)
- **Category** Contract

You negotiate for might and viciousness.

**Benefit** Your successful [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with slashing and piercing melee weapons deal 1 [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). On a critical success, this [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is equal to half your level.

**Payment** You regain half the normal number of Hit Points from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term rest) and from any application of the [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) skill.

**Hidden Condition** The barbazu owns any weapons you find. No more often than once per month, the barbazu can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand over the weapon immediately, without question.

**Termination Clause** The contract guarantees that you will not "be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action." This wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die from [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from any source, the contract is voided.
