Carried by many Knights of Lastwall, this amber-colored, fragrant-smelling oil is meant to prevent those who fall in battle from rising as undead. Applying anointing oil to a corpse casts gentle repose on it. The effects last for 24 hours.

The oil is repugnant to the undead. An undead creature that touches a corpse treated with this oil is [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the contact is [broken](../../../rules/conditions.md#Broken) or the oil's effect wears off.
