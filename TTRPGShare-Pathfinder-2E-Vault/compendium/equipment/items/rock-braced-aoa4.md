Rock-braced armor makes you as hard to move as a boulder. Whenever another creature attempts to forcibly move you from your space, you gain a +4 item bonus to your Fortitude DC against the check to move you. If the creature would not normally need to attempt a check to move you, then the creature must succeed at an [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) check against your Fortitude DC (including the +4 item bonus) or you are unmoved.

Clan Dagger Runes Clan daggers are weapons of great cultural and personal significance to many dwarves. The following runes were invented specifically to enhance clan daggers, but they can be applied to any weapon that meets the runes' requirements.
