This aromatic potion is brewed from the white flowers and black roots of the magical herb moly. When you drink this potion, it immediately attempts to counteract all [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md) effects affecting you. For the next hour, you gain an item bonus against [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md) effects, which is greater against [polymorph](../../../rules/traits/polymorph.md) effects. If you roll a success against a [polymorph](../../../rules/traits/polymorph.md) effect during that time, you get a critical success instead.
