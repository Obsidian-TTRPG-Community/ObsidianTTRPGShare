- **Usage** worn eyepiece
- **Category** Worn

This rugged metal eyepiece etched with square patterns is designed to be worn over a single eye. Twisting the lens reveals a faint three-dimensional outline of an item you plan to build or repair, with helpful labels on the component parts. While worn, this eyepiece gives you a +1 item bonus to [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) checks. When you [Repair](../../../rules/actions/repair.md) an item, increase the Hit Points restored by 15 per proficiency rank instead of 10.
