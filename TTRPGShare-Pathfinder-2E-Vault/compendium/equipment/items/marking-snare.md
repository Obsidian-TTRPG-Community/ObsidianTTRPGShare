This snare is often used to mark intruders for later tracking or identification. When you create this snare, you must decide whether to make it a dye or a scent marker. Either type of marking grants a +2 circumstance bonus to [Track](../../../rules/actions/track.md) the creature for up to 24 hours or until the dye or scent is washed off (requiring at least a gallon of water and 10 minutes of scrubbing). A creature that enters a square of the snare must attempt a DC 17 Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The snare marks the creature.
> - **Critical Failure** The snare marks the creature, and the creature is [blinded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of its next turn.
