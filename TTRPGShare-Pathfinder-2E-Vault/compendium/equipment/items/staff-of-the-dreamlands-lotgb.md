The carved night hag's hand at the end of this sandalwood staff clutches a rough gem. The staff of the Dreamlands makes it easier to navigate and survive in the Dreamlands and recognize its denizens. When wielding the staff, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) checks while in the Dreamlands and to checks to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about creatures with the [dream](../../../rules/traits/dream-b2.md) trait.

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
