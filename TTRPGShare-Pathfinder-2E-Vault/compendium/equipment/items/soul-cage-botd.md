As you [Craft](../../../rules/actions/craft.md) your soul cage, you trap your soul within it, an integral part of the complicated process of becoming a lich.

When you're destroyed, your soul flees to the soul cage, which rebuilds your undead body over the course of `1d10` days. Afterward, you manifest next to the soul cage, fully healed and in a new body (lacking any equipment you had on your old body). Only destroying your soul cage can prevent you from returning.

You choose the form of your soul cage when you [Craft](../../../rules/actions/craft.md) it. A few options include a miniature cage, a ring, an amulet, or a crown. Work with your GM to adjust the usage and Bulk as needed, though a soul cage is rarely more than light Bulk. The soul cage has Hardness 9 and 36 HP.

If your soul cage is destroyed but you aren't, you can attempt to find your soul and trap it again, building a new soul cage. This is no trivial feat and often takes an entire adventure to accomplish. If you don't cage your soul again, you suffer a long decline as described on page 119.
