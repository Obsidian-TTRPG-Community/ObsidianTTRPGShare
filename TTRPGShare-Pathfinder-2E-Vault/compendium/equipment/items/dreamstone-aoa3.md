A dreamstone is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to [Desna](../../setting/deities/desna.md)—be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a dreamstone, you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the dreamstone for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a dreamstone, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [sleep](../../../rules/traits/sleep.md) effects.

If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 4th level or lower that has the [sleep](../../../rules/traits/sleep.md) trait or is associated with dreams, the spell slot is not expended.
