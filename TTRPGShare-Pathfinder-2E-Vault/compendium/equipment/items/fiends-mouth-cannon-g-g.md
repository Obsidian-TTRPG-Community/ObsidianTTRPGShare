Fiend's mouth cannons are large-scale cannons designed to blast a target at great distance, from a stationary location.

They get their name from the fiendish features usually adorning their barrels and frames. Compared to a standard field cannon, a fiend's mouth cannon can be aimed more easily, but flexibility comes at the cost of mobility. The barrel rests on a platform which can be rotated 360 degrees to allow for precise aiming.
