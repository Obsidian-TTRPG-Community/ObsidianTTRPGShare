# Singing Shortbow *Item 14+*  
[enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

Rather than a normal bowstring, this +2 greater striking [thundering](thundering.md) [composite shortbow](composite-shortbow.md) has a string made of animal gut, much like a musical instrument's. When you shoot the bow, it releases a soft musical note—sonorous if your aim is true and discordant if your shot goes off-target.

[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  

You sing, hum, or whistle a note, and your bow provides appropriate accompaniment. Make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the bow. If it hits, the bow generates a [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md) effect determined by the note you sung, which has the traits indicated in parentheses. This affects every creature in a 10-foot emanation from the creature you hit. As normal for an emanation, you choose whether the creature you hit is affected.

- **Song of Soothing** ([emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md), [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md), [healing](../../../rules/traits/healing.md), [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)) Each creature regains `3d10` Hit Points and gains a +1 status bonus to saves against [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects for 1 minute.
- **Song of Suffering** ([evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md), [sonic](../../../rules/traits/sonic.md)) Each creature takes `3d10` sonic damage with a DC 31 basic Fortitude save.
