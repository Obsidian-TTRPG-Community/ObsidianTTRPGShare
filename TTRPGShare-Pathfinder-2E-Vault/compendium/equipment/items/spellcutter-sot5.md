The blade of this +2 greater striking adamantine longsword seems to absorb light from the air around it, giving the impression the wielder is standing in the shadow of a much larger creature. While Spellcutter is a potent weapon for battling undead and constructs, an ancient restriction on the blade prevents it from harming living creatures; attacks against living beings deal no damage. This restriction doesn't apply to dhampirs or creatures with the negative healing ability who are otherwise living; the magic of the blade can't distinguish between such beings and undead.

**Effect** Spellcutter attempts to absorb the magic of the triggering spell, giving you a +4 status bonus to your AC and saves against the effect.

Touching Spellcutter to any light source of 12th level or lower (including 6th-level spells with the [light](../../../rules/traits/light.md) trait) instantly extinguishes the effect. If the source of the light is a large flame, such as a forest fire or bonfire, it only extinguishes the light source in a 5-foot radius burst from the point of contact.
