A _ravenous_ curse draws power from the wielder's body. Whenever you [activate](../../../rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the item, you become incredibly hungry and immediately begin to starve ("_Core Rulebook" 500|CRB|10|Starvation and Thirst_). You require 10 times as much food as normal for the next day.
