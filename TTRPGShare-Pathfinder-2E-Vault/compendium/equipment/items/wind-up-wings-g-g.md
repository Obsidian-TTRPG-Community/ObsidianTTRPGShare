These delicate clockwork wings enable thrown weapons to soar through the air at high speeds, performing turns and other aerial maneuvers midflight. Wind-up wings also have different types of special effects depending on the type.

Wind-up wings must be attached to a thrown weapon and wound to function. A thrown weapon with an attached set of wind-up wings can't have anything else attached to it, or the wings cease to function.

Attaching or detaching a pair of wind-up wings to a thrown weapon requires a [repair kit](repair-kit.md), and the process takes 10 minutes. Winding an attached pair of wind-up wings takes three [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) actions. There are a variety of wind-up wings, with different effects.
