# Forge Warden *Item 10*  
[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 975 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Shield; **Group** Shield 

The religious symbol of Torag, the forge god—an ornate hammer of dwarven construction—adorns the face of this reinforced steel shield (Hardness 10, HP 24, BT 12). The shield is a religious symbol of Torag.

You and any adjacent allies have fire resistance 5 while you have the shield raised. When used for a [Shield Block](../../feats/shield-block.md), the forge warden rings out like the hammer strike of a blacksmith, and the symbol glows as if lit by the fires of a furnace.
