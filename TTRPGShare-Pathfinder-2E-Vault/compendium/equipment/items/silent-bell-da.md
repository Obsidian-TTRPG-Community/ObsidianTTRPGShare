This large handbell is made from cast bronze and has a wooden handle. The outside of the bell is covered in fine etchings, showing a group of varied people sitting around a table with clouds obscuring anyone in the background. The clapper is curiously absent from this bell and, when idly rung, it produces no audible sound.

The silent bell creates an [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) wall surrounding a cube, 20 feet to a side, that prevents sound from passing into or from the cube for 10 minutes. The wall isn't solid and doesn't prevent anything but sound from passing through. Since the cube is [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible), creatures can still read lips and body language through the wall.
