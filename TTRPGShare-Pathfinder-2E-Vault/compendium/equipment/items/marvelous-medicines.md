# Marvelous Medicines *Item 12+*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

This set of healer's tools contains a seemingly endless supply of bandages, herbs, and healing items of impeccable quality, granting you a +2 item bonus to [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You can activate the tools when you use them to [Treat Poison](../../../rules/actions/treat-poison.md) in order to produce the effects of neutralize poison, or when you [Treat Disease](../../../rules/actions/treat-disease.md) in order to produce the effects of remove disease. Once these medicines have been used to treat a patient's poison or disease, they can't be used again to treat the same affliction for that patient.
```
