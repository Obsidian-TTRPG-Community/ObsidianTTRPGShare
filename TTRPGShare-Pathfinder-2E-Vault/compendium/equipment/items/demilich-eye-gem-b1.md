This glowing gem is harvested from a demilich and has an 8th-level spell magically bonded to it. This item has the traits of the spell it contains.

title: Activate

The gem casts the 8th-level spell it contains. This activation uses the same number of actions as Casting the Spell. Once the spell is cast, the gem's glow fades, but returns 24 hours later, when the spell can be used once again.
