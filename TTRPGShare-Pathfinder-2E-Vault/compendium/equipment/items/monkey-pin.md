This small brass pin is in the shape of a monkey climbing a tree. When you activate this talisman, use a [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md) action.

If you succeed, you move your full Speed during the [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md). If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
