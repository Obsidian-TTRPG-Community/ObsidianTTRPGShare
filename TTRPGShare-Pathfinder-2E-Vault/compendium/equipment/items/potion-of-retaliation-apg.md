A potion of retaliation is available in four varieties—acid, cold, electricity, and fire—each with a faint shimmer reminiscent of the energy it contains. For 1 minute after drinking a potion of retaliation, you glow with a faint aura of that energy, and a creature that touches you (such as by making an unarmed attack or using a spell with a range of touch against you) takes damage of that type. The moderate, greater, and major versions also damage an adjacent creature that hits you with a melee weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).
