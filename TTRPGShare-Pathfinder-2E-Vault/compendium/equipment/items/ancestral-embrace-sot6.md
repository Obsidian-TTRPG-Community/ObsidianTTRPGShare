- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Artifact

This brightly colored +4 major resilient leather armor is inscribed with a spiral that has no end or beginning. Though it is a symbol of the ancient religion of Holy Xatramba, it also serves as a religious symbol of [Pharasma](../../setting/deities/pharasma.md). When you invest the armor, you gain negative resistance 25 and can draw on the power of your ancestors. You gain an ancestry feat from your ancestry; the feat can be any level, but you must meet any other prerequisites of the feat.

You lose the feat when the investment ends, and you can select a different feat each time you invest the armor again.
