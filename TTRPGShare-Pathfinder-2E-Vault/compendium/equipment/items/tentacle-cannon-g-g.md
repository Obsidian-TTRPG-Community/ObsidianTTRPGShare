A tentacle cannon is a +1 striking weapon, built using components from squids, krakens, and sometimes even stranger tentacled creatures like alghollthu. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals `1d8` piercing damage. It has the [capacity <5>](../../../rules/traits/capacity-g-g.md), [concussive](../../../rules/traits/concussive-g-g.md), and [fatal <d12>](../../../rules/traits/fatal.md) traits, a range increment of 30 feet, and [reload <2>](../../../rules/traits/reload.md). The weapon itself resembles a five-barreled handheld cannon with each barrel made from a hollowed out tentacle.

You cause one of the tentacles forming the weapon's five barrels to stretch out and attempt to pull and grab a creature within 15 feet. The tentacle attempts to [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md) with a +13 bonus. It can attempt to [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md) any creature, regardless of size. On a success, the tentacle pulls the creature up to 10 feet directly towards you, until it's in a square adjacent to you.

The cannon fires a spray of ink in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature is covered in ink and becomes [blinded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute or until it removes the ink. On a critical failure, the creature becomes [blinded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled); both conditions last for 1 minute or until it removes the ink. The creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to remove the ink from its eyes to remove the [blinded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) conditions.
