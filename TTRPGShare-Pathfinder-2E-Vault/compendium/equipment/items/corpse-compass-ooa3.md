This bone compass, made of the bones of sapient creatures that died violent deaths, is eerily effective when it comes to locating corpses. If you know you're Tracking a creature that's dead, you can use the compass's idiosyncrasies to your advantage and gain a +2 item bonus to your [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) check to do so. Otherwise, it works as a normal compass.
