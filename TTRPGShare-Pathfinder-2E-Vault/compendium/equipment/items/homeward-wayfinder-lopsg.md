Homeward wayfinders are powerful escape tools in the hands of a Pathfinder agent, drawing upon a special connection to the Maze of the Open Road. In addition to the effects of a wayfinder (Core Rulebook 617), a homeward wayfinder attunes itself to the most recent Pathfinder Lodge you've visited and has the following activation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [⏲](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency")

You teleport back to the attuned Pathfinder Lodge, as long as you are no more than 100 miles away. This [teleportation](../../../rules/traits/teleportation.md) effect fails if you would bring another creature with you, even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional space.
