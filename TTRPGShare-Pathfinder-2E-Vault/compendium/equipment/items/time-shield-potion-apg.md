This purple potion has a bitter taste and seems to blur with motion. When you drink a time shield potion, you are frozen in time for `2d4` rounds. You can't act or be targeted, you become immune to all effects, and you vanish from your space; as far as the universe is concerned, you simply don't exist as long as the potion lasts. The durations of [any](../../../rules/traits/any-b1.md) effects targeting you when you drink the potion are suspended until it wears off.

Once the potion's duration expires, you return to the normal flow of time and your former space; if that space is now occupied, you get shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.

Effects with durations immediately resume affecting you, elapsing as though no time has passed. If you are within the area of an effect created while you were outside of time, you immediately take those effects upon returning. The GM might determine that other changes that occurred while you were outside of time (such as the ground beneath you crumbling) also affect you upon your return.

Permanent Magic Items and Runes These peculiar or awe-inspiring magic items might be the spoils of bold adventures or the creations of diligent research and toil in a crafter's workshop. As permanent items, they can be used repeatedly over an adventurer's career. You can find these permanent items organized by level and subcategory on the treasure tables on pages 250–251.

Full rules for special types of items, such as staves and wands, are in the Core Rulebook, and the page numbers where they appear can be found in the glossary and index, starting on page 266 of this book.
