# Cloak Of Immolation *Item 7*  
[cursed](../../../rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [invested](../../../rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** worn cloak; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

Appearing as a magic cloak such as a cloak of elvenkind, this garment is made of highly volatile fabric. While wearing it, if you take fire damage, you also take `1d10` [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). Taking fire damage while the [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is in effect has no additional effect. You can extinguish the [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as normal.

Any creature that hits you with a melee unarmed attack while you are taking this [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) takes fire damage equal to the [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you took on your previous turn. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.
