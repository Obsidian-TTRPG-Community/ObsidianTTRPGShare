The night sky seems contained in this glass projectile.

When an activated dreaming round damages a creature, it induces drowsiness. The creature must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
> - **Success** The creature becomes [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) and [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature becomes [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) and [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed), and must attempt another Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns. If it fails, its [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition increases by 1. A successful save reduces the [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition by 1. If the [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition is removed or reduced to 0, the effect and the [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) condition end. If the target's actions are reduced to 0 by this effect, it immediately falls into a deep sleep and is [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), during which it no longer attempts a save at the end of its turn. It wakes up automatically after 1 hour or if it takes damage, but not due to non-painful stimuli (such as noise or being nudged). When it wakes up, its [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition decreases by 1, though it must once again save at the end of each of its turns and might risk falling asleep again.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is initially [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed).
