After you drink this mutagen, your skin continually renews itself, thickening into large, scaly patches.

Benefit For 1 minute, you gain fast healing 2 and automatically succeed at flat checks to recover from [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

Drawback Your thickened skin makes quick movement difficult, and your excess skin flakes off with the slightest movement.

You take a –2 penalty to Reflex saves for 1 minute. Any creature attempting to [Track](../../../rules/actions/track.md) you in the next 24 hours gains a +4 circumstance bonus to their check.
