# Codebreaker's Parchment *Item 3+*  
[illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Held

This finely crafted, seemingly mundane parchment is useful for writing sensitive documents. When words are written on this parchment, they instantly scramble into unrecognizable script, requiring a DC 20 check to [Decipher Writing](../../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The scrambled words align into the originally written script. Identifying the parchment reveals that it can be activated with a command, but a critical success to [Identify Magic](../../../rules/actions/identify-magic.md) is needed to learn the command word.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You light the parchment on fire, burning the words off while leaving the parchment unharmed and ready to bear more text.
