Swirling sand carries a faint trace of strange compulsions from the helical sand spire near Beachcomber. Adding this catalyst to a [suggestion](../../spells/suggestion.md) spell implants a strange compulsion in one target of the spell. The target creature must spin counterclockwise at the end of its turn if it didn't take a move action that turn. This spin is a free action that has the [move](../../../rules/traits/move.md) trait. This effect lasts for 3 rounds on a success, failure, or critical failure against suggestion (even if the target completes its suggestion in fewer rounds); a target that critically succeeds against suggestion is unaffected by the swirling sand.
