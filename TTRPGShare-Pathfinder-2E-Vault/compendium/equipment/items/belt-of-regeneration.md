This belt is crafted from rubbery troll hide that's green and orange in color. You gain 15 temporary Hit Points the first time you invest the belt in a day. When you invest the belt, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

You tighten the belt one notch to gain a regeneration effect. For `2d4` rounds, at the start of your turn each round, you recover 15 Hit Points unless you took acid or fire damage since the start of your previous turn.
