You become trained in your choice of [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) and in [Dueling Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

Whenever your proficiency rank in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you also gain that new proficiency rank with [Aldori dueling swords](../../../compendium/equipment/items/aldori-dueling-sword-lowg.md). You gain access to [Aldori dueling swords](../../../compendium/equipment/items/aldori-dueling-sword-lowg.md).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Aldori duelist archetype.
