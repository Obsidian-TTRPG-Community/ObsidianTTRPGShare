# Gladiator *Dedication Level 2*  

The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat drive you to become the best—and the fame isn't bad either.

If there are sapient creatures observing a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither engaged in the combat themselves nor allied or affiliated with either side, the combatants have spectators. The GM is the final arbiter.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Impressive Performance](../../../compendium/feats/impressive-performance.md)

You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment. You become trained in [Gladiatorial Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore); if already trained in [Gladiatorial Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), you instead become trained in another [Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill of your choice.

At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators, you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character level for 1 minute and you can roll [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) for your initiative.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the gladiator archetype.

On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

- A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
