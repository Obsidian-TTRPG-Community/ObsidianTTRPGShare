# Scout *Dedication Level 2*  

You're an expert in espionage and reconnaissance, able to skulk silently through the wilderness to gather intelligence, sneak through enemy lines to report to your comrades, or suddenly and decisively strike your foes. Your skills ease the difficulty of travel for you and your companions and keep you all on guard when you're approaching danger.

# Scout Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and [Survival](../../../compendium/skills.md#Survival)

You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the [Scout's Warning (ranger)](../../../compendium/feats/scouts-warning-ranger.md) ranger feat. When you're using the [Scout](../../../rules/actions/scout.md) exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scout archetype.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [flourish](../../../rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scout Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/scout-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md), [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md) against that opponent, and then make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against that foe. For your [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md), you can attempt a [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check instead of the [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) check that's usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.

If you [Avoid Notice](../../../rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) while exploring and any allies use [Follow the Expert](../../../rules/actions/follow-the-expert.md) to follow you as you do so, you can choose one of those allies to gain the benefit of any one Terrain Stalker feat you have.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scout Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/scout-dedication-apg.md)

- **Activity** Two-Action

You leap from the shadows to strike your foes. [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, then [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) twice. If you were [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [unnoticed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) by the target of these [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), your foe is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against both attacks. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally for both attacks.
