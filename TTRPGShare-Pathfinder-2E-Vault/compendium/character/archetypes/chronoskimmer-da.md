# Chronoskimmer *Dedication Level 2*  

The flow of time is an unstoppable force. Most are carried downstream inexorably, like a leaf floating on a river. You, however, somehow fell out of the flow of time, if only for an instant, but in doing so gained a perspective that few others have.

Now you stand on the banks of the river, watching the flow, choosing where to dive in, or even defying the current, at least for a short while, as you skim its surface and skip from moment to moment. As a chronoskimmer, time is yours to exploit.

You have the means to see the timelines of all creatures, including your own. You can use this insight to manipulate the flow of time for creatures, much like you can pluck the leaf from the river and place it elsewhere. Manipulating timelines can be dangerous, however, and the Dimension of Time won't allow these transgressions against time to stand forever. The threat always looms of time dimensionals coming to correct your actions or of you becoming removed from time forever.

# Chronoskimmer Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  


You became partially unstuck from time and have learned how to manipulate your place in flow of time. When you roll initiative, you can choose one of three options: either do nothing and roll initiative normally, stabilize your timestream, or destabilize your timestream and send it into intense fluctuations. If you choose to stabilize your timestream, you don't roll initiative, and instead your initiative is equal to 10 + your initiative modifier. If you choose to destabilize your timestream, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a success, your initiative is equal to 19 + your initiative modifier, and on a failure, your initiative is equal to 1 + your initiative modifier.

Both stabilizing and destabilizing your timestream are [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effects.

Additionally, if your initiative roll result is tied with an opponent's initiative roll, you go first. Your manipulation of time grants you access to a number of abilities, some of which require a saving throw. The DC for these abilities is either your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, and is called your chronoskimmer DC.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the chronoskimmer archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You fail a skill check or saving throw.
- **Activity** Reaction

After failing a test of skill, you hop back in your personal timeline so you can try again. You reroll the triggering check with a +1 circumstance bonus as you apply your experience from your last attempt. You must use the new result, even if it's worse than your first roll.

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You know the result you want and subtly nudge the timeline to your intended destination. Choose an ally or a foe. If you choose an ally, the next time within the next round that ally makes an attack roll or skill check, they roll it twice and take the higher result; this is a [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect. If you choose a foe, the next time within the next round that foe makes an attack roll or skill check, they must roll twice and take the lower result unless they succeed at a Will save against your chronoskimmer DC; this is a [misfortune](../../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect. Regardless of your choice, the target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.

- **Activity** Two-Action

You dive into the fray before rewinding yourself to safety. [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against that enemy. You then teleport back to the square from which you began your Reversing Charge. You can use Reversing Charge while [Burrowing](../../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Single Action

You call alternate versions of yourself, either from a different timeline or perhaps yourself from a different point in your current timeline, to aid you in combat. Until the start of your next turn, these alternate selves flicker in and out in your vicinity, providing flanking for you against all enemies within your reach. Flanking with your time duplicates is the same as flanking with an ally and so is subject to effects like all-around vision or the deny advantage class feature.

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You reach ahead and make use of time that's yet to be. You become [quickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) and can use the extra action to [Step](../../../rules/actions/step.md), [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md), or [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). You gain this extra action immediately and can use it this turn. At the end of your turn, you become [stunned](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

You reach into another creature's timeline and attempt to alter their flow of time. Select a creature within 30 feet. That creature attempts a Fortitude saving throw against your chronoskimmer DC. The creature takes the effects of [slow](../../../compendium/spells/slow.md) based on the result of its saving throw.

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)

By narrowing your sense of the future, you can improve that of your allies. When you roll initiative, instead of stabilizing or destabilizing your own timestream, you can grant your allies a flash of insight into their future. Choose two allies. Those allies roll their initiative roll twice and take the better result; this is a [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect. You roll your initiative roll twice and take the worse result; this is a [misfortune](../../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect. The two effects are tied together: if you would avoid the [misfortune](../../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect for any reason, or if any of your allies would negate their [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect, your Combat Premonition does nothing.

- **Frequency**: once per day

- **Activity** Free Action

You step outside of the flow of time momentarily, allowing you to avoid dangers. Your physical form stops existing momentarily, and you can't be targeted or affected until the start of your next turn— you simply don't exist at that moment in time. Your turn ends immediately, advancing 1 round for all timed durations and effects, such as conditions and afflictions. You still attempt saving throws, flat checks, or any other checks at the end of your turn as normal, but you don't take any damage due to these checks (though you take any non-damaging effects as normal). At the start of your next turn, you reenter the flow of time and reappear in the same space where you left time last round. If the space isn't clear, you arrive in the nearest open space.

You travel just a few moments into the future to immediately arrive at your destination.

Your augmented [Strides](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) have the teleport trait and don't trigger reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square.

You manipulate time to recharge one of your temporal techniques—by revising your past so you never used it in the first place.
