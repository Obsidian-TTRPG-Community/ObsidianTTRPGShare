# Marshal *Dedication Level 2*  

Marshals are leaders, first and foremost. Marshals can come from any class or background, though they all share a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for the greater good of the team. Some marshals lead from the front, sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions and encouragements from the rear while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals' ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group.

# Marshal Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in martial weapons and either [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)

You've combined your social skills and combat training to become a talented combat leader. Choose [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation). You become trained in that skill or become an expert if you were already trained in it.

In addition, you're surrounded by a marshal's aura in a 10-foot emanation. Your aura has the [emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md), [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md), and [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md) traits and grants you and allies within the aura a +1 status bonus to saving throws against [fear](../../../rules/traits/fear.md).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the marshal archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/marshal-dedication-apg.md), trained in [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Single Action

Putting on a grim face for the battle ahead, you encourage your allies to strike fear into their foes with vicious attacks.

When you use this action, attempt an [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances.

The effect depends on the result of your check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your marshal's aura increases to a 20-foot emanation, and it grants you and allies a status bonus to damage rolls equal to the number of weapon damage dice of the unarmed attack or weapon you are wielding that has the most weapon damage dice. When you or an ally in the aura critically hits an enemy with a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), that enemy is [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Success** As critical success, but your aura's size doesn't increase.
> - **Failure** You fail to enter the stance.
> - **Critical Failure** You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.

You become a brilliant example of dedication and poise in battle, encouraging your allies to follow suit. When you spend this action, attempt a [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/marshal-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You give a quick shout, hoping to shake the fog clouding your ally's thoughts. Choose one target ally within your marshal's aura who is affected by a [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect that allowed a Will save and has a duration of no longer than 1 minute. That ally can immediately attempt a Will save with a +1 circumstance bonus against the effect's DC, ending the effect on a success. This can't end the effect for any creatures other than your target ally. Regardless of the result of the save, your ally is temporarily immune to Snap Out of It! for 10 minutes.

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/marshal-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

You call out a quick cadence, guiding your allies into a more efficient rhythm. Each willing ally within your marshal's aura is [quickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) until the end of their next turn, and they can use the extra action only to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md). At the end of each ally's turn, if they used the extra action, they then become [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of their following turn.

Your fearless charge into battle reinvigorates your allies to carry on the fight. You [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed and make a melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). If your [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit gains temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier. These temporary Hit Points last until the start of your next turn.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Attack Of Opportunity (Barbarian)](../../../compendium/feats/attack-of-opportunity-barbarian.md) is intended for use with the Marshal Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity** Reaction

You swat a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

You excel at watching your allies' backs and helping them watch yours. As long as you and an ally are adjacent to each other, neither of you can become [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) due to flanking unless both of you are flanked. If you're adjacent to more than one ally, all eligible allies can benefit at a given time. The benefit is negated for everyone if at least you and any one eligible ally are flanked, but not if your allies are flanked and you aren't.

With a resounding cry, you rally your ally to the offensive. Choose one ally within your marshal's aura who has a reaction available. If you spend 1 action, that ally can use their reaction to immediately [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md). If you spend 2 actions, that ally can use their reaction to immediately [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

If your [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit can use a reaction to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md), but they each must end their [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) closer to the creature you hit than where they started.

Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively. When you grant allies the [quickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition using Cadence Call, they can use the extra action to either [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), and they aren't [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) on their following turn if they use the extra action.
