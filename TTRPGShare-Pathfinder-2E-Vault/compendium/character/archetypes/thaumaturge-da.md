# Thaumaturge *Dedication Level 2*  

Scraps of knowledge have taught you how to exploit the vulnerabilities of creatures and the powers of mystical objects.

## Multiclass Thaumaturge Characters
<sup>DA p. 49</sup>

Thaumaturge suits characters who want to glean strange knowledge. It's especially useful for those who tend to fight with one-handed weapons, like swashbucklers or rogues, since they have their other hand free for an implement.

- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 14

You've uncovered basic thaumaturgy. You become trained in thaumaturge class DC. Choose an first implement and esoterica|thaumaturge|DA|1||implement; you can use it to Glimpse Vulnerability, but don't gain its benefits. You also gain a few esoterica, allowing you to use [esoterica](../../../rules/traits/esoterica-da.md) actions. You become trained in your choice of [Arcana](../../../compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../../../compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../../../compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../../../compendium/skills.md#Religion); if you were already trained in these, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the Glimpse Vulnerability action.
