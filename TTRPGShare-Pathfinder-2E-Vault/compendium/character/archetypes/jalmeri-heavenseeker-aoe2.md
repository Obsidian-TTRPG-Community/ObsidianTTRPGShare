# Jalmeri Heavenseeker *Dedication Level 4*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

Certain martial artists dedicate themselves to fighting in Jalmeray's Challenge of Sky and Heaven; these individuals devote themselves to the esoteric mysteries of the sky and incorporate these lofty abilities into their martial arts maneuvers. You may have learned these skills from the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray, or from a practitioner of this style who left Jalmeray bearing its secrets (such as Shristi Melipdra). The Houses of Perfection focus on honing elemental powers, but the Jalmeri heavenseeker isn't limited by the powers of air alone. This style's attacks emulate darting flashes of lightning and the crash of thunder from roiling storm clouds. A true practitioner masters control even over dense matter, causing the air to support its weight or bring it crashing down.

# Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: trained by a current or former member of a House of Perfection
- **Prerequisites**: expert in unarmed attacks

Your skill and dedication have set you on a path to master the techniques of Jalmeray's greatest martial artists: victors of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven. You become trained in either [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Occultism](../../../compendium/skills.md#Occultism). You gain either the [Ki Rush](../../../compendium/feats/ki-rush.md) or [Ki Strike](../../../compendium/feats/ki-strike.md) monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [Refocus](../../../rules/actions/refocus.md) activity as a monk does. If you already have both these feats, you can instead choose a single 1st-level monk feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Jalmeri heavenseeker archetype.

# Heaven's Thunder  [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [electricity](../../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [sonic](../../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  verbal  

- **Prerequisites**: [Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/jalmeri-heavenseeker-dedication-aoe2.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

With a loud shout, you unleash your ki in a crackling shroud of thunder and lightning that engulfs your body.

Until the end of your next turn, your unarmed attacks and weapons you wield that have the [monk](../../../rules/traits/monk.md) trait deal additional electricity damage equal to one-half your level and additional sonic damage equal to one-half your level.

If you also know the [ki blast](../../../compendium/spells/ki-blast.md) ki spell, you can choose to deal either electricity or sonic damage with the spell instead of force while this effect is active (ki blast loses the [force](../../../rules/traits/force.md) trait and gains the [electricity](../../../rules/traits/electricity.md) or [sonic](../../../rules/traits/sonic.md) trait instead). Any creature who successfully Grapples you or is successfully Grappled by you also takes this damage immediately after the [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md) check is resolved.

- **Prerequisites**: [Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/jalmeri-heavenseeker-dedication-aoe2.md)
- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a stance perfected by past champions of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven, allowing you to make jagged strikes like flashes of lightning through the sky. The only [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are skyward slash unarmed attacks. These unarmed attacks deal `1d10` slashing damage; are in the brawling; and have the [nonlethal](../../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [unarmed](../../../rules/traits/unarmed.md), and [versatile <P>](../../../rules/traits/versatile.md) traits.

While in Sky and Heaven Stance, you gain resistance 2 to electricity and resistance 2 to sonic damage. These resistances increase to 5 at 12th level and to 8 at 18th level.

- **Prerequisites**: [Sky and Heaven Stance](../../../compendium/feats/sky-and-heaven-stance-aoe2.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Sky and Heaven Stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You [Leap](../../../rules/actions/leap.md) toward an opponent. At any point in the Leap, you can make a single [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature within your reach. At 12th level, if you hit with this Strike, instead of finishing your Leap, you can immediately attempt a second Leap from the space where you struck the target of your Strike. You can make a single Strike against a target within your reach during this second Leap as well. At 16th level, you can attempt a third Leap if your second Strike hits, and you can attack a target at any point during this third Leap.

All Leaps made during this activity gain a +10-foot status bonus to the total height or distance of your leap, and no two [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) can target the same creature.

- **Requirements**: You are in Sky and Heaven Stance.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed and your ki enshrouds your limbs in a terrifying stormy energy, increasing the reach of your Sky and Heaven Stance unarmed attacks by 5 feet.

At the end of your movement, make up to three [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a target you can reach, each at a –2 penalty. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after you have made all your attacks. Instead of the usual slashing or piercing damage, the damage for these [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) is either electricity or sonic, as you choose with each [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you successfully hit with all three [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), the target is [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained).
