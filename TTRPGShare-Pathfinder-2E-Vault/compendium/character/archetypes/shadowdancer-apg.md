# Shadowdancer *Dedication Level 8*  

Shadow has always been the cousin of fear. Within the darkness, monsters dwell, plans are hatched, and enemies strike with fang and dagger and dark magic. But some embrace the shadow, gain power from it, and dance within its shifting dark.

A true shadowdancer is a creature who flits on the edge of light and darkness. Moving amid the inky blackness, shadowdancers are spies, assassins, infiltrators, and emissaries. Some shadowdancers use their relationship with the dark for good, while others embrace the primordial night, its terror, and its betrayal.

Regardless of the reason why someone embraces the shadows, the shadows embrace that person in turn, gradually transforming them into something inky, nebulous, and mysterious.

> [!pf2-brown] CALL OF SHADOWS
> 
> The shadows call out to a potential shadowdancer in a myriad of ways. Often it starts with fear—fear of the dark, fear of enemies, or an underlying uncontrolled anxiety and the desire to gain power over the darkness. Many potential shadowdancers hear the shadows whisper in their heads. First dismissed as some perverse trick of the mind, the whispers can seem to ebb and wane, but a true calling becomes more lucid and more compelling.
> 
> In some shadow-infused lands in the Pathfinder setting, particularly Nidal, Ustalav, and even Cheliax, organizations search for and recruit those called by the shadows, eager to transform them into spies and assassins. But the call can come to any creature anywhere. It's just a question of whether the creature heeds the call and forms a pact with the shadows.
> 
> Though it is hard to convince many folks otherwise, given the fearsome reputations of shadowdancers working for dark powers and cabals, there is nothing intrinsically evil about embracing the shadows. Darkness is amoral but not without its champions for good and even law, though it is true that such shadowdancers are few and far between.

You gain the ability to fuse and play with shadows by using focus spells specific to shadowdancers.

- **Activity** Single Action

Leaping out from hiding, you assail your target when they least expect it. You [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, but you must end your movement next to an enemy you're [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](../../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by. You then [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) that enemy; you remain [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](../../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by that creature until after you [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). You can use Spring from the Shadows while [Burrowing](../../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

- **Activity** Reaction

When you look for foes, you catch the slightest of cues.

- **Trigger** Your turn ends.
- **Requirements**: You are currently affected by a [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect that you gained by failing, but not critically failing, a saving throw.
- **Activity** Reaction

You can find a loophole in a [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect to temporarily overcome it. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect that meets the requirement. You can suppress a particular effect using Cognitive Loophole only once.

**Special.** You can use this reaction even if the [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect is preventing you from using reactions.

The shadows protect you better than any armor can, and they give you power to plunge others into darkness. Whenever you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you gain resistance 5 to all damage except force and damage from [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the [ghost touch](../../../compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) property rune. When you attempt a Reflex saving throw in an area of dim light or darkness, you can roll twice and take the higher result; this is a [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect.
