# Swordmaster *Dedication Level 6*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

Though the ultimate goal of the Pathfinder society is to learn, knowledge cannot be spread if those who discover it fail to come back alive. The Master of Swords teaches recruits to survive, to defend other Pathfinders, and to defeat the Society's enemies. The swordmaster embodies these skills, focusing on practicality and ignoring ideals or methods that interfere with their ability to overcome any challenge.

# Swordmaster Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution 14; member of the Pathfinder Society affiliated with the School of Swords

Your Swords training taught you to never lose hold of your weapon. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when foes attempt to [Disarm](../../../rules/actions/disarm.md) you. If you have the [Deft Cooperation](../../../compendium/feats/deft-cooperation-lowg.md) feat and critically succeed on a check to [Aid](../../../rules/actions/aid.md) an ally's attack roll or skill check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus from Deft Cooperation (instead of a +1 bonus) the first time you attempt an attack roll or attempt a skill check where the bonus would apply.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Swordmaster archetype.

# Shoulder Catastrophe  [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Shoulder Catastrophe](../../../compendium/feats/shoulder-catastrophe-locg.md) is intended for use with the Swordmaster Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/swordmaster-dedication-locg.md)
- **Trigger** An enemy critically succeeds at a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against an adjacent ally.
- **Activity** Reaction

You've trained to protect your allies by diverting the worst attacks to yourself. The enemy doesn't double the damage from the triggering [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) but instead applies the normal damage to both you and your ally. Both of you take any effects that would happen on a hit that dealt damage, such as poison, but neither of you are subject to any effects that would happen only on a critical success.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Death's Door](../../../compendium/feats/deaths-door-locg.md) is intended for use with the Swordmaster Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/swordmaster-dedication-locg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** You take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.
- **Activity** Reaction

You continue to fight when others would fall. Just before taking the triggering damage, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to twice your level. If you have Hit Points remaining after gaining these temporary Hit Points, you aren't knocked [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), nor do you suffer the other effects of being reduced to 0 Hit Points. Any temporary Hit Points that remain after applying the damage last for up to 4 rounds.
