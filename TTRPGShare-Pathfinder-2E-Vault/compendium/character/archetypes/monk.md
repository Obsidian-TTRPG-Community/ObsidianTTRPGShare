# Monk *Dedication Level 2*  

Monastic training has taught you martial arts and allowed you to hone your mind, body, and spirit to new heights.

## Multiclass Monk characters
<sup>CRB p. 227</sup>

The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character that fights unarmored or with unarmed attacks.

- Barbarian monks with the animal instinct can combine the barbarian's excellent unarmed damage with the monk's diverse unarmed special abilities.
- Champion monks are perfect for champions of Irori or other deities who favor unarmed attacks.
- Fighter monks can supplement free-hand fighting and add mobility to the fighter's toolkit.
- Rogue monks are incredibly effective because stances grant some of the best agile finesse attacks and flurry gives more sneak attacks.
- Spellcaster monks can fight with a free hand and still use material components to cast spells.
