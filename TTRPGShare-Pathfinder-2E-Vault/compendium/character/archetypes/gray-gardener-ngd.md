# Gray Gardener *Dedication Level 2*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

The Gray Gardeners are the remorseless executioners of Galt. Prior to the events of the adventure, the Gray Gardeners are at best sinister (when not actively pursuing evil) as a malevolent monster controls their organization. After the events of Night of the Gray Death, the organization is broken—leadership is in disarray while the rank-and-file members labor to enforce laws and recapture escaped criminals. The Gray Gardeners still command the respect of Galt's people, however, as their brutal reputation is indelibly etched in the public consciousness over the last fifty years.

The following is suitable for heroes to take after the events of Night of the Gray Death. You might be a member of the old organization who tried to uphold order despite vindictive directives from above, or you might be someone who recently donned a mask to enforce the law in Galt's new age. Either way, as a Gray Gardener you draw power and authority from being masked and have a reputation for dispassionate justice.

Your vigilante identity is that of a Gray Gardener, and you must be wearing a mask to use any of your vigilante feats or you risk exposing your social identity, as described in the [vigilante](vigilante-apg.md) archetype.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [vigilante](../../../rules/traits/vigilante-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vigilante Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md), member of the Gray Gardeners
- **Activity** Single Action

Choose one creature you can see, and loudly declare the creature's life forfeit by your judgment. That creature becomes your condemned foe until they are defeated, you use Harsh Judgment on a different creature, or the encounter ends. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) your condemned foe and on [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) them. You have a –1 circumstance penalty to [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) creatures other than your condemned foe and on [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) anyone other than your condemned foe.

You typically can use Harsh Judgment only during an encounter, and if you try to use it to declare someone's life forfeit during exploration or downtime, you are likely to start an encounter.

You easily command the attention of others, and when the time comes to turn threats into action, your authoritative voice causes foes to falter.

Your voice be heard easily by any creatures within 300 feet if you wish, regardless of the level of ambient noise, although your voice can't penetrate silence or similar effect. If you roll [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) for initiative, on the first round of combat, creatures that haven't acted yet are [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you.

If you use [Sense Motive](../../../rules/actions/sense-motive.md) on a creature you have currently condemned with Harsh Judgment, your GM rolls the [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) check twice and takes the higher result (this is a [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect).

If you're in your vigilante identity, you can command the target only to approach you, drop [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), or stand in place. If you're in your social identity, you can command the target only to run away or release what the target is holding.

You swing wide, attempting to behead your condemned foe. Make a melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against your condemned foe. If you hit, your condemned foe takes `8d6` extra precision damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the condemned foe is reduced to 0 Hit Points by the execution and requires a head to live, they die. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Execution for 1 day.
