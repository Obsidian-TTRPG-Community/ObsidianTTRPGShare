# Alkenstar Agent Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You have been initiated by the grand duchess of Alkenstar or one of her agents.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) and at least one firearm

You put on the persona of a rough and tumble outlaw, but your real goals are to report threats to Alkenstar back to the grand duchess. You become an expert in [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) and trained in your choice of [Underworld Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Legal Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain the [Lie to Me](../../../compendium/feats/lie-to-me.md) skill feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the Alkenstar Agent archetype.

Your unpredictable gunfire often catches enemies off guard or hits unprotected areas. Make a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a firearm against a creature that you haven't already attacked on this turn. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage on this [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) equal to the number of weapon damage dice. The [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) gains the following failure effect.

If you have the ruffian racket, you can do this as a free action when you successfully [Shove](../../../rules/actions/shove.md) a target.

You keep pace with a retreating foe. You [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md), but you must end your movement adjacent to the triggering enemy. Your move does not trigger reactions from the triggering enemy. You can use Reactive Pursuit to [Burrow](../../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](../../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

- **Prerequisites**: Alkenstar Agent Dedication, master in [Society](../../../compendium/skills.md#Society)

You're practiced at creating forgeries that establish your outlaw credentials or augment your legal authority. You can [Create a Forgery](../../../rules/actions/create-forgery.md) as an exploration activity. It takes you about 1 hour per page of the document that you're forging. This time is reduced to 10 minutes per page if you're legendary in [Society](../../../compendium/skills.md#Society).

- **Prerequisites**: Alkenstar Agent Dedication, master in [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a fearsome show of your authority. Roll [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) each creature in a 30-foot cone. When you do so, [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) gains the [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md) trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. If a target creature hasn't broken a law in the past week (as determined by the GM), the result of your check against that creature is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled.

You've learned to react with ranged weapons when a creature is in close quarters. You can use a reaction that normally allows you to make a melee weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) to instead make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). You must be Striking an adjacent target. If necessary for the reaction's trigger, you treat your ranged weapon as if it had a reach of 5 feet. If the reaction has other requirements, such as wielding a specific kind of weapon, Snap Shot doesn't allow you to ignore them; it allows you only to replace a melee weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

You distract your opponent with a few choice words or a rude gesture. Choose a target within 30 feet. It's [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your attacks until the end of your next turn. Depending on the way you describe your distraction, this action gains either the [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md) trait.
