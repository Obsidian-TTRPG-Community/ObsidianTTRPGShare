# Champion *Dedication Level 2*  

You have sworn a solemn oath to your deity, who has granted you champion powers to aid you in your cause.

## Multiclass Champion characters
<sup>CRB p. 223</sup>

The champion archetype greatly improves defenses, particularly armor. It's a great way for a character to gain armor proficiency or a powerful defensive reaction.
