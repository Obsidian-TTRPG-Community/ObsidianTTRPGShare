# Firework Technician *Dedication Level 2*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

The brilliant display of cascading lights and flickering aerial flowers, the thunderous boom, the sizzling crackle, and piercing screech—these are the stock and trade of your craft. You know how to perfectly pair light and sound to create fireworks displays that can amaze children and adults, comfort friends, and even confound your foes.

As a fireworks technician, you might be an itinerant wanderer, roaming from town to town and developing your craft on your own. In that case, you make a living on the road, selling fireworks to the townsfolk, setting up public displays upon request and receipt of payment, and even tailoring individualized performances to those wealthy or interesting enough to be worthy of receiving their own private show.

On the other hand, you might be part of an established fireworks house from Tian Xia or Vudra and rely on teamwork to perfect your various formulas and displays. Hoping to produce the next great innovation in fireworks technology, you often send back the notes from your studies and field demonstrations to esteemed colleagues from your fireworks house, seeking their opinions on your next big idea.

> [!pf2-example] Describing your Fireworks Display
> 
> As a firework technician, the exact visuals of your character's special abilities might matter significantly to you. No two firework technicians use exactly the same fireworks display, even if they come from the same fireworks house and both use the same feat to generate the display. In fact, it's likely that when you use a feat from the firework technician archetype, the resulting display remains a bit different each time as you tinker, perfect, and refine your technique. Even so, you probably have a few themes that you prefer for each of your firework technician feats. For instance, your Coughing Dragon Display might appear in the sinuous serpentine shape of a literal imperial dragon, coughing out glittering trails. It might also resemble a simple series of geometric shapes, an enigmatic spiraling aeon trailing off in a shape with radial symmetry, a pattern shaped like a tree blossoming with flowers in the sky, or anything else you can imagine. To help your fellow players visualize what your character is doing, you might come up with some go-to descriptions or draw art depicting some of your favorite displays.

# Firework Technician Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](../../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You've learned the secrets of making fire and sound bloom using black powder, metals, and paper. You most likely came by this knowledge through formal training with a fireworks house in Tian Xia or a fireworks company from Vudra, though perhaps you mastered fireworks completely by yourself after finding a secret stash in an old shipwreck.

You become trained in [Fireworks Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) or become an expert if you were already trained in it. You gain the [Alchemical Crafting](../../../compendium/feats/alchemical-crafting.md) feat, a pool of infused reagents equal to your level, and advanced alchemy|alchemist||1| (allowing you to make alchemical items during your daily preparations without the normal cost or time expenditure). You can use your infused reagents only to make fireworks, Launch a Fireworks Display, and use other feats from this archetype (see below). Your advanced alchemy level is 1. If you gain infused reagents from more than one source, you use the highest number of reagents to determine your pool rather than adding them together.

You can also create special fireworks displays using your infused reagents, designed to create distinctive effects you can use to make onlookers marvel and even to gain an advantage in combat. You gain the Launch Fireworks Display action and learn some basic displays, and you can learn additional, more complex displays through other firework technician feats. The DC for any display is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Launch Fireworks Display [V](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies")
[manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Cost**: 1 or more batches of infused reagents
- **Requirements**: You have a free hand

**Effect** You set off a fireworks display. You can launch a normal firework to simply create a visual or audible signal within 20 feet or you can choose one of the following special effects. A firework display has the listed traits, and if it costs more than 1 batch of infused reagents, it is noted in its Cost entry.

- **Comet** [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)) You shoot a streak of shining light in a 60-foot line. All spaces in that line are lit with bright light until the start of your next turn. As part of this action, you can also [Point Out](../../../rules/actions/point-out.md) a single creature in the line, and your allies do not need to hear or understand you.
- **Flower** [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)) You ignite a ring of sparks, creating a shape that might be reminiscent of a flower blooming in the sky. Each enemy with 20 feet of you must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the enemy is [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round, and on a critical failure they are [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 2 rounds.
- **Salute** [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md)) You create a startling bang or whistle, adding an [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) component to your fireworks display. When you launch a salute display, you can choose a [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) or [fascinated](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) ally within 60 feet. If the ally you chose is [fascinated](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), the noise is so violent that it acts as a [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) effect for the purpose of their [fascinated](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) condition (though it has no negative repercussions) automatically ending most applications of the [fascinated](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) condition. If they're [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused), the sound is so loud and violent that it might snap the ally out of confusion. They can immediately attempt the flat check to remove the [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) condition which normally occurs when a creature is damaged. If the [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) condition has special rules that remove the flat check when taking damage or make the flat check harder, those rules also apply to the salute.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the fireworks technician archetype.

# Coughing Dragon Display  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Firework Technician Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/firework-technician-dedication-g-g.md)

This display emits a cascade of loud bangs or glittering trails. While you initially designed the display to captivate your audience's attention, it turns out to have a surprisingly effective use in combat, suppressing [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md) effects behind your magnificent display. You gain the Coughing Dragon fireworks display.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Coughing Dragon [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

- **Cost**: 2 batches of infused reagents

Choose either [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md) effects. The display gains that trait, and you attempt to counteract one or more effects within 60 feet that have this trait. On a success, the effect is suppressed until the start of your next turn, rather than ending entirely. Use your [Fireworks Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) modifier as your counteract modifier, and your counteract level is equal to half your advanced alchemy level (rounded up). A coughing dragon costs 2 batches of infused reagents rather than 1, but you can increase the cost to 3 batches and spend an additional action to create an even bigger coughing dragon display that attempts to counteract both [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md) and [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md) effects at the same time.

- **Prerequisites**: [Firework Technician Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/firework-technician-dedication-g-g.md)

This multi-sequence rocket blasts confetti at a series of altitudes. While the design is intended to delight children of all ages, you've found it has an unexpected side effect of confounding enemy fliers. You gain the Jumping Jenny fireworks display.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Jumping Jenny [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Cost**: 2 batches of infused reagents

Target a flying creature within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, each time that creature attempts to [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md), they must succeed at an [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Maneuver in Flight](../../../rules/actions/maneuver-in-flight.md) against the DC of your fireworks display, or the [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md) action is disrupted. If all the creature's attempts to [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md) are disrupted, at the end of its turn, it falls harmlessly to the ground below. A jumping jenny costs 2 batches of infused reagents, rather than 1.

Flames and explosions sear the air in a riot of color and devastation that rivals that wrought by even the wildest goblin party. The display is both so beautiful and chaotic that, while mesmerizing, it poses a significant risk to the physical health, sight, and hearing of anyone who gets too close. You gain the Goblin Jubilee fireworks display.

Chaos fills a 20-foot burst within 120 feet. All creatures in the area takes `3d6` fire damage and `3d6` sonic damage and must attempt a Fortitude save.

A goblin jubilee display costs 3 batches of infused reagents, rather than 1.
