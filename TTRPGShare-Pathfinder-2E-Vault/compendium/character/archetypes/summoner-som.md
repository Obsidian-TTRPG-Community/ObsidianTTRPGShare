# Summoner *Dedication Level 2*  

You have a tenuous connection to an eidolon, a bodiless being that shares your life force, and with effort you can manifest the eidolon into the world.

## Multiclass Summoner Characters
<sup>SoM p. 76</sup>

The summoner archetype grants you an eidolon to join you in battle. It's a particularly helpful multiclass for characters with weaker martial abilities.

- Alchemist summoners can use their eidolons as lab assistants or even as the source of experiments. They are a good fit for construct or plant eidolons.
- Barbarian summoners find themselves drawn to the fury of anger phantoms, the two fueled by the same inner instinct.
- Bard summoners inspire their eidolons to greater heights with their bardic performances. They often team up with eidolons who pair well with their muse, such as a fey eidolon for a polymath muse or a phantom eidolon for a warrior muse.
- Champion summoners get along best with divine eidolons matching the alignment associated with their cause—angel eidolons for the tenets of good, devil eidolons for a tyrant, and so on. This allows the champion and eidolon to have a unity in philosophy and purpose that other eidolon choices might lack.
- Cleric summoners often find a connection to eidolons associated with their deity, such as a [Sarenite](../../setting/deities/sarenrae.md) cleric who chooses an angel eidolon. Clerics' ability to heal and support allows them to keep their eidolon healthy.
- Druid summoners find the life link with primal eidolons to be a religious experience. They are especially likely to bond with eidolons that match their order, such as plant eidolons for the leaf order or beast eidolons for the animal or wild order.
- Fighter summoners use tactics and techniques with their eidolons to best foes. They can partner with eidolons of any kind, but they work especially well with eidolons who provide utilities that complement their fighting style.
- Monk summoners often choose eidolons that are on their own path to enlightenment, to help enrich the monk's journey. These might be divine eidolons, especially if the monk is religious or uses divine ki spells, but they also might be phantoms seeking to transcend their phantom existence to reach the afterlife.
- Ranger summoners get along best with beast and plant eidolons, but they make a good team with other eidolons as well, especially when an archer ranger teams up with a melee eidolon.
- Rogue summoners gain a partner in crime that can disappear when necessary, providing the eidolon with the ultimate getaway as long as no one expects it to carry back loot from a heist. Rogues work well with tricky eidolons, such as fey, and they get a lot of mileage out of sharing their skills with their eidolon. The Unfetter Eidolon feat can be especially useful if the rogue wants to establish a quick alibi far from the eidolon's crimes.
- Sorcerer summoners often choose eidolons that match closely to their bloodline, such as a psychopomp eidolon for the psychopomp bloodline. The eidolon might even be part of the story of how the sorcerer gained their bloodline.
- Wizard summoners are especially appreciative of an eidolon to help them in combat, and they tend to favor arcane eidolons like dragon and construct eidolons.

# Summoner Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [multiclass](../../../rules/traits/multiclass.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 14

You've formed a bond with an eidolon, an entity that manifests in a physical body only through its link to your life force. Your bond may be tenuous, but that doesn't make your connection any less special. You gain an eidolon as well as the [Manifest Eidolon](../../../rules/actions/manifest-eidolon-som.md) activity.

Due to your tenuous link, you can't gain or use [tandem](../../../rules/traits/tandem-som.md) actions. Because you don't have [Act Together](../../../rules/actions/act-together-som.md), only you or your eidolon can perform an [exploration](../../../rules/traits/exploration.md) activity at one time, so for instance you couldn't both be [Searching](../../../rules/actions/search.md)} or [Investigating](../../../rules/actions/investigate.md).

Your eidolon is trained in unarmed attacks and unarmored defense, and shares your proficiency rank for [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception), saving throws, and skill checks. Choose an eidolon type. You become trained in your eidolon's listed skills. For each of those skills that you are already trained in, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.

Your eidolon's initial ability scores are reduced. It starts with a 16 in any ability score listed at 18 for its eidolon array. It otherwise gains the statistics listed for an eidolon of that type.

At 5th level, the eidolon's ability score that was reduced to 16 increases to 18, before applying ability boosts. At levels 5, 10, 15, and 20, your eidolon also gets four ability boosts, which follow the same rules as yours.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the summoner archetype.

You gain the basic bounded spellcasting benefits.

You gain the [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity. Your key spellcasting ability for summoner archetype spells is Charisma, and they are summoner spells of your eidolon's tradition.

You become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs of that tradition. You gain a spell repertoire and two cantrips. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the summoner archetype, add a spell of that level or lower to your repertoire. Each time you lose spell slots of a particular level, remove those spells from your repertoire.
