# Psychic Duelist *Dedication Level 4*  

The mental landscape of the psychic duel rises to meet your steps and reshapes at your touch. You understand the binary mindscape links two minds, making its foundation only as strong as the wills of those involved. Two psychic castles in a siege—patch every loose brick in your walls and single out every flaw in your foe's defenses.

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](../../../compendium/skills.md#Occultism), you have been in a psychic duel

Through experience and in-depth visualizations of mental battles, you've grown adept at psychic duels. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your initiative rolls for psychic duels. Each time you enter a psychic duel, choose one of the following benefits for the duration of that duel.

- Mind Mace You gain a status bonus to mental damage with spells you cast equal to the spell's level.
- Psychic Fist You can use your standard ability modifier for [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) damage instead of your highest mental modifier, and you can use your full AC instead of using your Will DC in place of your AC.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the psychic duelist archetype.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Instigate Psychic Duel](../../../compendium/feats/instigate-psychic-duel-da.md) is intended for use with the Psychic Duelist Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Psychic Duelist Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/psychic-duelist-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Three-Action

You attempt to enter a psychic duel with a creature within 100 feet. The target can attempt a Will save against the higher of your spell DC or class DC. If it enters the duel willingly, use the result for a critical failure.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The two of you enter a psychic duel, but it ends automatically at the end of your next turn. As normal for a psychic duel, the duel ends if one participant is knocked out, as well as under any other conditions to which both participants agree. If you're in initiative when you Instigate the Psychic Duel, you keep the same initiative positions. You can each choose a psychic center for any skill in which you're trained, as you would if you were using that skill to roll initiative for the duel.
> - **Failure** As a success, except instead of ending at the end of your next turn, the target can attempt a new save to end the duel at the end of each of your turns, starting with your next turn.
> - **Critical Failure** As a success, except the duel doesn't end until it reaches one of the normal end conditions for a psychic duel.
