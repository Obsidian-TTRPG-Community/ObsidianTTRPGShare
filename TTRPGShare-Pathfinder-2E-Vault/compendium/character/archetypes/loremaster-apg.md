# Loremaster *Dedication Level 2*  

Knowledge is power, and you labor in pursuit of that power. No matter the situation, you can usually procure some tidbit of knowledge to inform your actions. You specialize in secrets, both uncovering them and hiding them away, and your command of the written word borders on the supernatural. As you discover deeper secrets of lore, you might develop a power over knowledge that becomes outright magical, allowing you to understand and disguise information even more effectively.

# Loremaster Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in at least one skill to [Decipher Writing](../../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md)

You've compiled a vast repository of information that touches on nearly every subject. You are trained in [Loremaster Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), a special [Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill that can be used only to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), but on any topic. If you have legendary proficiency in a skill used to [Decipher Writing](../../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md), you gain expert proficiency in [Loremaster Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), but you can't increase your proficiency rank in [Loremaster Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) by any other means. You can take feats in the loremaster's additional feats entry even if you don't meet the enigma muse prerequisite.

If you have the [Bardic Lore](../../../compendium/feats/bardic-lore.md) class feat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with [Bardic Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the loremaster archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: Enigma muse

You magically unlock memories, making them easier to recall. You learn the [loremaster's etude](../../../compendium/spells/loremasters-etude.md) composition spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

- **Prerequisites**: [Loremaster Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/loremaster-dedication-apg.md)

You've learned those tidbits of magic that are most conducive to furthering your acquisition and transmission of knowledge. You gain [guidance](../../../compendium/spells/guidance.md), [message](../../../compendium/spells/message.md), and [sigil](../../../compendium/spells/sigil.md) as innate occult cantrips.

You understand the principles that underlie all written words, allowing you to read nearly any text. You can attempt to [Decipher Writing](../../../rules/actions/decipher-writing.md) using [Loremaster Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) in place of the required skill.

# Quick Study  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Loremaster Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/loremaster-dedication-apg.md)

During your daily preparations, you can study a particular subject to gain the trained proficiency rank in one [Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill of your choice. You must have interacted with that subject in some way on the previous day, whether by reading about it, talking to someone knowledgeable on the topic, or experiencing it yourself. Alternatively, you can reference your notes to instead choose a [Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill you've prepared before with Quick Study. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.

- **Prerequisites**: enigma muse

You can procure information with confidence. Whenever you [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) using any skill (including [Bardic Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore)), you can forgo rolling your check to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (don't apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers). As long as you are an expert in a skill, you meet the prerequisites for the [Automatic Knowledge](../../../compendium/feats/automatic-knowledge.md) skill feat in that skill, even if you don't have [Assurance](../../../compendium/feats/assurance.md) in that skill.

As per the special clause in the Automatic Knowledge feat, you can still only use Automatic Knowledge once per round.
