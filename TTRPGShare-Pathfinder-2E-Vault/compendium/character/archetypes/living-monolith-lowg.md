# Living Monolith *Dedication Level 2*

# Living Monolith Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from the Golden Road region.
- **Prerequisites**: Ancient Osiriani and Sphinx languages, trained in [Crafting](../../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You've begun to inscribe a magical stone called a ka stone that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent ka stone. If you fail a recovery check while [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying), your [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition increases by only 1. You become trained in [Ancient Osirion Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), or expert if you were already trained.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the living monolith archetype.

# Ka Stone Ritual  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Living Monolith Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/living-monolith-dedication-lowg.md), a sphinx or living monolith with this feat performs a ritual with you

You inscribe your true name on your ka stone, as well as oaths to gods and pharaohs, and embed it in your forehead in a special ritual with a sphinx or with a living monolith who already has this feat. The ka stone is an invested magic item that you automatically invest each day. It can't be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. Its Bulk is negligible.

The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against [death](../../../rules/traits/death.md) effects and [negative](../../../rules/traits/negative.md) effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You cast [enlarge](../../../compendium/spells/enlarge.md) on yourself or use one of the other activated abilities granted by a later [Living Monolith](../../../compendium/character/archetypes/living-monolith-lowg.md) feat.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ka Stone Ritual](../../../compendium/feats/ka-stone-ritual-lowg.md)

You recover naturally from the [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition twice as quickly as normal.
