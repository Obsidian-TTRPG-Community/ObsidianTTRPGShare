# Knight Vigilant Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Religion](../../../compendium/skills.md#Religion), any good alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank

You are dedicated to the cause of the Shining Sentinels. You gain expert proficiency in [Religion](../../../compendium/skills.md#Religion). When you are between an ally and a foe and would provide lesser cover to your ally against the foe's attacks, you twist to become even more obtrusive, providing standard cover instead.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Vigilant archetype.

[fighter](../../../rules/traits/fighter.md)  

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Shield Warden (Fighter)](../../../compendium/feats/shield-warden-fighter.md) is intended for use with the Knight Vigilant Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Block](../../../compendium/feats/shield-block.md)

You use your shield to protect your allies. When you have a [shield raised](../../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), you can use your [Shield Block](../../../compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction when an attack is made against an ally adjacent to you. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of preventing you from taking damage, following the normal rules for [Shield Block](../../../compendium/feats/shield-block.md).

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Vigilant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md), expert in Will saves

Your faith and hope can't be shaken, and you won't flee when lives are at stake. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against [fear](../../../rules/traits/fear.md) effects and [emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effects that inflict despair. When you would gain the [fleeing](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) condition, you can choose to stand your ground and be [stunned](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for the effect's duration as well, preventing you from running and allowing you to re-enter the fight more quickly when the effect ends.

```ad-embed-ability

[manipulate](../../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Trigger**: An enemy casts a spell that targets you or an ally within 15 feet of you.

**Effect** You interpose your shield's ward against the spell. Attempt a counteract check, using your [Religion](../../../compendium/skills.md#Religion) modifier as your counteract modifier. On a success, the spell is counteracted and your shield takes damage equal to four times the spell level as it absorbs and disperses the magical energy. On a failure, the shield takes damage equal to twice the spell's level.
