# Pistol Phenom *Dedication Level 2*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)

You treat combat as an art and your pistol as an extension of your performance. You might wield a single pistol, a pair of pistols, or a pistol paired with a melee weapon to pull off showy maneuvers. However you slice it, though, the use of pistols or other one-handed firearms is crucial to your technique and style.

To you, everything is a show, and you use your gun as a prop and instrument, not just to kill opponents but to trick, mislead, hinder, and even bully them into doing what you want them to do. While others tend to focus on delivering as much devastation downrange as possible, your style is all about control. By controlling a foe's attention and actions, you can bolster your own attacks and mitigate the foe's potential for mayhem. You control the tempo of the battle much as you would a staged performance, carefully ensuring your foe's actions don't fall outside of your intended script. You're both the director and the star of this show, and your enemies dance to the tune you play with your pistol... sometimes quite literally!

> [!pf2-example] What makes a Phenom?
> 
> Many gunslingers can learn how to twirl a pistol or intimidate a foe, but it's not just your skills that make you a phenom, it's your style and attitude. As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it.
> 
> Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.

# Pistol Phenom Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm, trained in [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception), trained in [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance)

You catch an opponent off-guard by spinning your weapon.

You gain the [Pistol Twirl](../../../compendium/feats/pistol-twirl-g-g.md) gunslinger feat, enabling you to [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md) against creatures within your weapon's first range increment.

This otherwise serves as Pistol Twirl for the purpose of meeting prerequisites, although as normal, it doesn't count as another pistol phenom feat for the purpose of meeting Pistol Phenom Dedication's special entry and taking another archetype. Whenever you [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md) with a one-handed firearm, you can choose to attempt a [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) check instead of a [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) check.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the pistol phenom archetype.

# Gunpowder Gauntlet  [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded one-handed firearm.
- **Activity** Single Action

Your flair keeps foes' attention, as your motions with your gun draw your foes into a deadly game. As you toy with them and performatively brandish your weapon, you build their tunnel vision, leaving them trapped in a perceptual gauntlet of your own making. Attempt a [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) check against the Will DC of a single target within your one-handed firearm's first range increment.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes a –2 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.

[gunslinger](../../../rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)

You're comfortable wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand and a melee weapon in the other, combining melee attacks with shots from the firearm. When you make a successful ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy within your reach with your one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow, that enemy is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your next melee attack with a one-handed melee weapon.

When you make a successful melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy with your one-handed melee weapon, the next ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) you make against that enemy with a one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack but not a melee attack, such as [Attack of Opportunity](../../../rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md). Either of these benefits is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

Your tricks discombobulate your opponent, leaving spots in their vision from the bright flash of your gunshot reflected straight into their eyes (or other visual organs). Attempt a [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) check against the target creature's Will DC and make a ranged firearm [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against that target. If the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) deals damage to the target creature and you succeed at the [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) check, the creature is [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.

# Hot Foot  [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm.
- **Activity** Single Action

Using a carefully aimed shot, you make a creature "dance." You shoot at the ground near a target's feet, causing them to react involuntarily; even mindless creatures have [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) responses to dodge an attack, and you can capitalize off those uncontrollable reflexes to achieve your aim. As they dance to the sweet tune of your pistol's retort, you ensure your foe can't use whatever nasty surprise they had planned in store for you and your allies. Make an attack roll against the Reflex DC of a target creature within your firearm's first range increment.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature can't use reactions, is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed), and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves. These effects last until the start of its next turn.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)

You're possessed with an incredibly vivacious spark that separates you not only from ordinary gun users and gunslingers, but even from other phenoms. Using that distinctive verve, when you perform impeccably and control the scene with your abilities, you also manage to set up your foes for disaster and ensure they remain in your sights for any follow-up attacks you want to make against them. If you critically succeed at a [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) check for Pistol Twirl or a pistol phenom archetype feat, you gain a +1 status bonus to your attack rolls with one-handed firearms and one-handed melee weapons until the end of your turn.

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You command the room, firing a gun into the air and ordering everyone to surrender and put their hands in the air. You fire your firearm and then attempt a single [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) each enemy within 30 feet. Creatures who become [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) instinctively put their hands in the air. If they had Raised a Shield, they lose the benefits, as they raise the shield above their head where it's of little use to block attacks. With their hands in the air, each of these [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creatures can't use reactions or free actions that require their hands, or items held in their hands, until the beginning of their next turn. Regardless of the result, each creature is then temporarily immune to Reach for the Sky for 1 minute.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Trick Shot](../../../compendium/feats/trick-shot-g-g.md) is intended for use with the Pistol Phenom Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded crossbow or firearm.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You shoot not at your foe but at an object nearby. Make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your firearm against an AC equal to an easy DC for your level (Core Rulebook 504). On a success, instead of hitting your foe, your attack hits an object behind or to the side of your target, creating one of the following effects. The GM might determine that a different AC is appropriate or that a particular effect isn't a valid option, such as using the explosive barrel option when there's no such object on the battlefield. The GM should inform you if a Trick Shot is feasible before you spend your actions, since your trained eye can easily recognize loose or volatile objects.

- **Dislodge Object** Your attack knocks an unattended object of no more than 2 Bulk out of position, moving it up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. For example, the weapon could knock a wizard's crystal ball off a table.
- **Explosive Barrel** Your attack strikes a barrel of expensive rum, a vial of volatile alchemical fluids, a demonic pustule erupting from the earth, or some other explosive object. The object explodes in a 20-foot burst, and creatures in the area take `6d6` damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The damage type is chosen by the GM, based on the exploding object. Increase the damage by `1d6` for every 2 levels you have above 10th.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Whirling Knockdown](../../../compendium/feats/whirling-knockdown-g-g.md) is intended for use with the Pistol Phenom Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded one-handed firearm and a one-handed melee weapon.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You fire your gun while throwing off a target's balance with your melee weapon. Then, you topple your foe to the ground with the quick orchestrated combination. You don't need to use brute force to do so, or even necessarily to hit with your gunshot; the effect is all about performing perfectly and eliminating your target's movements and options, leaving them no choice but to fall.

Make a ranged firearm [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature within the reach of your melee weapon and then attempt a [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) check against the creature's Reflex DC. If the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) critically succeeds, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its Reflex DC against this check. The [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) check has the following effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target falls and lands [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). It takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage from the fall.
> - **Success** The target falls and lands [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** Your plans backfired on you, and you're forced to drop your melee weapon in your space.

Your twirling weapons create a grand distraction that's difficult to look away from.

When using Pistol Twirl to [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md), you can target all enemies within your weapon's first range increment who you can perceive and who can see you.
