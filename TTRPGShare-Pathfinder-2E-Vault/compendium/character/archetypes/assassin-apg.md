# Assassin *Dedication Level 2*  

Targeted killing through stealth and subterfuge is the expertise of an assassin. While assassins are skilled in ending lives and many are evil, some live by a moral code, preying on the wicked, the cruel, or those who revel in unchecked aggression or power.

# Assassin Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alchemical Crafting](../../../compendium/feats/alchemical-crafting.md); trained in [Crafting](../../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting), [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception), and [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

You've trained to assassinate your foes, and you do so with tenacity and precision. You gain the Mark for Death activity.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Mark for Death [>>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

- **Requirements**: You can see and hear the creature you intend to mark

**Effect** You designate a single creature as your mark. This lasts until the mark dies or you use Mark for Death again. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) your mark and on [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md) against your mark. Your [agile](../../../rules/traits/agile.md) and [finesse](../../../rules/traits/finesse.md) weapons and unarmed attacks gain the [backstabber](../../../rules/traits/backstabber.md) and [deadly <d6>](../../../rules/traits/deadly.md) weapon traits when you're attacking your mark.

If the weapon or unarmed attack already has the [deadly](../../../rules/traits/deadly.md) trait, increase the size of the deadly damage die by one step instead of giving it [deadly <d6>](../../../rules/traits/deadly.md).
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the assassin archetype.

You act before foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Poison Weapon](../../../compendium/feats/poison-weapon.md) is intended for use with the Assassin Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a piercing or slashing weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You apply a [poison](../../../rules/traits/poison.md) to the required weapon; if you're not holding a poison and have a free hand, you can [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a poison as part of this action. If your next attack with that weapon before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, it applies the effects of the poison, provided that poison can be delivered by contact or injury. If you critically fail the attack roll, the poison is wasted as normal.

**Special.** During your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of simple injury poisons equal to your rogue level. These poisons deal `1d4` poison damage. Only you can apply these poisons properly, and they expire the next time you prepare.

All your [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature you have [Marked For Death](../../../compendium/feats/assassin-dedication-apg.md) have the [death](../../../rules/traits/death.md) trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. When killed in this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or a deity.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Assassinate](../../../compendium/feats/assassinate-apg.md) is intended for use with the Assassin Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Assassin Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/assassin-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You have designated a mark using Mark for Death and are completely [unnoticed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) by your mark.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You strike with one swift movement, trying to instantly slay your mark. Make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against your mark. If you hit, your mark takes `6d6` extra precision damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

If the mark critically fails, they die. This is an [incapacitation](../../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Assassinate for 1 day.
