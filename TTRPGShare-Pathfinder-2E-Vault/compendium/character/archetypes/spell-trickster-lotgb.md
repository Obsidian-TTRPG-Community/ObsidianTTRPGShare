# Spell Trickster *Dedication Level 2*  

Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade. In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks.

> [!pf2-example] The Fruits of Research
> 
> While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.
> 
> This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions.
> 
> The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic—but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.

# Spell Trickster Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Able to cast spells; trained in [Arcana](../../../compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../../../compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../../../compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../../../compendium/skills.md#Religion)

Your experience with magic and its traditions lets you specialize in the casting of certain spells, customizing familiar spells to create novel effects. Whenever you gain a feat from this archetype, you either learn to modify the effects of a single spell, or you change one of the modifications from a previous feat. Each time you [Cast the Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) corresponding to the feat you chose, you decide whether to cast its normal or modified version. You can only apply one modification to a spell at a time, even if you know more than one modification for that spell. Besides modifications mentioned in the feat, the spell functions as normal.

Choose up to two 4th-level spell trickster archetype feats for which you meet the spell-casting prerequisite. You gain those feats, ignoring their level prerequisite.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the spell trickster archetype. The two feats you gain from taking the dedication don't count toward this total.

If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.

When you cast [summon instrument](../../../compendium/spells/summon-instrument-apg.md), you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 1 minute.

Once per turn when you [Sustain the Spell](../../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), choose an opponent within 30 feet who can hear your performance.

The target must attempt a Will save against the spell's DC; on a failure, it becomes distracted by your performance and becomes [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round. The target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.

When you cast [sigil](../../../compendium/spells/sigil.md), you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: The target leaves a magical trail that you and others can try to follow. You and other creatures can attempt to [Track](../../../rules/actions/track.md) the target, substituting an [Arcana](../../../compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../../../compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../../../compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../../../compendium/skills.md#Religion) check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your [sigil](../../../compendium/spells/sigil.md) spell) for the [Survival](../../../compendium/skills.md#Survival) check. Much like [Tracking](../../../rules/actions/track.md) with [Survival](../../../compendium/skills.md#Survival), this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the [sigil](../../../compendium/spells/sigil.md) spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.

When you cast [dancing lights](../../../compendium/spells/dancing-lights.md), you can modify its duration to be 1 minute and modify its standard effects to create a single floating light in the shape of a Tiny creature, instead of up to four floating lights. The creature hovers over your head unless you spend a single action that has the [concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait to direct the light to move up to 30 feet, in which case it remains there until you direct it again. If you direct it back to your head, it hovers there and follows you again until you direct it elsewhere. If the light ever moves beyond 120 feet of you, it winks out immediately.

If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You cause a net to animate and throw itself at a Medium or smaller creature within 20 feet of the net. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. On a success, the target is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes; on a critical success, it's also [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it Escapes. The [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) DC is equal to your spell DC as long as the spell lasts. Once the spell ends, the [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) DC returns to the normal DC for a net (usually 16), and a creature adjacent to the target can [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to remove the net.

When you cast [mirror image](../../../compendium/spells/mirror-image.md), you can modify its duration to be sustained up to 1 minute and modify its range to 30 feet. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in an unoccupied square within range. The image takes up space and has a reach of 5 feet, and your allies can flank with the image. It doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have other than an AC equal to your spell DC and saving throw modifiers equal to your spell DC – 10.

**Heightened (3rd)** The disk can hold up to 10 Bulk. The spell no longer ends if you ride atop the disk (though it does if any other creature rides atop it, including if the creature is riding on you). If you are riding the disk, it changes its capacity to hold you, plus additional Bulk equal to the maximum you could carry without being [encumbered](../../../rules/conditions.md#Encumbered). If you ride atop the disk, you can direct it to move along the ground up to 30 feet or your Speed, whichever is slower, each time you [Sustain the Spell](../../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md).

Whenever a creature ends its turn in the area, the tentacles attempt to [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) that creature if it isn't already [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and they deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage to any creature already [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). Creatures treat the spell's area as difficult terrain.
