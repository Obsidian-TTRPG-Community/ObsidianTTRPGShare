# Horizon Walker *Dedication Level 2*  

Many long for the open road, but you prefer the trackless wild. You can find safe passage through the most inhospitable terrain in the world—icecaps, deserts, and similar environs are where you're comfortable. Your talents open untrod paths for you and help guide others through the wilderness.

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](../../../compendium/skills.md#Survival)

You've mastered travel within a specific type of terrain. You gain the Favored Terrain feat (Core Rulebook 171).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the horizon walker archetype.

Your time spent in the hostile parts of the world has inured you to extreme climates.

When other creatures [Follow the Expert](../../../rules/actions/follow-the-expert.md) with you as a guide in your favored terrain, they too treat temperature effects as one step less severe.
