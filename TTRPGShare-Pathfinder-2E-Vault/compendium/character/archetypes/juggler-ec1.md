- **Activity** Single Action

You make a thrown ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon, using the weapon's normal range increment. This attack doesn't trigger reactions, and if the target has never seen you use this feat before, the target is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against this attack.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Opportune Throw](../../../compendium/feats/opportune-throw-ec1.md) is intended for use with the Juggler Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance), [Juggler Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/juggler-dedication-ec1.md)
- **Trigger** A creature within 10 feet of you uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Requirements**: You are Juggling a thrown weapon.
- **Activity** Reaction

You make a thrown ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon against the triggering creature. If you critically succeed and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.

This [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count against your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).
