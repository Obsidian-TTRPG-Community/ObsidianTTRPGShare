# Elementalist *Dedication Level 2*  

You revere the four elements—air, earth, fire, and water—as the building blocks of creation and the source of all life. You believe that by balancing, mixing, and rearranging these four elements, magic is made. This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the four elements. You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the four elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace the four elements equally as a mystical quaternity, and they strengthen their connection to one of these elements each day to protect themselves from harm. Others, notably sorcerer and wizard elementalists, feel a stronger connection to a singular element that they hone to great heights, utilizing the other three elements to support and augment their favored element.

## Elemental Magic
<sup>SoM p. 206</sup>

You're a spellcaster that's specialized in harnessing the four elements. Though you might feel a stronger kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping all of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the [Elementalist Dedication](../../feats/elementalist-dedication-som.md) as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list.

**Elementalist Adjustments:** Replace your spell list with the elemental spell list. Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead.

If you're a sorcerer with the elemental bloodline, you can replace your [initial bloodline spell](../../spells/elemental-toss.md) with an initial elemental focus spell, and your [advanced bloodline spell](../../spells/elemental-motion.md) with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline.

**Druid Elementalist Adjustments:** If you're a druid of the storm order, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, [tempest surge](../../spells/tempest-surge.md), with [updraft](../../spells/updraft-som.md).

**Wizard Elementalist Adjustments:** If you're a wizard with an arcane school, instead of specializing in a school of magic, you specialize in one of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water. Any benefits your arcane school would grant you that are associated with a selected spell school, you instead apply to your selected element. For example, if you select air as your element, you can prepare only spells that have the [air](../../../rules/traits/air.md) trait in your extra arcane school slots, you can prepare an extra air cantrip, and you add an extra air spell from the elemental spell list to your spellbook. Additionally, in place of your arcane school spell, you learn the initial elemental focus spell of your selected element. In all other ways, your arcane school|Wizard||1 functions as written in the Core Rulebook. If you later select the [Advanced School Spell](../../feats/advanced-school-spell.md) wizard feat, instead of gaining the listed school spell, you gain the advanced elemental focus spell of your selected element.

# Elementalist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [class](../../../rules/traits/class-som.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: elemental magic

Each day when you make your daily preparations, you can attune yourself to one element of your choice: air, earth, fire, or water. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1 resistance) against damage dealt by effects with your attuned [elemental](../../../rules/traits/elemental.md) trait. This attunement lasts until you next make your daily preparations.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the elementalist archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/elementalist-dedication-som.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enhance your spell with elemental water, soaking the target. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) targeting a single creature, you soak the target of the spell with water.

If the target has [persistent acid](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) or fire damage, the DC to end those conditions is reduced to 10, and the creature can attempt a flat check to end those types of [persistent damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) immediately. The spell gains the [water](../../../rules/traits/water.md) trait (causing it to deal extra damage to creatures with weakness to water).

# Elemental Familiar  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/elementalist-dedication-som.md), Familiar

Your familiar becomes an elemental spirit capable of taking on aspects of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water.

Other than taking the form of an elemental instead of an animal, this familiar continues to use all the same rules as other familiars.

Your familiar gains one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following elemental familiar abilities. While your familiar has an elemental familiar ability, your familiar is composed of the associated elemental matter and gains the matching [elemental](../../../rules/traits/elemental.md) trait. You can't select more than one elemental familiar ability at a time.

- **Air** If your familiar stays completely still for 1 round, it becomes [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until it next takes an action. Any motion, even being moved or carried by another creature, ends this effect.
- **Earth** Your familiar gains resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to half your level.
- **Fire** Your familiar sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and emits warmth. Creatures that remain within a 15-foot emanation don't take damage from severe environmental cold.
- **Water** Your familiar can move through a gap at least 2 inches wide without [Squeezing](../../../rules/actions/squeeze.md) and can [Squeeze](../../../rules/actions/squeeze.md) through a gap at least 1 inch wide.

If the next action you use is to [Cast a non-cantrip Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that deals damage at a single target, the spell deals additional [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the spell level, in addition to its other effects. This has no effect if the spell already deals [persistent fire damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The spell gains the [fire](../../../rules/traits/fire.md) trait.

As you use your magic to manipulate air or water, you divert some of its currents to form a barrier around you.

This effect has the [air](../../../rules/traits/air.md) or [water](../../../rules/traits/water.md) trait, or both, depending on the traits of the spell you cast. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saves against effects with the [air](../../../rules/traits/air.md) trait, [water](../../../rules/traits/water.md) trait, or both until the start of your next turn, depending on the spell's traits.
