# Familiar Master *Dedication Level 2*  

From the wise owl perched on the wizard's shoulder to the crafty gremlin that serves the witch for their own reasons, the ghastly homunculus in the alchemist's lab to the clever monkey that picks the lock of the thief's cell, familiars have always served. Whether through rigorous training or a preternatural connection, yours serves better than most.

# Familiar Master Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  


You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn. Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar (Core Rulebook 198). If you already have a familiar, you gain the [Enhanced Familiar](../../../compendium/feats/enhanced-familiar-wizard.md) feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the familiar master archetype.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Enhanced Familiar (Wizard)](../../../compendium/feats/enhanced-familiar-wizard.md) is intended for use with the Familiar Master Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: a familiar

You infuse your familiar with additional magical energy. You can select four familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two.

**Special.** If your arcane thesis is improved familiar attunement, your familiar's base number of familiar abilities, before adding any extra abilities from the arcane thesis, is four.

- **Prerequisites**: [Familiar Master Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/familiar-master-dedication-apg.md), able to cast spells
- **Requirements**: You have line of effect to your familiar.
- **Activity** Single Action

Under your tutelage, your familiar has grown attuned to the hidden currents of the world and can serve as a conduit for your magic. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that has a range, the spell uses the familiar as its origin point.

Your familiar is the heart and soul of your adventuring team.

When selecting master abilities, you can choose an ally to benefit from any specific master ability. Each master ability can benefit only a single character, and you can select a specific master ability only once unless the ability says otherwise.

You find it easy to attract a powerful and unusual familiar to your side. The number of abilities required to make your familiar a specific familiar (page 147) is two lower than normal.

Your familiar's supernatural spirit has outgrown its corporeal body. You can conduct a special 10-minute activity to reselect certain familiar abilities, switching one or more of the following abilities for other abilities on this list: amphibious, burrower, climber, darkvision, fast movement, manual dexterity, resistance, and scent. You can reselect only familiar abilities you would normally be able to reselect each day, not required familiar abilities for your familiar. You can't remove an ability that is required for another ability your familiar has (for instance, you can't remove manual dexterity if the familiar has lab assistant).
