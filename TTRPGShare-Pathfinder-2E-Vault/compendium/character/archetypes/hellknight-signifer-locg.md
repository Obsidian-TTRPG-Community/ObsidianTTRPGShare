# Hellknight Signifer *Dedication Level 6*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

Signifers are the powerful and enigmatic Hellknight spellcasters who support and sometimes lead other Hellknights on their missions to enforce unwavering law. Formidable in their own right, signifers are trained to be unstoppable forces of order and authority when they stand alongside their martial counterparts.
