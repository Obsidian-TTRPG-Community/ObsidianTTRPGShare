# Staff Acrobat Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Dexterity 16; trained in [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics); trained in [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics); trained with at least one of the following weapons: staff, bo staff, halfling sling staff, or any weapon in the spear or polearm (referred to in this archetype as "your staff")

When you [High Jump](../../../rules/actions/high-jump.md), [Leap](../../../rules/actions/leap.md), or [Long Jump](../../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) while wielding your staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check required and add 5 feet to the distance you can [Leap](../../../rules/actions/leap.md) vertically and horizontally. You can [Shove](../../../rules/actions/shove.md) and [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) even if you don't have a free hand, provided you are wielding your staff. Finally, when you roll a success on a check to [Balance](../../../rules/actions/balance.md) while wielding your staff, you get a critical success instead.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the staff acrobat archetype.
