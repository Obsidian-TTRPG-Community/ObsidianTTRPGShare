# Duelist *Dedication Level 2*  

Across the world, students in martial academies practice with their blades to master one-on-one combat. The libraries of such schools hold deep troves of information detailing hundreds of combat techniques, battle stances, and honorable rules of engagement. Those who gain admission to such schools might train in formalized duels—and that's certainly the more genteel route to take. However, others assert that there's no better place to try out dueling techniques than in the life-and-death struggles common to an adventurer's life.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)

You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel, no matter the circumstances.

- **Prerequisites**: [Duelist Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/duelist-dedication-apg.md)

You have studied a great many combat techniques, which you can review each day. During your daily preparations, you can swap out any number of your duelist archetype feats for other duelist archetype feats of the appropriate level for which you are qualified. You can't swap out [Duelist Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/duelist-dedication-apg.md) or [Student of the Dueling Arts](../../../compendium/feats/student-of-the-dueling-arts-apg.md) in this way.

In addition, you can enter a stance from a duelist archetype feat you don't have (such as one listed under Additional Feats) by increasing the number of actions it takes to enter the stance by 1 (typically to 2 actions). You must still meet the feat's prerequisites.
