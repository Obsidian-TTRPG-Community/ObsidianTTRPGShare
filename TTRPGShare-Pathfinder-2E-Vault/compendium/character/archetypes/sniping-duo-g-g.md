# Sniping Duo *Dedication Level 2*  

Skilled shooters who don't let their egos get in the way of their efficacy are likely to say that sniping is a two-person job. Taking down a target without giving away your position or giving the opponent a window for reprisal is difficult work that requires teamwork and coordination, as well as a tight-knit bond and shared perspective. Sniping duos live and die by the credo "two heads are better than one," focusing their skills and strategies toward deadly efficiency. Whether your spotter and partner is a fellow ranged combatant or a melee enthusiast, you've learned how to use the openings they provide to devastating effect.

> [!pf2-example] CHOOSING A SPOTTER
> 
> The most important aspect when choosing a spotter for the sniping duo archetype is the out of character component; make sure you team up with another player who is excited about the idea of roleplaying out teamwork and coordination in combat, and with granting you benefits and gaining benefits from you. The mechanics of the archetype are not very demanding of your spotter's actions, but that still doesn't mean every player is interested in the narrative component.
> 
> Mechanically, a good spotter is likely either another ranged attacker or a melee attacker, and depending on the type of spotter you choose, certain feats might become more or less enticing. For instance, [Targeted Redirection](../../feats/targeted-redirection-g-g.md) is more useful with a melee spotter.

title: Sniping Duo Dedication, Feat 2
collapse: closed
# Sniping Duo Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in at least one type of weapon in the bow or firearm groups, trained in [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

When you take this dedication, choose one willing, non-minion ally to act as your spotter. As part of your training in this archetype, you train your spotter in the necessary habits and techniques to use your abilities automatically; your spotter doesn't need to spend any feats of their own to grant the effects. You only gain the benefits of your Sniping Duo archetype feats if both you and your spotter are alive and conscious. You and your spotter don't grant your foes lesser cover against one another's [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

Whenever you or your spotter successfully [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) a target, the other member of your duo gains a +1 circumstance bonus per weapon damage die on the damage roll of their next [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) made against that target before the end of their next turn.

You can change your designated spotter by spending 3 days of downtime training with another ally.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the sniping duo archetype.

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon
- **Activity** Single Action

With a quick shot, you interfere with a foe in combat. Make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon. If the strike hits, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn gains a +1 circumstance bonus on their roll, or a +2 circumstance bonus if your [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit.

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Single Action

You lay down suppressive fire to protect allies by forcing foes to take cover from your wild attacks. Make a firearm or crossbow [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md); the target must decide before you roll your attack whether it will duck out of the way. If the target ducks, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against your attack, or a +4 circumstance bonus to AC if it has cover. It also takes a –2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls until the end of its next turn. If the target chooses not to duck, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll for that [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)

Your spotter's quick signals help you make even difficult shots seem simple. As long as both you and your spotter can see the target of your attacks, you don't take a penalty for attacking within your weapon's second range increment.

The penalty you take for firing into further range increments is –3 for the third range increment, with an additional –2 penalty for each additional increment beyond the third (–5 for the fourth range increment, –7 for the fifth, and –9 for the sixth).

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Trigger** Your spotter critically succeeds at a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature, and that creature is within your ranged weapon's first range increment.
- **Activity** Reaction

You take advantage of your spotter's devastating attack to unleash your own follow-up attack. Make a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a –2 penalty against the target of the triggering attack.

This [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You aim a shot at your spotter, intending for your spotter to redirect that shot off their own weapon or shield to hit your foe from a better angle, and avoid your foe's cover.

If your next action is to make a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), you treat your spotter's position as your own for the purposes of determining cover and range. Your spotter must be within your weapon's first range increment and they must use a reaction to redirect your shot.

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

With assistance from your spotter, you aim for an especially accurate attack. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe either within your spotter's melee reach or the first range increment of a ranged weapon your spotter is wielding. On this [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's concealment. If you're using a firearm with the kickback trait, you don't take the normal circumstance penalty to this [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) for not having the required Strength score or firing without using a tripod.

# Vantage Shot  *Feat 8*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)

You and your spotter take advantage of each other's attacks to momentarily hide and throw your foes off-balance against your follow-up attack. When you successfully make a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe, your spotter can use a reaction to attempt a [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check against the foe's [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC.

On a success, the foe is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the spotter's next attack before the end of your spotter's next turn. Similarly, when your spotter successfully makes a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe, you can use a reaction to attempt a [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check against the foe's [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC. On a success, the foe is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your next attack against them before the end of your next turn.

# Tag Team  [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Trigger** You or your spotter misses with a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature, and the creature is within the other's melee reach or first range increment.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your skilled teamwork with your spotter enables you both to assist one another when you falter, using either other's failures as opportunities to strike. If you used Tag Team after your spotter missed the triggering [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), make a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the same target with a –2 penalty. If you used this reaction after you missed the triggering [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), your spotter can use their reaction to make a melee or ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the same target. [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) granted by this feat don't count toward your or your spotter's multiple attack penalty and your or your spotter's multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to the granted [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Deflecting Shot](../../../compendium/feats/deflecting-shot-g-g.md) is intended for use with the Sniping Duo Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Trigger** An ally within the first range increment of your firearm or crossbow is hit by an attack, and you can see the attacker.
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Reaction

You're always ready to take a quick shot to deflect a weapon or distract a foe enough to render them off target. The ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the triggering attack. You use this reaction after the result of the attack roll is revealed, so you know whether the +2 will make a sufficient difference.

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)

You and your spotter are adept at watching out for one another. As long as you can see or hear each other, neither of you is [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden), [undetected](../../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected), or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level or lower using a surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.

- **Trigger** An ally misses with a ranged attack that uses a thrown weapon or ammunition.
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Reaction

Seeing your ally's attack about to go astray, you fire your weapon to right its course.

Discharge your firearm and roll a d20. Your ally uses this roll instead of their own, and the attack ignores bonuses the target would gain against the attack from lesser or standard cover.

You and your spotter combine your efforts to bring down your target. If you and your spotter both use the [Ready](../../../rules/actions/ready.md) activity to make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the same opponent and choose the same trigger for the readied action, resolve your attacks at the same time. Each of you can use the higher of the two attack rolls for your [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), each using your own modifier; this is a [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md) effect. If both attacks are successful, total the damage for both attacks for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
