# Undead Master *Dedication Level 2*  

Not everyone with an interest in the undead raises a vast army of faceless, disposable minions. You prefer to cultivate a more personal relationship with a small number of undead companions, personalized to your needs and expectations. Those companions with minds trust you implicitly; those without are extensions of your will. Perhaps they see you as a teacher or caretaker, shepherding them on the path to peace and passing on, or perhaps they are your protectors, bound to aid you by negotiation and magical spells. Whatever the case, they will fight for and alongside you without question, throwing themselves into danger without hesitation if it will provide a means to your desired end.

This archetype works well for a necromancer capable of raising undead but isn't exclusive to them. You could be a warrior who befriended an undead, an evil champion granted an undead companion by your deity, or an undead bloodline sorcerer undead are drawn to.

The additional feats below are found in the [beastmaster](beastmaster-apg.md) archetype. Whenever one of these additional feats refers to an animal companion, as an undead master, you apply it to your undead companion instead.

# Undead Master Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: evil alignment

You gain the services of an undead companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. The rules for undead companions appear on page 37 and utilize those for animal companions from the Core Rulebook on page 214.

Contrary to the usual rules for companions, as an undead master it's possible for you to have more than one undead companion at a time. However, only one of those companions, your "active companion," follows you during exploration and encounters; the rest are reduced to an "inactive" state that can be easily tucked into an inventory or stored in a nearby crypt. If you ever have more than one undead companion, you gain the Call Companion action (Advanced Player's Guide 160), with your undead companions taking the place of animal companions.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the undead master archetype.

Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal companion that has the [minion](../../../rules/traits/minion.md) trait. See Beastmaster Animal Companions for rules on how having multiple animal companions works.

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once, gaining an additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of four total companions (including the one you gained from Beastmaster Dedication and possibly one you gained from sources other than the beastmaster archetype).

All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature animal companions and gaining additional capabilities (Core Rulebook 214). During an encounter, even if you don't use the [Command an Animal](../../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to either [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

- **Prerequisites**: an animal companion

You can urge your companion to do its utmost. You can spend 2 actions to [Command an Animal](../../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) instead of 1 when commanding your animal companion. If you do, your animal companion uses an additional action.

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Master Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/undead-master-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** You would take damage from a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) while one of your undead companions is adjacent to you.
- **Activity** Reaction

You magically divert some of the harm from an incoming attack away from yourself, forcing your undead companion to take it in your stead. Reduce the damage you take from the triggering [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) by 2 + your level. Your adjacent undead companion loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount of damage reduced. If you have more than one adjacent undead companion, you choose which one loses Hit Points. You can't divert the damage to a temporary fragment from [Their Master's Call](../../../compendium/feats/their-masters-call-botd.md).

- **Prerequisites**: [Mature Beastmaster Companion](../../../compendium/feats/mature-beastmaster-companion-apg.md)

Your mature animal companions continue to grow and develop.

They each become nimble or savage animal companions (your choice, choose for each companion, including those that become mature after you take this feat), gaining additional capabilities determined by the type of companion.

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Master Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/undead-master-dedication-botd.md), Call Companion, at least one inactive undead companion whose remains or anchor are currently in your possession.
- **Activity** Single Action

In a pinch, you pull one of your inactive companions from their rest to provide a companion's support benefit. A fragment of your companion materializes or assembles itself in an unoccupied square of your choice within 30 feet of you, grants you its support benefit, and then disappears on your next turn. If it takes any damage before your next turn, it disappears or collapses (as applicable) and the support benefit ends immediately.

- **Prerequisites**: [Incredible Beastmaster Companion](../../../compendium/feats/incredible-beastmaster-companion-apg.md)

Your nimble and savage animal companions become cunning enough to become specialized. Each companion gains one specialization of your choice (Core Rulebook 217, choose separately).

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, add a different specialization to your nimble and savage companions. Your nimble and savage companions can have up to three specializations each.

- **Prerequisites**: [Mature Beastmaster Companion](../../../compendium/feats/mature-beastmaster-companion-apg.md), you have multiple animal companions

You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it's slightly more difficult to Command them. If you don't Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), as per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but not both. When you [Command an Animal](../../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md), either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). Either way, you can't [Command an Animal](../../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) to make either companion act again until your next turn.
