# Bullet Dancer *Dedication Level 2*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

While most monastic orders and traditional fighting schools shun firearms as loud and unreliable technology for unskilled conscripts, you fuse flourishing feints and ricocheting gunplay into a whirling ballet of bullets. As a bullet dancer, you might become the target of brash duelists and gladiators looking to make a name for themselves. But you tend to welcome the attention and might have proven your reputation while dancing your deadly ballet in tournaments from Tymon to Goka. You've found your fluid motions and explosive attacks to be surefire crowd-pleasers, even as they serve to confound and shock your foes.

# Bullet Dancer Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in unarmored defense and trained in simple weapons

You've learned how to synchronize traditional martial arts and guns. You gain the Bullet Dancer Stance action. Whenever your proficiency in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you gain that new proficiency with bayonets, reinforced stocks, simple firearms and unarmed attacks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Bullet Dancer Stance [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[stance](../../../rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're unarmored and wielding a simple firearm, [bayonet](../../../compendium/equipment/items/bayonet-g-g.md), or [reinforced stock](../../../compendium/equipment/items/reinforced-stock-g-g.md)

**Effect** You enter a specialized stance for a unique martial art centered around the use of simple firearms. While in this stance, the only [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are those using bayonets, reinforced stocks, and simple firearms. You can use Flurry of Blows with these weapons. You can use your other monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks with bayonets and reinforced stocks, so long as the feat or ability doesn't require a single, specific Strike. You can also use them with simple firearms when attacking within half the first range increment.  
%% #trait/stance %%
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the bullet dancer dedication archetype.

You know how to make the most of your attacks when fighting hand-to-hand. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of unarmed strikes in the brawling group and weapons in the brawling group. If you have [Monastic Weaponry](../../../compendium/feats/monastic-weaponry.md), you also gain the critical specialization effects of all monk weapons in which you are trained.

- **Activity** Varies ([>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") OR [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action"))

You fire your weapon as you jump, using the kickback to go farther. You [Leap](../../../rules/actions/leap.md) and discharge your firearm to add a +10-foot status bonus to the distance traveled. If you spend 2 actions for Black Powder Boost, you [High Jump](../../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) instead.

**Special.** An ability that allows you to [High Jump](../../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) as a single action (like the [Quick Jump](../../../compendium/feats/quick-jump.md) skill feat) lets you use Black Powder Boost as a single action for those jumps as well.

# Bullet Dancer Burn  *Feat 6*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Bullet Dancer Stance
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a firearm with an attached [bayonet](../../../compendium/equipment/items/bayonet-g-g.md) or [reinforced stock](../../../compendium/equipment/items/reinforced-stock-g-g.md).

The fiery blaze of your weapons combined with your unorthodox technique leaves your opponents with little opportunity to capitalize on any gaps in your defenses, or properly defend themselves against your onslaught. While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you successfully [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) an opponent with a bayonet or reinforced stock attached to your firearm, the next ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) you make against that opponent doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack, such as [Attack of Opportunity](../../../rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md). While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you make a successful ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against an opponent within your melee reach using a firearm, the next reinforced stock or bayonet attack attached to that firearm deals an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die.

The benefit on your next [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) from either use of Bullet Dancer Burn is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.

- **Prerequisites**: [Black Powder Boost](../../../compendium/feats/black-powder-boost-g-g.md)

You've learned to react with ranged weapons when a creature is in close quarters. You can use a reaction that normally allows you to make a melee weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) to instead make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). You must be Striking an adjacent target. If necessary for the reaction's trigger, you treat your ranged weapon as if it had a reach of 5 feet. If the reaction has other requirements, such as wielding a specific kind of weapon, Snap Shot doesn't allow you to ignore them; it allows you only to replace a melee weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).

- **Requirements**: You're in Bullet Dancer Stance
- **Activity** Single Action

You've learned to reload your simple firearms with uncanny grace, the ammunition simply falling into place as though part of a well-practiced kata. You [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a simple firearm, and then [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to reload that same firearm. You don't need a free hand to reload your simple firearm in this way.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Trick Shot](../../../compendium/feats/trick-shot-g-g.md) is intended for use with the Bullet Dancer Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded crossbow or firearm.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You shoot not at your foe but at an object nearby. Make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your firearm against an AC equal to an easy DC for your level (Core Rulebook 504). On a success, instead of hitting your foe, your attack hits an object behind or to the side of your target, creating one of the following effects. The GM might determine that a different AC is appropriate or that a particular effect isn't a valid option, such as using the explosive barrel option when there's no such object on the battlefield. The GM should inform you if a Trick Shot is feasible before you spend your actions, since your trained eye can easily recognize loose or volatile objects.

- **Dislodge Object** Your attack knocks an unattended object of no more than 2 Bulk out of position, moving it up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. For example, the weapon could knock a wizard's crystal ball off a table.
- **Explosive Barrel** Your attack strikes a barrel of expensive rum, a vial of volatile alchemical fluids, a demonic pustule erupting from the earth, or some other explosive object. The object explodes in a 20-foot burst, and creatures in the area take `6d6` damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The damage type is chosen by the GM, based on the exploding object. Increase the damage by `1d6` for every 2 levels you have above 10th.

When determining whether a target has cover from your ranged attack with a firearm or crossbow, you can choose one solid surface within your weapon's first range increment to ricochet your shot off of. If you do, you determine the target's cover from the point where you ricochet your shot instead of from you.
