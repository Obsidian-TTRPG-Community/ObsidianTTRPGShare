# Trick Driver *Dedication Level 2*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

While cavaliers follow an old and tired tradition of mounted combat, you take a more modern road. Through aggressive use of vehicles, you roll across the battlefield, taking down your opponents. You go beyond simply operating a vehicle, pushing it to perform stunts that its builders never intended, transforming the vehicle into something much greater than a mere conveyance.

# Trick Driver Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You are equally at home piloting any vehicle, adapting yourself instantly to varied controls, movements, and handling.

Whenever piloting a vehicle requires a [Piloting Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Sailing Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) check, you can use your [Driving Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) proficiency instead.

You can use Dexterity in place of Intelligence when attempting piloting checks with [Driving Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore). You become an expert in [Driving Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore). At 7th level, you become a master in [Driving Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), and at 15th level, you become legendary in [Driving Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the trick driver archetype.

# Express Driver  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [exploration](../../../rules/traits/exploration.md)  [skill](../../../rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Trick Driver Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/trick-driver-dedication-g-g.md)

You can optimize your vehicle's performance, coaxing extra speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns.

When calculating your travel speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a [Driving Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) check to increase your vehicle's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.

You [Drive](../../../rules/actions/drive-gmg.md) with a –2 penalty to your piloting check, gaining the effects of the [Drive](../../../rules/actions/drive-gmg.md) action for the same number of actions you spent to Power Slide.
