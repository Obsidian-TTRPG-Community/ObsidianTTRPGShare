# Bright Lion *Dedication Level 2*  

You are one of the Bright Lions, part revolutionary warrior, part undercover spy.

# Bright Lion Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: [Bright Lion](../../../compendium/character/backgrounds/bright-lion-lowg.md) background
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Bright Lions, not a worshipper of Walkena, trained in [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

You become trained in your choice of [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and in [Mzali Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [Lie](../../../rules/actions/lie.md) or [Impersonate](../../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.

# Warding Light  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bright Lion Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/bright-lion-dedication-lol.md)

You gain a tattoo that serves as a special ward to defend you against Walkena's forces.

The tattoo allows you to cast the [light](../../../compendium/spells/light.md) cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. If you die, the tattoo immediately casts gentle repose on your corpse, heightened to the same spell level.

# Sun's Fury  *Feat 6*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bright Lion Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/bright-lion-dedication-lol.md)

The Old Sun Gods have granted you a gift in your fight against Walkena. You gain the sun's fury focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [Refocus](../../../rules/actions/refocus.md) activity to pray to the Old Sun Gods; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your Bright Lion focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, if you aren't already, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability score.

# Elude The Divine  *Feat 8*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bright Lion Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/bright-lion-dedication-lol.md)

You are able to escape inquisitions involving divine magic, allowing you to blend in well in Mzali but also to avoid unwanted attention in other oppressive theocracies. You gain the [Slippery Secrets](../../../compendium/feats/slippery-secrets.md) skill feat, and its benefits also apply against [divination](../../../rules/traits/divination.md) effects that attempt to discern your deity. When using Slippery Secrets against a divine divination, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and on a critical success, the divination reveals false information appropriate to your false persona, rather than nothing.
