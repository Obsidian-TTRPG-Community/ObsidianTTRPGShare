# Magaambyan Attendant *Dedication Level 2*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

Magaambyans attendants have become full members of the Magaambya and begun to learn the secrets of the university. Not all Magaambyan attendants necessarily have this archetype, and this archetype doesn't represent the abilities of all attendants; rather, the archetype represents many of those who have affiliated with a branch and are pursuing conversant rank.

# Magaambyan Attendant Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Arcana](../../../compendium/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](../../../compendium/skills.md#Nature), member of the Magaambya of attendant rank

You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain the ability to cast a single arcane or primal cantrip of your choice, (as is normal for cantrips, it is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level, rounded up). If you weren't already, you become trained in that tradition's spell DCs and spell attack rolls, with Intelligence as your spellcasting ability if you choose arcane or Wisdom as your spellcasting ability if you choose primal.

Regardless of whether you choose an arcane or primal cantrip, you also either become trained in [Arcana](../../../compendium/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](../../../compendium/skills.md#Nature), or an expert in one of those skills in which you were already trained.

When you gain this feat, choose to affiliate with the Cascade Bearers, Emerald Boughs, Rain–Scribes, Tempest-Sun Mages, or Uzunjati. This grants you additional feats available to only that branch.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat other than Halcyon Speaker Dedication until you have gained two other feats from the Magaambyan Attendant or halcyon speaker archetype.

# Mask Familiar  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md)

Your mask takes on a personality of its own, allowing it to serve as your familiar. Though you can still wear it as a mask, you can detach it from your face to grant it a bodily form of colored light that allows it to move around; usually, this is a miniature form of the animal the mask represents. Detaching or reattaching the familiar to transform it is a two-action activity. Even in mask form, the familiar can move around on its master's face and speaks in a distinct voice (if it can talk). It is easily recognized as more than a simple mask unless the familiar succeeds at a [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to [Impersonate](../../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) a mask. Other than its appearance and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars. Your mask familiar has access to the mask freeze familiar ability.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), member of the Magaambya of conversant rank

You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells (see Halcyon Spells on page 100). In addition to being able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you also gain a 1st-level halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the halcyon speaker archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Cascade Bearers affiliation
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: You haven't yet acted on your turn.
- **Activity** Free Action

You call upon your Cascade Bearer training to help you adjust a spell for the current situation. Until the end of your turn, you gain a single metamagic feat from the druid class or the wizard class that has a level requirement of no more than half your level.

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Emerald Boughs affiliation, expert in [Society](../../../compendium/skills.md#Society)

You are comfortable and socially capable in almost any cultural context. When you use the [Society](../../../compendium/skills.md#Society) skill to [Subsist](../../../rules/actions/subsist.md), if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead; if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead; and if you roll a critical success, you can provide for another additional creature. Furthermore, when you attempt a [Society](../../../compendium/skills.md#Society) check to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about cultural practices and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Rain-Scribes affiliation

You use the power of your Rain-Scribe magic to draw on a stream of primal power for sustenance. You don't need to eat or drink and need only 6 hours of rest to feel well rested. You must still rest at least 8 hours and spend 1 hour of preparation to regain resources usable only a limited number of times per day, such as spell slots.

You can draw on primal power to stay awake and alert while otherwise resting your body and mind, gaining the full benefits of an 8-hour rest without falling asleep. When you do, you lose the other benefits of Rain- Scribe Sustenance for 1 week while your primal energies recharge.

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Tempest-Sun Mages affiliation
- **Activity** Single Action

If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from your spell slots that damages other creatures, you can bend some of that spell's offensive energy, protecting allies in the area and boosting your own defenses against certain foes. Select any number of targets of the spell and reduce the spell's damage to those targets by an amount equal to the spell's level. Until your next turn, when one of those targets damages you, that damage is reduced by twice the spell's level.

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Uzunjati affiliation, master in a [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) skill
- **Activity** Single Action

You tell a quick story or begin telling a longer tale. This is most useful when you want to prove your scholarly credibility or impress someone quickly. Roll a check with a skill that can be used to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) in which you have expert proficiency, using the result entry for the [Perform](../../../rules/actions/perform.md) action. Like Performing, Storytelling rarely has an effect on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks against the observers—or even change their attitudes—if the GM sees fit. This action is not a [Performance](../../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) and cannot be used in place of anything that requires you to [Perform](../../../rules/actions/perform.md).

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Cascade Bearers affiliation

Your Cascade Bearer training allows you to broaden the horizons of your halcyon spells further than most Magaambyans, weaving in spiritual magic. You can select halcyon spells from the divine or occult spell lists in additional to the arcane or primal spell lists, though they are still halcyon spells (so you choose when casting if they are arcane or primal spells). You gain a halcyon cantrip and a halcyon 1st-level spell.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Emerald Boughs affiliation

You use Emerald Bough techniques to create a small extradimensional space called a hideaway that lasts as long as you are conscious. The hideaway functions as a type I bag of holding, but has no Bulk and takes no hands; it holds one object with a maximum Bulk equal to your highest mental ability score modifier; as you open the hideaway with pure thought, activating it to retrieve an item is a free action with the envision component instead of a single action with the [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) component. The hideaway's access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful [dispel magic](../../../compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway's counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). After a successful [dispel magic](../../../compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell or when you become conscious again, the hideaway immediately reforms with no additional action from you. You can also dismiss the hideaway (if it is empty) or re-form it using a single action with the envision component.

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Rain-Scribes affiliation
- **Activity** Two-Action

You surround yourself in a mantle of Rain-Scribe magic and [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) twice; difficult terrain does not reduce your Speed, even if the difficult terrain has been manipulated by magic. Your magic clears the difficult terrain in each square you entered; until your next turn, those squares aren't difficult terrain for any creature walking through them (or are normal difficult terrain if they were previously greater difficult terrain).

You transform unrealized spell energy into a protective shield. If you're a spontaneous spellcaster, expend a spell slot; if you're a prepared spellcaster, expend a spell prepared in a spell slot. Reduce the triggering damage by an amount equal to four times the level of the expended slot or spell.

[Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) with a skill in which you have master proficiency, then use Uzunjati Storytelling with the same skill. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill check for Uzunjati Storytelling from the added details.

Halcyon Speaker One of Old-Mage Jatembe's central lessons was that magic was magic, no matter what the source. Though the Magaambya seeks to hold true to Jatembe's teachings by aiming to understand magic of all kinds, the mages of the Magaambya have found the most success with magic rooted in the material world. Halcyon speakers are powerful conversants who epitomize the Magaambyan practice of blending arcane and primal magic, seeing both traditions as flowing from the same wellspring.

Your magic is drawn to your persistent creations. While you are within 30 feet of and have line of effect to your persistent creation, you can use it as the origin point for your line or cone spells. For instance, a lightning bolt could originate from the persistent creation rather than from you.
