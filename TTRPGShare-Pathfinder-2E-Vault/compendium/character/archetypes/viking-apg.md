# Viking *Dedication Level 2*  

To go "a-viking" is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or, as they call it, the "whale-road") to ambush coastal communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary.

# Viking Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You're trained in [Sailing Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore). When moving through water using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success for your [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Swim](../../../rules/actions/swim.md), you get a critical success instead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the viking archetype.

# Hurling Charge  [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Viking Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/viking-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a thrown weapon you already have in your hand, [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md), and then [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw another weapon. If you are [raging](../../../rules/actions/rage.md), you can add the additional damage with melee weapons you receive from [raging](../../../rules/actions/rage.md) to your damage with the thrown weapon.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Reactive Shield](../../../compendium/feats/reactive-shield.md) is intended for use with the Viking Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Trigger** An enemy hits you with a melee [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a shield.
- **Activity** Reaction

You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the last second. You immediately use the [Raise a Shield](../../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) action and gain your shield's bonus to AC. The circumstance bonus from the shield applies to your AC when you're determining the outcome of the triggering attack.

# Viking Weapon Familiarity  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Viking Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/viking-dedication-apg.md)

From childhood, you have been exposed to traditional viking weapons, and you soon learned to handle them in battle. Now, you can raid proudly alongside your fellows. You are trained with the [battle axe](../../../compendium/equipment/items/battle-axe.md), [hatchet](../../../compendium/equipment/items/hatchet.md), [longsword](../../../compendium/equipment/items/longsword.md), and [shortsword](../../../compendium/equipment/items/shortsword.md). In addition, you gain the [Shield Block](../../../compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction.

collapse: closed
# Second Shield  [F](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Viking Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/viking-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** Your [Shield Block](../../../compendium/feats/shield-block.md) causes your shield to break or be destroyed.
- **Activity** Free Action

You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself. You can [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield—for example, a table or chair— you can [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield. Your new shield isn't raised until you use the [Raise a Shield](../../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) action, as normal.

When your shield is up, your enemies' blows can't touch you. When you have your [shield raised](../../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), you can [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) to move half your Speed without triggering reactions that are triggered by your movement (such as [Attacks of Opportunity](../../../rules/abilities/attack-of-opportunity.md)). You can use Shielded Stride while Flying or Swimming instead of [Striding](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

You gain the critical specialization effects of the [battle axe](../../../compendium/equipment/items/battle-axe.md), [hatchet](../../../compendium/equipment/items/hatchet.md), [longsword](../../../compendium/equipment/items/longsword.md), and [shortsword](../../../compendium/equipment/items/shortsword.md). Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in the above four weapons.
