# Soulforger *Dedication Level 2*  
[uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

Your devotion to a cause unifies your soul with an armament tethered to the very essence of your spirit.

## Essence Powers
<sup>SoM p. 236</sup>

Your soulforged armament has an essence power you choose when you first bind it. It gains the power temporarily when you manifest its essence form. Each power has a _Corruption Flaw_ that affects you if you have soulforged corruption. Essence powers that only apply to some types of armament indicate which.

**Adaptable Persona** ([transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)) Armor only. When you manifest the essence form, gain your choice of a climb Speed or swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you're 8th level or higher, you can choose a fly Speed instead. _Corruption Flaw_ You take a –10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.

**Bounding Spirit** Melee weapon only. The weapon gains the [thrown](../../../rules/traits/thrown.md) 30 feet trait and has the [returning](../../equipment/items/returning.md) rune (even if it already has its maximum number of property runes). _Corruption Flaw_ When you make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a thrown or ranged weapon and miss, reroll the [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md), targeting your ally nearest to the target. This [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) uses the same multiple attack penalty as the missed [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.

**Deep-Seeded Fear** You gain a +2 status bonus to your [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation) checks and don't take any penalties for not sharing a language when [Demoralizing](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) foes who can perceive your armament's essence form. When you manifest the essence form, you can attempt to [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) an enemy who can perceive the manifestation. _Corruption Flaw_ If you attempt to [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) an enemy, your [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) also targets the ally closest to you.

**Determined Toughness** Any status penalties you take from the following conditions are 1 less than their condition's value: [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained), [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied). This doesn't change the actual condition value, or any other effects of the condition (such as [stupefied's](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) disruption and its DC). _Corruption Flaw_ Whenever you take a status penalty from the listed conditions, you also take a –1 penalty to the same statistics.

**Harmful Malice** ([necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md), [negative](../../../rules/traits/negative.md)) Your [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) deal an additional `1d4` negative damage. Once while the armament is manifested, you can cast [harm](../../spells/harm.md) as an innate spell, with a level equal to half your level rounded up. _Corruption Flaw_ Reduce any damage you would deal by half your level.

**Heroic Heart** ([enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md), [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)) You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks, skill checks, and saves. _Corruption Flaw_ You take a –1 penalty to attack rolls.

**Healing Grace** ([healing](../../../rules/traits/healing.md), [necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md), [positive](../../../rules/traits/positive.md)) You gain fast healing equal to half your level. You can cast [heal](../../spells/heal.md) once as an innate spell with a level equal to half your level rounded up. _Corruption Flaw_ Reduce all healing you would receive or grant with a spell by half your level.

**Magical Resilience** ([abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)) Armor or shield only. You gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws and AC against spells. If you're 5th level or higher, you can cast [dispel magic](../../spells/dispel-magic.md) once as an innate spell. The spell level is equal to 1 lower than half your level rounded up (2nd level if you're 5th or 6th level, and so on). _Corruption Flaw_ You take a –1 penalty to saving throws and AC against spells.

**Planar Bond** ([abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)) Armor or shield only. When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. You gain resistance equal to your level + 2 to damage of the selected type. _Corruption Flaw_ You gain weakness 1 to all damage.

**Planar Pain** ([evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)) Weapon only. When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. Attacks with the weapon deal this type of damage instead of their physical damage with a +2 status bonus to the damage. _Corruption Flaw_ When you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed attack, you take 2 damage of the last type you chose for planar pain, even if the damage type normally wouldn't harm you, such as good damage if you aren't evil.

**Pull of Stasis** ([transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)) Weapon only. Any time you hit with the soulforged weapon, the target takes a –10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. On a critical hit, the creature is [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round instead. _Corruption Flaw_ You take a –10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.

**Reflecting Spirit** Armor or shield only. You gain a +2 status bonus to AC against physical ranged attacks. If an enemy's physical ranged attack misses you, you can use your reaction to immediately attempt a ranged [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the attacker using the projectile that missed. _Corruption Flaw_ You have weakness 5 to physical ranged attacks.

**Resolute Defiance** Shield only. The shield gains a +2 status bonus to its Hardness and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level + 2 that last until the essence effect ends. If you don't have the [Shield Block](../../feats/shield-block.md) reaction, you gain it while your shield is manifested. _Corruption Flaw_ When you take damage while [Raising a Shield](../../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) or use [Shield Block](../../feats/shield-block.md), attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, the shield is Dismissed if it's your soulforged armament or Dropped if it's a different shield.

# Soulforger Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Wis 14 or ability to cast divine spells

You can manifest the power of your spirit in combat to realize your motivations. You manifest an armor, shield, or weapon as a soulforged armament (page 232). Choose one essence power for the armament (below). Changing an essence power requires 1 week of retraining, and you can't retrain it while you have soulforged corruption.

You can Manifest Soulforged Armament to summon your armaments in combat.

title: Manifest Soulforged Armament [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [conjuration](../../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [divine](../../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [extradimensional](../../../rules/traits/extradimensional.md)  

- **Requirements**: If summoning a weapon or shield, you have the hands free to wield it; if summoning armor, you aren't wearing any armor

**Effect** You immediately wield or wear the soulforged armament bound to you. The soulforged armament remains manifested until you [Dismiss](../../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) this effect.

Once per day when you use this ability, you can manifest the armament's essence form. You gain the armament's essence power until it's Dismissed.

After 1 minute, the essence form armament is automatically Dismissed.

[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Soulforger Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/soulforger-dedication-som.md)
- **Trigger** An attack you made with a soulforged weapon or shield misses a creature, or a creature hits you with an attack while you're either wearing manifested soulforged armor or have your soulforged shield raised.
- **Requirements**: Your soulforged armament is manifested.
- **Activity** Reaction

You strive to change the outcome with sheer zeal. You gain a +1 status bonus to your attack roll if making an attack or to your AC if you were hit. This can change the outcome of the roll. If this bonus turns your missed attack into a hit or the hit against you into a miss, attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, your soulforged armament is Dismissed—your weapon if you attacked or your armor or shield if you were defending.

# Soul Arsenal  *Feat 6*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Soulforger Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/soulforger-dedication-som.md)

Choose an additional soulforged armament of a different type than the type you already chose, and choose one essence power for it. Upgrade and change armaments individually.

When you Manifest Soulforged Armament, you can summon any number of your armaments (you must meet the Requirements for each), and when you [Dismiss](../../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the effect, you can choose to [Dismiss](../../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) some and not others. You can choose to manifest the essence form of any number of your armaments when you take the action. Each armament can manifest its essence form only once per day.

When you gain soulforged corruption, choose one armament's corruption flaw to affect you for stage 1.

At stage 2, you take the flaws of all your soulforged armaments. While you have the curse, each armament gets a separate flat check to manifest its essence form, and failing prevents you from manifesting only that armament's essence form.

**Special.** You can select this feat a second time at 12th level or higher, choosing the final item type.
