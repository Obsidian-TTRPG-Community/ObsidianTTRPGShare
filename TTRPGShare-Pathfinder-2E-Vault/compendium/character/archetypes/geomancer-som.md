# Geomancer *Dedication Level 2*  

You know how to draw power from the land around you, no matter the terrain, by attuning your magic to match its mystical properties.

You might be a druid with an elemental focus (such as the flame, stone, or wave orders) or a naturalist with a touch of magic at your disposal. You could concentrate on a single type of terrain to wring every last drop of power from it or choose to wander the land to experience every type of terrain possible.

# Geomancer Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Nature](../../../compendium/skills.md#Nature); ability to cast spells from spell slots; at least one spell with the [air](../../../rules/traits/air.md), [cold](../../../rules/traits/cold.md), [earth](../../../rules/traits/earth.md), [fire](../../../rules/traits/fire.md), [plant](../../../rules/traits/plant.md), or [water](../../../rules/traits/water.md) trait

You feel a deep connection to the world no matter where you are, a phenomenon known as "terrain attunement." When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell with a trait that corresponds to the type of terrain you are currently in (as listed below), you gain the terrain attunement effect for that type of terrain. The GM might determine an attunement applies as long as it's prevalent enough around you. For instance, you might be in aquatic terrain on a riverbank or on a boat. Similarly, one place might count as multiple types of terrain, such as a mountain in the far north being both arctic and mountain. In this case, you choose only one terrain attunement effect, even if the spell has traits that would apply to each terrain type.

Certain terrain attunements affect your enemies instead of you. If they do, when you cast the spell you apply the listed effect to all enemies who are either adjacent to you, in the area of the spell, or targeted by the spell. These enemies receive the listed saving throw against your spell DC to attempt to avoid the effect.

- **Aquatic** ([water](../../../rules/traits/water.md)) You ride the currents of water. If you're in the water, you gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you're on a surface, temporary waves of water follow your movements, allowing you to use your swim Speed—if you have one—as your land Speed.
- **Arctic** ([cold](../../../rules/traits/cold.md)) Arctic rime covers your foes' bodies. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. They take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 2 rounds (–10-foot on a critical failure).
- **Desert** ([fire](../../../rules/traits/fire.md)) The scorching heat of the desert dehydrates your foes. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, they're [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) until they drink water or another potable liquid.
- **Forest** ([plant](../../../rules/traits/plant.md)) Branches and vines reach out to get in your foes' way. Enemies must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, they become [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round ([clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) on a critical failure).
- **Mountain** ([earth](../../../rules/traits/earth.md)) The rugged endurance of the mountain protects you from harm. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to the spell level for 1 round.
- **Plains** ([plant](../../../rules/traits/plant.md)) The growing fields and pulsing vitality of the plains provide you vigor. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spell level for 1 round.
- **Sky** ([air](../../../rules/traits/air.md)) A gust of wind carries you aloft. You can [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md) up to 10 feet. If you're in the air at the end of the turn and don't have a fly Speed, you fall.
- **Swamp** ([plant](../../../rules/traits/plant.md)) Your magic draws in noxious swamp gas to fumigate your foes. Affected foes take [persistent poison damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to half the spell's level (minimum 1 damage) with a basic Fortitude save.
- **Underground** ([earth](../../../rules/traits/earth.md)) The endless darkness of the cavern depths opens up its secrets to your senses. For 1 round, you gain [darkvision](../../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) as well as imprecise [tremorsense](../../../rules/abilities/tremorsense.md) out to 15 feet.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the geomancer archetype.

# Attunement Shift  [F](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Geomancer Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/geomancer-dedication-som.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Requirements**: Your previous action was to cast a spell with the [air](../../../rules/traits/air.md), [cold](../../../rules/traits/cold.md), [earth](../../../rules/traits/earth.md), [fire](../../../rules/traits/fire.md), [plant](../../../rules/traits/plant.md), or [water](../../../rules/traits/water.md) trait
- **Activity** Free Action

The magic of your spell floods into you, overriding your connection to the land around you. You alter your terrain attunement to a terrain that matches a trait of the spell you just cast. You thereby gain your terrain attunement benefit when you cast further spells with the same descriptor, instead of using the terrain you're actually in. For instance, if you cast [tanglefoot](../../../compendium/spells/tanglefoot.md), your terrain attunement switches to your choice of forest or swamp, and your terrain attunement applies when you cast another plant spell.

Your terrain attunement reverts to that of the terrain you're in 1 minute after you use Attunement Shift.

# Shared Attunement  *Feat 4*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Geomancer Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/geomancer-dedication-som.md)

When you would gain a benefit from your terrain attunement, you can grant it to one ally within 30 feet instead of yourself.

This has no effect if the terrain attunement affects your foes instead of granting you a benefit.

- **Requirements**: You gained a terrain attunement benefit this turn.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a stance that makes it difficult to move around you. Each square adjacent to you becomes difficult terrain that matches the terrain attunement you gained (rime forms in an arctic terrain, momentary undergrowth shoots up in a forest terrain, and so on). You ignore this difficult terrain.

This stance ends if you move into a different type of terrain.

- **Requirements**: Your terrain attunement matches the terrain you're in and you're in Rough Terrain Stance.
- **Activity** Single Action

You slam your fist into the ground or twirl your arms about to cause the terrain around you to shift and ripple, potentially throwing others off balance. Each creature within your area of difficult terrain from Rough Terrain Stance must attempt a Reflex saving throw against your spell DC with the following effects. After you use this action, you can't use it again for `1d4` rounds.

> [!success-degree]

- **Prerequisites**: [Geomancer Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/geomancer-dedication-som.md), master in [Nature](../../../compendium/skills.md#Nature)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** A [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) would damage you.
- **Requirements**: You gained a terrain attunement benefit since the start of your most recent turn and that attunement matches the terrain you're in.

You're so attuned to the land that it rises up to protect you from a potentially fatal blow in a seeming coincidence. For instance, a branch suddenly falls from a nearby tree to take the brunt of a sword swing or a surprising change of current disrupts an enemy's attack. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to double your level against the triggering [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md).
