# Investigator *Dedication Level 2*  

You've developed a keen eye for investigating mysteries.

## Multiclass Investigator characters
<sup>APG p. 151</sup>

The investigator archetype is a good choice for a character that wants deeper investigations or to plan out their turns in advance; it's a particularly good match for Intelligence-based characters like alchemists, witches, and wizards.
