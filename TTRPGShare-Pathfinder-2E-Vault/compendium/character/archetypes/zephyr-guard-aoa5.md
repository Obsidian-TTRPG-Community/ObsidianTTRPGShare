- **Access**: You are from Katapesh.
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Zephyr Guard

As a Zephyr Guard, you're always vigilant against crime and threats to the city's safety. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks against attempts to [Palm an Object](../../../rules/actions/palm-an-object.md), [Steal](../../../rules/actions/steal.md), or [Conceal an Object](../../../rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) (including you're Seeking [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) objects). You become trained in [Society](../../../compendium/skills.md#Society) and [Katapesh Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Zephyr Guard archetype.

If you succeed, you size up their fighting style, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against that creature's attacks (or a +2 circumstance bonus for a critical success). These benefits last until the end of your next turn.
