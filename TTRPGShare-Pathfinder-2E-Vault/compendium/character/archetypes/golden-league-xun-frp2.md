# Golden League Xun Dedication  *Feat 8*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../../rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Underworld Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore)

You are a xun for the Golden League, aiding the organization.

You gain expert proficiency in two of the following skills (or in two other skills of your choice in which you're trained, if you were already an expert in the listed skills): [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics), [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth). In addition, if you use [Underworld Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore) to [Earn Income](../../../rules/actions/earn-income.md) or [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), when you get a success, you get a critical success instead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the Golden League Xun archetype.

Scaring off multiple people at once is your specialty. When you [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md), you can target up to 2 creatures within 30 feet of you at once. If you are a master of [Intimidation](../../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), you can [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) up to 4 creatures at once; if you're legendary, you can [Demoralize](../../../rules/actions/demoralize.md) up to 8 creatures at once.

# Rope Mastery  *Feat 10*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golden League Xun Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/golden-league-xun-dedication-frp2.md), expert in [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

Ropes are your tool of choice, and you deploy them in versatile ways. When Climbing a rope, you move 5 more feet on a success and 10 more feet on a critical success, to a maximum of your Speed. This additional movement stacks with the effects of [Quick Climb](../../../compendium/feats/quick-climb.md).

In addition, you can use a rope to hamper your foes. When holding a rope, you can attempt an [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](../../../rules/actions/disarm.md), [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md), or [Trip](../../../rules/actions/trip.md) a creature up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. If you critically fail such a check while holding a rope, you can drop the rope to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

# Silent Sting  [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[Archetype](../../../rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golden League Xun Dedication](../../../compendium/feats/golden-league-xun-dedication-frp2.md), expert in [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth)
- **Trigger** You make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with a weapon of light bulk.
- **Activity** Reaction

You quickly hide your weapon to make it difficult to pin the attack on you. You attempt to [Conceal an Object](../../../rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) to hide the triggering weapon. Your [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check is compared to the [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC of all creatures within 30 feet that can see you. You automatically succeed against creatures farther than 30 feet. The target of your [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) gains a +4 circumstance bonus to their [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC for this check. If your [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check is a success, you hide your weapon so well that the creature can't clearly determine where the attack originated.
