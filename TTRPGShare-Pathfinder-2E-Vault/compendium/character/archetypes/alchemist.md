# Alchemist *Dedication Level 2*  

You enjoy tinkering with alchemical formulas and substances in your spare time, and your studies have progressed beyond mere experimentation.

## Multiclass Alchemist characters
<sup>CRB p. 220</sup>

The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype are extremely useful to characters of any class. The following are just some of the possible combinations.

- Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their rage to ferocious effect.
- Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their champion's reaction and [lay on hands](../../spells/lay-on-hands.md) to go further.
- Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain additional options in situations where their usual tactics don't work.
- Ranger alchemists focus on alchemy and snares, getting extra use out of their [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) skill and supplying bombs for the bomb snare.
- Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue's poison feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an interesting way to sneak attack with various types of energy damage.
- Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew up [darkvision elixirs](../../equipment/items/darkvision-elixir.md) to grant [darkvision](../../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) can prepare another spell instead of [darkvision](../../spells/darkvision.md).
