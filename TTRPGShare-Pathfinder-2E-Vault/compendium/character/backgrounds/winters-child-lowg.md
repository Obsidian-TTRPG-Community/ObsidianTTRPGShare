# Winter's Child
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 118*  

Your or one of your ancestors hails from Irrisen, and some spark of the icy region's magic has manifested itself within your bones. The blood of Baba Yaga's legacy runs in your veins, and you are at one with the mysteries and dangers of the frozen land.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) skill and the [Weather Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Arcane Sense](../../feats/arcane-sense.md) skill feat.
