# Freed Slave Of Absalom
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 22*  

As a recently freed slave in Absalom, you belong to a new, closeknit social class at the heart of the city's most important trades.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../skills.md#Society) skill and the [Absalom Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Streetwise](../../feats/streetwise.md) skill feat.
