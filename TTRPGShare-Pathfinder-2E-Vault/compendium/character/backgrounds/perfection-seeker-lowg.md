# Perfection Seeker
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 82*  

You aspire to perfect your body and mind in the tradition of Jalmeray's Houses of Perfection, honing your acrobatic skills and mental faculties in preparation for a lifetime pushing the edge of what most consider possible.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) skill as well as the [Warfare Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Cat Fall](../../feats/cat-fall.md) skill feat.
