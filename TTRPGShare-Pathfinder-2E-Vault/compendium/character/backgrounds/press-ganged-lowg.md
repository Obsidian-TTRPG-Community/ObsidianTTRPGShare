# Press-ganged
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 70*  

You were forced into service as a sailor against your will.

Perhaps you were punished for a crime, were drafted into military service, are repaying a debt, or simply were abducted.

Though you were initially trained as a simple deckhand, you may have subsequently studied a trade under one of the vessel's specialists.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../skills.md#Society) skill and the [Sailing Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Experienced Professional](../../feats/experienced-professional.md) skill feat.
