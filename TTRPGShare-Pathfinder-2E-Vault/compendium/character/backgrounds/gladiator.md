# Gladiator
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 62*  

The bloody games of the arena taught you the art of combat.

Before you attained true fame, you departed—or escaped—the arena to explore the world. Your skill at drawing both blood and a crowd's attention pay off in a new adventuring life.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Performance](../../skills.md#Performance) skill and the [Gladiatorial Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Impressive Performance](../../feats/impressive-performance.md) skill feat.
