# Mana Wastes Refugee
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 82*  

Exposure to the corrupting influence of the Mana Wastes' strange energies has warped your inner essence, resulting in unpredictable interactions with magic items and more than a little know-how about surviving under bizarre and adverse natural conditions.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) skill and the [Wilderness Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Trick Magic Item](../../feats/trick-magic-item.md) skill feat.
