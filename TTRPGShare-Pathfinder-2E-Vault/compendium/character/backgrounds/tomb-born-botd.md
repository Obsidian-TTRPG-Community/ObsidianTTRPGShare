# Tomb Born
*Source: Book of the Dead p. 17*  

Your parents conceived you for a fell purpose at a site tainted by death, like a wight's barrow, mass grave, or ossuary. Their reasons could be a mystery, or you might know of their grand design and seek to escape—or fulfill—their plans. Either way, you're at your most dangerous when near death.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Undead Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the Final Spite reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Final Spite [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You're reduced to 0 Hit Points

**Effect** You make a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) before falling [unconscious](../../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).
```
