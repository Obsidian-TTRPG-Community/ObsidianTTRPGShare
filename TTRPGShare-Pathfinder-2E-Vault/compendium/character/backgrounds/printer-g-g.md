# Printer
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 45*  

Keeping your finger on the pulse of the city, you write a small news broadsheet to sell on street corners. You rent the use of a printing press to achieve this goal, so you're familiar with such machines. However, people and their stories are your main focus, and you adventure to chase the latest scoop.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../skills.md#Society) skill and the [Scribing Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Multilingual](../../feats/multilingual.md) skill feat.
