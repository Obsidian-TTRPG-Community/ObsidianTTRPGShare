# Charlatan
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 61*  

You traveled from place to place, peddling false fortunes and snake oil in one town, pretending to be royalty in exile to seduce a wealthy heir in the next. Becoming an adventurer might be your next big scam or an attempt to put your talents to use for a greater cause. Perhaps it's a bit of both, as you realize that after pretending to be a hero, you've become the mask.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) skill and the [Underworld Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Charming Liar](../../feats/charming-liar.md) skill feat.
