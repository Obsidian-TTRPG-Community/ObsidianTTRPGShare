# Grave Robber
*Source: Book of the Dead p. 16*  

Resurrectionist. Body snatcher. No matter what you're called, you know where the bodies are buried, and how many coins they'll fetch when dug up. Adventuring comes naturally to you—in your mind dungeons are just oversized tombs—as does returning home with your loot [undetected](../../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected).

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) skill and the [Underworld Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Experienced Smuggler](../../feats/experienced-smuggler.md) skill feat.
