# Acrobat
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 60*  

In a circus or on the streets, you earned your pay by performing as an acrobat. You might have turned to adventuring when the money dried up, or simply decided to put your skills to better use.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) skill and the [Circus Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Steady Balance](../../feats/steady-balance.md) skill feat.
