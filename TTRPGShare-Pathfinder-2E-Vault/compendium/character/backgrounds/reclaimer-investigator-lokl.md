# Reclaimer Investigator
*Source: Lost Omens: Knights of Lastwall p. 73*  

You believe the mysterious patron of the Crimson Reclaimers has an ulterior motive that bedevils the Knights of Lastwall.

Whatever the organization gains from the pact, some mysterious force with its own agenda and a need for anonymity benefits as well. You've made it your mission to determine what that agenda is before the patron decides it has manipulated from the shadows long enough.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) skill and the [Crimson Reclaimers Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Oddity Identification](../../feats/oddity-identification.md) skill feat.
