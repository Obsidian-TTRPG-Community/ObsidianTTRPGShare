# Oenopion Ooze-tender
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 82*  

Your apprenticeship in one of Oenopion's unorthodox arcane and alchemical academies instilled in you a deep reservoir of mostly reliable esoteric knowledge, not to mention a deep resentment born of countless hours spent mucking ooze pens and feeding helpless creatures to ravenous, belching jellies and gelatinous puddings.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Ooze Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Dubious Knowledge](../../feats/dubious-knowledge.md) skill feat.
