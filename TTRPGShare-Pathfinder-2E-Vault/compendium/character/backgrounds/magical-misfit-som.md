# Magical Misfit
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 29*  

You don't understand folks who claim that magical talent is some sort of burden or great responsibility; you've always used your magic to cause trouble and to escape the consequences. Whether becoming an adventurer is your attempt to make amends or just a new way to make some mischief, you're excited to see where it takes you, and you still delight in using your skills to get out of trouble.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) and [Underworld Lore](../../skills.md#Lore). You gain the [Trick Magic Item](../../feats/trick-magic-item.md) skill feat.
