# Wished Alive
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 47*  

Once you were a simple construct or inanimate doll, but due to a deeply felt wish, either yours or another's, you came to life, and so you're now a living, breathing creature.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) skill. Once per day, you can fervently wish for something you could work towards achieving as a single action which has the [concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the first skill check you attempt before the end of your turn to fulfill that wish.
