# Local Scion
*Source: Age of Ashes Player's Guide p. 5*  

You're from Breachill and have lived there most, if not all, of your life. You might be the son or daughter of a wellknown local adventuring family, or a family with a storied tradition of military or other martial service. You likely also have some sort of skill with your hands, as the people of Breachill are very self-sufficient.

The Call for Heroes is one of your hometown's most iconic traditions, and you want to attend so you can prove your own merits to the council—beyond simply those of your family's name.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Breachill Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](../../feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat.
