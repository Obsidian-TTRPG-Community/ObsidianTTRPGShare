# Shory Seeker
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 94*  

You've dedicated your life to unraveling the secrets of the ancient Shory Empire, either through meticulous research or by traveling into dangerous and distant ruins to track down longlost artifacts.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Shory Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](../../feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat.
