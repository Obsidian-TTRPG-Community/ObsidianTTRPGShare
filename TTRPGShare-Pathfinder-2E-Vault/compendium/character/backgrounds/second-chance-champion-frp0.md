# Second Chance Champion
*Source: Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Player's Guide p. 7*  

You competed in the last Ruby Phoenix Tournament 10 years ago, though you didn't make it to the end. One wrong step, one mistimed punch, one blocked spell—whatever it was, that was all it took for your opponent to get the upper hand and knock you out of the tournament. Well, maybe it was a simple mistake or maybe you just weren't up to snuff, and you're too headstrong to admit it.

Now, after training for a decade to ensure you don't repeat any of your prior mistakes, you've joined forces with a team of fellow fighters in order to maximize your odds of making it all the way to the finals. Whatever happened before, you've vowed to return to the ring in Goka for an epic rematch, and this time you're not walking out until you've been named Ruby Phoenix Champion.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Strength, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) and the [Gladiatorial Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Cat Fall](../../feats/cat-fall.md) skill feat.
