# Martial Disciple
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 63*  

You dedicated yourself to intense training and rigorous study to become a great warrior. The school you attended might have been a traditionalist monastery, an elite military academy, or the local branch of a prestigious mercenary organization.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of the [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) skill. You gain a skill feat: [Cat Fall](../../feats/cat-fall.md) if you chose [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Quick Jump](../../feats/quick-jump.md) if you chose [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics). You're also trained in the [Warfare Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.
