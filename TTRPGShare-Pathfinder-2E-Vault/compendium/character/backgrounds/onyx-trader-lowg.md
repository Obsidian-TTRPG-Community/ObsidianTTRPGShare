# Onyx Trader
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 46*  

Oprak doesn't share the secrets of the Onyx Vault with many, but you are one of the lucky few to be permitted into the heart of the nation. You have traveled the extradimensional paths of the Stone Roads and traded goods across a wide variety of lands. You've learned to step lively in foreign markets of all types.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../skills.md#Society) skill and the [Mercantile Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Multilingual](../../feats/multilingual.md) skill feat.
