# Nexian Mystic
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 82*  

Your initiations into the Nexian mysteries and the philosophies of the Arclords of Nex grant you a preternatural comprehension of the arcane underpinnings of existence.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) skill and a [Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill related to one plane of your choice (other than the Material Plane). You gain the [Arcane Sense](../../feats/arcane-sense.md) skill feat.
