# Tinker
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 64*  

Creating all sorts of minor inventions scratches your itch for problem-solving. Your engineering skills take a particularly creative bent, and no one know what you'll come up with next.

It might be a genius device with tremendous potential... or it might explode.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Engineering Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](../../feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat.
