# Ratted-Out Gun Runner
*Source: Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide p. 12*  

Sure, you've got a checkered past. Who doesn't? It's hard to make a living in the City of Smog, so you did what you could to put silvers in your pocket and food on the table. You made a good deal of money selling firearms from the Gunworks to people who perhaps shouldn't have had them. You even worked with wasteland marauders a few times, sticking up Ustradi barges plying the river between the Gunworks and Alkenstar. Of course, you never hurt any innocents or did anything truly heinous; your criminal career was always just a matter of money.

One day, a corrupt financier named Ambrost Mugland—a true crook if there ever was one—approached you, demanding a cut of your business. When you refused, he put in a word with the shieldmarshals that you'd be a certain somewhere at a certain time with a certain large quantity of illegally obtained firearms.

Even though you escaped arrest, your identity was compromised, and your old accomplices have all turned their backs on you. Your gun-running days are clearly over. Now, you're just running.
