# Junker
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 45*  

You live on the outskirts of civilization, combing through the detritus left behind for interesting trinkets to sell or use in your own crafting. Though you have a preferred terrain to search, you know that the greatest treasures occur where people make greater use of technology.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill of the terrain in which you scavenge. You gain the [Hefty Hauler](../../feats/hefty-hauler.md) skill feat.
