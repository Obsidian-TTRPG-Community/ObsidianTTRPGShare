# Sodden Scavenger
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 94*  

You've managed to eke out an existence in the storm-wracked Sodden Lands and have become an expert at scavenging food and tools.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Swamp Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Forager](../../feats/forager.md) skill feat.
