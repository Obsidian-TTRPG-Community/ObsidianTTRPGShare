# Warrior
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 64*  

In your younger days, you waded into battle as a mercenary, a warrior defending a nomadic people, or a member of a militia or army. You might have wanted to break out from the regimented structure of these forces, or you could have always been as independent a warrior as you are now.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation) skill and the [Warfare Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Intimidating Glare](../../feats/intimidating-glare.md) skill feat.
