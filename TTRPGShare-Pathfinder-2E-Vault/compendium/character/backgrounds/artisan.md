# Artisan
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 60*  

As an apprentice, you practiced a particular form of building or crafting, developing specialized skill. You might have been a blacksmith's apprentice toiling over the forge for countless hours, a young tailor sewing garments of all kinds, or a shipwright shaping the hulls of ships.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Guild Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Specialty Crafting](../../feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat.
