# Toymaker
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 45*  

You delight in making little trinkets for children of all ages, and seeing their faces light up thanks to one of your creations brings joy to your heart. Perhaps you sell your wares from a particular shop or from the back of a wagon as you travel from town to town.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Mercantile Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](../../feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat, choosing artistry, blacksmithing, glassmaking, leatherworking, tailoring, or woodworking as your specialty.

While most backgrounds are available to any character, some backgrounds are so unusual that just having them makes a character rare and extraordinary.

These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly different roleplaying experience by setting their character up with a history or legacy beyond the norm. For example, when a character with the discarded duplicate background is the duplicate of a world-shaking or plot-essential NPC, the character is situated in a special position within the narrative. Your character's background is an intrinsic part of where they come from and not something they earn during the game. Rare backgrounds should be chosen only after a discussion between the GM and other players as to whether one would apply for a particular character in your group's game.
