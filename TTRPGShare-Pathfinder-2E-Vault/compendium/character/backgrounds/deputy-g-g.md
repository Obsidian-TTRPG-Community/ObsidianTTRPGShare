# Deputy
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 122*  

While your life may have taken some twists and turns in the intervening years, you were once deputized as the lawful protector of a community. While the role was temporary and you've since turned in your badge, that responsibility shaped you. Whenever a community is in trouble, and the sheriff is nowhere to be found, residents call on you to capture a criminal, rescue the mayor's offspring from bandits, or go toe to toe with outlaws.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Hunting Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Experienced Tracker](../../feats/experienced-tracker.md) skill feat.
