# Mammoth Speaker
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 118*  

You have learned the secrets of taming the mighty mammoths and other megafauna of the far north. Perhaps these talents are a part of your people's traditional customs, or perhaps you sought out these massive animals of your own accord.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) skill and the [Animal Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Train Animal](../../feats/train-animal.md) skill feat.
