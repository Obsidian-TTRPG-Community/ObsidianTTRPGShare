# Trailblazer
*Source: Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide p. 8*  

Uncharted realms have always intrigued you, and you've explored and mapped large territories in service to merchants, governments, or your own curiosity. Where some see a blank spot on a map, you see the potential for something new and undiscovered.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Cartography Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Terrain Expertise](../../feats/terrain-expertise.md) skill feat with one terrain you've explored (such as forest or underground).
