# Child Of The Puddles
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 22*  

You grew up in the soggy, squalid quarter of Absalom known as the Puddles. You're at home in tightly packed urban environments.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) skill and the [Absalom Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Steady Balance](../../feats/steady-balance.md) skill feat.
