# Sheriff
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 124*  

You hold an official title of sheriff or deputy in a small community. Those that would do harm to others flee your gaze, for they know it brings the promise of castigation.

You protect your town, watch over those who have placed their trust in you, and make sure those that would do others harm are brought to justice.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation) skill and the [Hunting Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Group Coercion](../../feats/group-coercion.md) skill feat.
