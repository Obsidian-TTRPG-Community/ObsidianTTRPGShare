# Market Runner
*Source: Abomination Vaults Player's Guide p. 4*  

Keeleno Lathenar, the proprietor of Otari Market, is a grim and bitter man. A werewolf named Jaul Mezmin mauled his wife, Ayla, to death 30 years ago. Keeleno has never forgotten nor forgiven this attack, and he believes against all odds that Jaul has evaded justice and is alive and well. Running errands for Keeleno around town, you've gotten to know him almost as well as you know Otari. Keeleno's suspicions have rubbed off on you a bit, so you keep a wary eye on other people— particularly around the full moon.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) skill and the [Otari Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Hobnobber](../../feats/hobnobber.md) skill feat.
