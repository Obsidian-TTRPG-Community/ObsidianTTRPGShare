# Storm Survivor
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 70*  

Through luck or through skill, you managed to survive a catastrophic maritime disaster, such as a shipwreck or being thrown overboard. You have a keen sense for weather or situations that are similar to the one you escaped.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Weather Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Forager](../../feats/forager.md) skill feat.
