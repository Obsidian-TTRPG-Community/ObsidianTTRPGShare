# Hounded Thief
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 45*  

Some time ago, you stole a unique item from a strange individual. It might have been a piece of clockwork from a far-off land or some other bit of strange technology. You might still have it or you might have sold it, but either way, you can't shake the feeling that you're being followed and watched, likely by forces who want to retrieve what you took. Luckily, a life of adventure keeps you on the move.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) skill and the [Underworld Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Pickpocket](../../feats/pickpocket.md) skill feat.
