# Alkenstar Sojourner
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 124*  

You came to Alkenstar because you heard they had guns, but you stayed because of the atmosphere. Or the guns.

Either way, journalism and scientific curiosity opened the door to a life of adventure. Now you continue to adventure in the Alkenstar area, using your skills to deal with whatever situations present themselves.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Society](../../skills.md#Society) and [Engineering Lore](../../skills.md#Lore). You gain the [Streetwise](../../feats/streetwise.md) skill feat.
