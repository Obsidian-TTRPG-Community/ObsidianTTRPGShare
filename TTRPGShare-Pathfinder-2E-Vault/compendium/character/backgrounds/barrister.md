# Barrister
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 60*  

Piles of legal manuals, stern teachers, and experience in the courtroom have instructed you in legal matters. You're capable of mounting a prosecution or defense in court, and you tend to keep abreast of local laws, as you never can tell when you might need to know them on short notice.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) skill and the [Legal Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Group Impression](../../feats/group-impression.md) skill feat.
