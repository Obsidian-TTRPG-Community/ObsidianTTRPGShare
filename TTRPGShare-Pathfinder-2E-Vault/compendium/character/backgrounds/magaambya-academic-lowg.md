*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 94*  

You studied magic at the prestigious Magaambya academy in Nantambu, learning magical traditions dating back to Old-Mage Jatembe and earning a pedigree respected by magical scholars almost everywhere.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of either the [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) skill, as well as the [Academia Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Recognize Spell](../../feats/recognize-spell.md) skill feat.
