# Flame Wisp *Spell 2*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Three faintly glowing wisps of fire float around your head.

Each time you hit a creature with a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), one of the wisps goes hurtling towards that creature, dealing `1d4` fire damage. If you [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with the [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md) trait while you have fewer than three wisps, a new wisp appears.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d4`.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
