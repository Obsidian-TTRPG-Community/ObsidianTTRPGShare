You shroud the target in a powerful predatory aura and amplify its vocalizations. It gains a +1 status bonus to [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) checks. Once during this spell's duration, it can take the Thundering Roar action.

Thundering Roar [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") (auditory, concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, flourish, mental, sonic) The target unleashes a powerful vocalization. Each enemy in a 10-foot emanation takes `4d8` sonic damage with a basic Will save against your spell DC. A creature that fails its Will save is also [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The status bonus to [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) checks increases by 1 (to a maximum of a +4 status bonus for an 8th-level spell), and the damage from the roar increases by `2d8`.
