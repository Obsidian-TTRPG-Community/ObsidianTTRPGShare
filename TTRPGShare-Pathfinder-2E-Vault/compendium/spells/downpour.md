You call forth a torrential downpour, which extinguishes nonmagical flames. Creatures in the area are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) and gain fire resistance 10. Creatures outside the area are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to those inside the area. Creatures with weakness to water that end their turns in the area take damage equal to their weakness.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The fire resistance increases by 2.
