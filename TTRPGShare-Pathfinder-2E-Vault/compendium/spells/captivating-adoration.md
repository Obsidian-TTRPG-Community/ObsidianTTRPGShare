- **Area**15-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

You become intensely entrancing, and creatures are distracted by you as long as they remain within the area. You can exclude any creatures you choose from the effects.

When a creature enters the area for the first time, it must attempt a Will saving throw. If a creature leaves and reenters, it uses the results of its original save.

> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) with you, and its attitude toward you improves by one step.
