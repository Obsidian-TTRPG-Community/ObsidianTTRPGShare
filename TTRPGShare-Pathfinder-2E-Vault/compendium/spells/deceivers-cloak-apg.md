You wrap yourself in a cloak of illusion, appearing as another creature of the same body shape with roughly similar height and weight as yourself. This has the effects of a 3rd-level [illusory disguise](illusory-disguise.md).

**Heightened (6th)** You can appear as any creature of the same size, even with a completely different body shape.
