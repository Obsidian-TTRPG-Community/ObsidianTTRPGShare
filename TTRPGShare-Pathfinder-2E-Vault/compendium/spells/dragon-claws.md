Vicious claws grow from your fingers. They are finesse unarmed attacks that deal `1d4` slashing damage and `1d6` extra damage of a type determined by the dragon in your bloodline (see the table in dragon breath). Your scales from blood magic glow with faint energy, giving you resistance 5 to the same damage type.

**Heightened (5th)** The extra damage increases to `2d6`, and the resistance increases to 10.

**Heightened (9th)** The extra damage increases to `3d6`, and the resistance increases to 15.
