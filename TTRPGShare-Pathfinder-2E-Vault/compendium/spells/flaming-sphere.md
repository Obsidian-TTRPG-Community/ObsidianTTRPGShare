You create a sphere of flame in a square within range. The sphere must be supported by a solid surface, such as a stone floor. The sphere deals `3d6` fire damage to each creature in the square where it first appears; each creature must attempt a basic Reflex save. On subsequent rounds, the first time you [Sustain this Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) each round, you can leave the sphere in its square or roll it to another square within range. It deals `3d6` fire damage (basic Reflex save) to each creature in that square.

Creatures that succeed at their save take no damage (instead of half).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
