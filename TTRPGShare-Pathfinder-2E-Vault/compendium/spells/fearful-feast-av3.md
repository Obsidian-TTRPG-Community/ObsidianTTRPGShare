# Fearful Feast *Focus 4*   
[fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A creature within range becomes [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**the triggering creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You open your mouth wide and inhale sharply; you draw in the bravery, self-confidence, and hope to which the [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) target clings and then strip away the target's false assumption that these fragile emotions can save them from the oblivion of terror.

You deal `6d4` mental damage to the creature, which must attempt a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature's [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition increases by 1, and it takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature's [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition increases by 2, and it takes full damage; you regain Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature's [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition increases by 3 and it takes double damage; you regain Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d4`.
