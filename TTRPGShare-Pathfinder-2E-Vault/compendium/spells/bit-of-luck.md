# Bit Of Luck *Focus 1*   
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[luck](../setting/domains.md#Luck)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 willing creature
- **Duration**1 minute

You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends.

If you cast [bit of luck]() again, any previous bit of luck you cast that's still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted with bit of luck, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
