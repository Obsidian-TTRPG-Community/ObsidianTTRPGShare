[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [force](../../rules/traits/force.md)  [monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot cone or more
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You unleash your ki as a powerful blast of force that deals `2d6` force damage. If you use 2 actions to cast [ki blast](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/ki-blast.md), increase the size of the cone to 30 feet and the damage to `3d6`. If you use 3 actions to cast [ki blast](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/ki-blast.md), increase the size of the cone to 60 feet and the damage to `4d6`. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed 5 feet.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is pushed 10 feet.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`, or by `2d6` if you use 2 or 3 actions.
