# Mind Probe *Spell 5*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You cast your thoughts through a creature's mind, sifting for information. You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** Each round of the spell's duration, you can [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) to ask a different question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe is truthful Once you've asked the target a given question, asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe, produces the same result.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target takes a –4 circumstance penalty to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks against your questions.
