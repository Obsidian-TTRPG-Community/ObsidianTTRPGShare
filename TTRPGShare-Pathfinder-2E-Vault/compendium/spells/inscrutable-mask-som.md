- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**10 minutes

You shroud your form and features in an impenetrable mask of shadow. The mask grants you a +1 status bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) or [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md), [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](../../rules/actions/demoralize.md), and [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) in areas of dim light or darkness.

**Heightened (6th)** The status bonus increases to +2.

**Heightened (9th)** The status bonus increases to +3. Shadow Companions Spellcasters aren't the sole purveyors of shadow magic. Some adventurers are guided on their path by companions with an inherent connection to shadow, whether or not the adventurer is a shadowcaster. Adventurers who would wield shadow should follow the guidance of such beings. Shadowcasters, as well as others who might stumble across this knowledge, have access to the shadow hound animal companion and the shade specialization option.
