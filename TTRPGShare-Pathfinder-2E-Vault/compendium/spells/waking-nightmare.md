You fill the creature's mind with a terrifying vision out of its nightmares. The target must attempt a Will save.

If the target is [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) when you [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) on it, it immediately wakes up before attempting its save, and if it fails its save, it gains the [fleeing](../../rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) condition for 1 round in addition to the effects noted above.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
