# Unbreaking Wave Advance *Focus 3*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [water](../../rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**15-foot cone
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You unleash a mighty wave from your hand that buffets back your foes. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If a creature pushed by unbreaking wave advance would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes `3d6` damage.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage for pushing a creature into a solid barrier increases by `1d6`.
