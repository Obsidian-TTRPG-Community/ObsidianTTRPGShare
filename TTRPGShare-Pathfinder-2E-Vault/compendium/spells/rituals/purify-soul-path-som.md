# Purify Soul Path *Ritual 2*  
[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** 1 day
- **Cost** rare incense and offering worth a total value of 10 gp × your level
- **Primary Checks** [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (trained)

You delve inward, spending extensive time contemplating the purity of your own soul and the actions of your past. If you aren't truly penitent, the outcome is always a critical failure.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You reconcile your misdeeds with your soul path, removing your soulforged corruption. The corruption flaw from your armament no longer affects you. Before your reconciliation is complete, you must perform a special quest or other task in accord with your soul path. If completed during downtime, this task should take no less than 1 week. For 1 month, you receive divine insight just before performing an act that would be anathema to your soul path.
> - **Success** As critical success, but you gain no special insight regarding its subsequent actions.
> - **Failure** You don't reconcile and must continue to meditate and redress your misdeeds. Any future purify soul path rituals for the same misdeeds cost half as much and gain a +4 circumstance bonus to the primary check.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the maximum target level by 2 and the base cost by 10 gp.
