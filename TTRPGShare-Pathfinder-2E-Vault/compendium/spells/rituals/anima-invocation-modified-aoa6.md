# Anima Invocation (Modified) *Ritual 10*  
[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Cast** 1 hour
- **Secondary Casters** 4
- **Primary Checks** [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (legendary)

The exact effects of the unmodified Anima Invocation are not necessary for this Adventure Path—what's presented here is the modified version of the ritual.

When casting the modified version of the Anima Invocation, it instead draws upon the latent spiritual energies of sapient creatures within range of the spell without requiring their deaths, then uses this energy to bolster the connection between body and soul among all of the ritual's casters. This shift from an offensive effect to a defensive one results in a much less dangerous spell that helps to protect against [Dahak](../../setting/deities/dahak-logm.md).
