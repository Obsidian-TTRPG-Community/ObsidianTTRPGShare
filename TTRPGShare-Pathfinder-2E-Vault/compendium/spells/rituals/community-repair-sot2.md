- **Secondary Casters** 4 or more
- **Primary Checks** [Performance](../../skills.md#Performance) (expert)
- **Secondary Checks** [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting), [Performance](../../skills.md#Performance), [Society](../../skills.md#Society)

You lead your community in repairing a public work, such as a bridge, well, or mural, through the power of memory and art. The primary caster serves as an emcee or leader, while each secondary caster provides a heartfelt anecdote that somehow involves the public work; for instance, recounting a story of playing at a fountain each summer. The anecdotes don't need to be firsthand accounts—a community member might sing of how their grandparents fell in love crossing a bridge every day—but they must be directly connected in some way. The GM can offer a +1 circumstance bonus to the secondary caster whose anecdote seems most moving.

If the public work was destroyed intentionally by one of the casters, the ritual automatically critically fails.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The public work is restored to its prior construction, and it takes on further qualities, encouraged by the thoughts of the community. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they receive a +1 status bonus to Will saves against [emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effects and a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds.
> - **Success** The public work is restored to its prior construction and function.
> - **Failure** The ritual has no effect.
> - **Critical Failure** The public work refuses to repair itself, and the memories of the community members are soured in response to the botched ritual. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they cannot receive any benefit from beneficial [emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effects, and they take a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds as their movement slows to a morose crawl.
