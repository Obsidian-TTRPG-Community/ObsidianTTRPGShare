# Arcane Weaving *Ritual 3*  
[divination](../../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** 1 day
- **Cost** rare silks worth a total value of 20 gp × the spell level
- **Secondary Casters** 1
- **Primary Checks** [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) or [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (expert)
- **Secondary Checks** [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana), [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting), or [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism)

You and the secondary casters weave together spells (and, if anadis, silk) in a complex ritual that combines magical learning with art, allowing all the participants to share spells they know with one another.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You or any secondary caster can swap any spell in your spell repertoire for a spell in the spell repertoire of any other participant. This spell can't be a higher level than the ritual's level.
> - **Failure** None of the participants can swap spells.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and all participants are [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 24 hours and can't reduce their [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition below 1 for 24 hours.
