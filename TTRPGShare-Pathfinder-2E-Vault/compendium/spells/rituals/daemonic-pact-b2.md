# Daemonic Pact *Ritual 1*  
[conjuration](../../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** 1 day
- **Primary Checks** [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (expert; you must be a demon or urdefhan)

You call upon the powers of Abaddon to grant you the assistance of a daemon. You call upon a daemon whose level can be no more than double _daemonic pact's_ spell level, two daemons whose levels are each at least 2 less than double the spell level, or three daemons whose levels are each at least 3 less than double the spell level.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You conjure the daemon or daemons, and they require nothing in return for their service.
> - **Success** You conjure the daemon or daemons, who serve you willingly, but require a sacrifice in the form of spilled blood (either another creature's or your own).
> - **Failure** You don't conjure any daemons.
> - **Critical Failure** You don't conjure any daemons, and the self-sacrifice required to perform the ritual leaves you [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) (or [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) if the spell level is 5 or higher).
