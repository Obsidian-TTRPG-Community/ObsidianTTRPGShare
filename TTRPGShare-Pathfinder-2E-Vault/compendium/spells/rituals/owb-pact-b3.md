# Owb Pact *Ritual 3*  
[conjuration](../../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** 1 day
- **Secondary Casters** 2
- **Primary Checks** [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (expert)

You call upon an owb to assist you in a goal. Only caligni callers can use this ritual with relative safety. If a different type of caligni attempts this ritual, they use an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their check. If a non-caligni attempts this ritual, the result is an automatic critical failure.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You conjure the owb. It decides your goals closely match its own and doesn't request a favor in return.
> - **Success** You conjure the owb. It isn't eager to pursue the task, so it requires a favor in return.
> - **Failure** You don't conjure an owb.
> - **Critical Failure** You conjure an owb, but it deems you unworthy and siphons away some of your soul energy. All casters become [doomed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed).
