# Stormwind Flight *Focus 4*   
[air](../../rules/traits/air.md)  [druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Powerful winds carry you smoothly through the air, giving you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as feather fall.

**Heightened (6th)** When you fly using stormwind flight, you don't count flying against the wind as difficult terrain.
