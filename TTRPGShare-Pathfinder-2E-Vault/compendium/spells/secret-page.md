You change the target's text to different text entirely. If the text is a spellbook or a scroll, you can change it to show a spell you know of secret page's level or lower. The replacement spell cannot be cast or used to prepare a spell. You can also transform the text into some other text you have written or have access to. You can specify a password that allows a creature touching the page to change the text back and forth. You must choose the replacement text and the password, if any, when you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).
