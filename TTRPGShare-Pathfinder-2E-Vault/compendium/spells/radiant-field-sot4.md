# Radiant Field *Spell 2*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [light](../../rules/traits/light.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You create an area of bright light. Creatures with light blindness (Bestiary 343) that are [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by radiant field and remain in the area must attempt a Fortitude save at the start of their turns. On a failure, a creature remains [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round; this is an [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect. This spell also suppresses magical darkness of your radiant field spell's level or lower.

**Heightened (4th)** Creatures seen through the area are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures with light blindness, even those that are outside the area.
