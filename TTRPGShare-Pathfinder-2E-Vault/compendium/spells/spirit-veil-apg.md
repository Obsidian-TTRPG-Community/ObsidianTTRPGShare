# Spirit Veil *Focus 3*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You draw an occluding veil of spirits around yourself, blocking yourself especially well from undead eyes. You become [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to all creatures, and you are [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from undead creatures regardless of what precise senses they have; this grants the effects of invisibility, but against all the undead creature's precise senses. If you physically interact with an undead creature or use a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, the spell ends.

**Heightened (+ 1)** You can target one additional willing creature within 30 feet. The spell ends if any target physically interacts with an undead creature or uses a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action.
