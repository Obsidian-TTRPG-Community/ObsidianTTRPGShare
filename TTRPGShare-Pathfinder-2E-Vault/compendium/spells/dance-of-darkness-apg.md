# Dance Of Darkness *Focus 5*   
[darkness](../../rules/traits/darkness.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**varies

You dance, [Striding](../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to half your Speed. At either the start or end of your [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), you create an area of magical darkness in a 10-foot burst centered on your location. This area is filled with magical darkness that works the same way as that created by a [darkness](darkness.md) spell of the same level. When you create the darkness, attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check to dance, with a standard DC for your level, to determine the duration of the darkness.
