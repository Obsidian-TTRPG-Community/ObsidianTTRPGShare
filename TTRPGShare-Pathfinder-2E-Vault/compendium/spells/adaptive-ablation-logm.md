You shift yourself to adapt to the mystical wavelengths of the energy damage, protecting yourself from further harm. You gain resistance 5 to the triggering energy type; you gain this resistance after you take the triggering damage, so it applies only to future damage you take during the duration.

**Heightened (+ 2)** Increase the resistance by 5.
