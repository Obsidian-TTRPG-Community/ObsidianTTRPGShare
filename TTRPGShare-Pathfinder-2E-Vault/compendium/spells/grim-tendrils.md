# Grim Tendrils *Spell 1*   
[necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot line
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

Tendrils of darkness curl out from your fingertips and race through the air. You deal `2d4` negative damage and 1 [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to living creatures in the line. Each living creature in the line must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half the negative damage and no [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double negative damage and double [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The negative damage increases by `2d4`, and the [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1.
