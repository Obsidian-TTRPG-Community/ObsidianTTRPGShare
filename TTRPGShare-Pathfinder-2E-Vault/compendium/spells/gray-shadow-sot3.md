# Gray Shadow *Spell 6*   
[necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [shadow](../../rules/traits/shadow.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature
- **Duration**sustained

You pray over a [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature, drawing its shadow into your service as long as its owner is stooped at death's door. You summon a greater shadow in a space adjacent to the [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature. The greater shadow has its usual stats (Pathfinder Bestiary 289), with the following modifications:

- The greater shadow's shadow hand [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d8` poison damage.
- When you [Cast a Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can use the greater shadow's location as the origin point instead of your own location. Upon doing so, the greater shadow immediately disappears. If the [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature targeted by this spell dies or regains consciousness, the greater shadow disappears and this spell ends.
