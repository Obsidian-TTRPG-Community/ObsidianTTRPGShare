# Tangling Creepers *Spell 6*   
[conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [plant](../../rules/traits/plant.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Area**40-foot burst
- **Duration**10 minutes

Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. This vine has a 15-foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target. If the attack succeeds, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it [immobilized](../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round or until the creature [Escapes](../../rules/actions/escape.md) (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.
