# Dust Storm *Focus 4*   
[air](../../rules/traits/air.md)  [conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [nonlethal](../../rules/traits/nonlethal.md)  

- **Domains**: [[dust](../setting/domains.md#Dust)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot-radius burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You call forth a swirling storm of dust. The dust storm obscures vision, with the effect of obscuring mist. The dust also makes the air unbreathable; creatures in the area must hold their breath (Core Rulebook 478), though wearing a scarf or similar clothing over the mouth increases the time the creature can hold its breath to 5 rounds. Creatures entering or starting their turn in the dust storm take `1d6` slashing damage. Creatures that have the [water](../../rules/traits/water.md) trait or that are made primarily of liquid take double damage.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
