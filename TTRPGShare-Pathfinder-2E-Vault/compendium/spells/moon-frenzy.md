# Moon Frenzy *Spell 5*   
[morph](../../rules/traits/morph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**up to 5 willing creatures
- **Duration**1 minute

A feral aspect overcomes the targets, making them tough and savage. Targets gain 5 temporary Hit Points, a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds, and weakness 5 to silver. They also grow vicious fangs and claws, which are unarmed attacks. The fangs deal `2d8` piercing damage; the claws deal `2d6` slashing damage and have the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) and [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md) traits. The targets use their highest weapon or unarmed attack proficiency with these attacks, and if they have weapon specialization or greater weapon specialization, they add this damage as well. On a critical hit with one of these unarmed attacks, the creature struck takes `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

The targets can't use concentrate actions unless those actions also have the [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md) trait, with the exception of [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md). A creature can attempt to end the spell's effect on itself by using a single action, which has the [rage](../../rules/traits/rage.md) trait, to attempt a Will save against your spell DC; on a success, it ends the spell's effect on itself.

If a target is in the light of a full moon, it also grows by one size if it were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.

**Heightened (6th)** The temporary Hit Points increase to 10, the silver weakness to 10, and the damage dealt by the attacks to three dice.

**Heightened (10th)** The temporary Hit Points increase to 20, the silver weakness to 20, and the damage dealt by the attacks to four dice.
