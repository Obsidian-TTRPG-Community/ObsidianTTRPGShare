- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 ally
- **Duration**1 round

Your encouragement inspires your ally to succeed at a task.

This counts as having taken sufficient preparatory actions to [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) your ally on a skill check of your choice, regardless of the circumstances. When you later use the [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) reaction, you can roll [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) instead of the normal skill check, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead. If you are legendary in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance), you automatically critically succeed.

The GM might rule that you can't use this ability if the act of encouraging your ally would interfere with the skill check (such as a check to [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md) quietly or maintain a disguise).
