# Darkness *Spell 2*   
[darkness](../../rules/traits/darkness.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You create a shroud of darkness that prevents light from penetrating or emanating within the area. Light does not enter the area and any non-magical light sources, such as a torch or lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area, even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness.

This also suppresses magical light of your [darkness](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/darkness.md) spell's level or lower. Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness.

**Heightened (4th)** Even creatures with [darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) (but not [greater darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md)) can barely see through the darkness. They treat targets seen through the darkness as [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed).
