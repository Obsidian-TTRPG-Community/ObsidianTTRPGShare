# Loose Time's Arrow *Spell 2*   
[transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**up to 6 creatures
- **Duration**until the start of your next turn

You pluck the time stream like a bow—pull one string back, release, and watch a creature fly. All affected targets are [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened). They can use the extra action only to [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) or [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md).
