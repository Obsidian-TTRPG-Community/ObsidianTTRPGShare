You wrap the targeted creatures in thin, sickly green shrouds that sap information from attackers. The shroud settles about each target's shoulders, granting a +1 status bonus to AC and a +2 status bonus to [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks, both only while the target is in dim light or darkness.

If a creature deals damage in melee to or touches a cloaked creature, the cloak wraps around the attacker, temporarily connecting the psyches of the cloaked creature and the attacker and violently prying a random piece of interesting information from the attacker's mind. The attacker takes `2d8` mental damage and must attempt a Will save. Afterward, the spell ends for the cloaked creature, and the attacker is temporarily immune to mirecloak for 24 hours.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The attacker is unaffected.
> - **Success** The attacker takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The attacker takes full damage and is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened). In addition, the cloaked creature gleans a piece of information from the attacker's mind.
>
>    The details and extent of this information are at the GM's discretion.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the attacker takes double damage and is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
