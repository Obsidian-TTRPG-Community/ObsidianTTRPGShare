# Boost Eidolon *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [summoner](../../rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**100 foot
- **Targets**your eidolon
- **Duration**1 round

You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and boost the power of your eidolon's attacks. Your eidolon gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with its unarmed attacks. If your eidolon's [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deal more than one weapon damage die, the status bonus increases to 2 per weapon damage die, to a maximum of +8 with four weapon damage dice.
