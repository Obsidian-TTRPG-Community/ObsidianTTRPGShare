# Extend Boost *Focus 1*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [summoner](../../rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 

You focus on the intricacies of the magic binding you to your eidolon to extend the duration of your [boost eidolon](boost-eidolon-som.md) or [reinforce eidolon](reinforce-eidolon-som.md) spell. If your next action is to cast [boost eidolon](boost-eidolon-som.md) or reinforce eidolon, attempt a skill check with the skill associated with the tradition of magic you gain from your eidolon (such as [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) for a primal eidolon). The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
