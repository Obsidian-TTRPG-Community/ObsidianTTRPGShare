# Alter Reality *Spell 10*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:

- Duplicate any spell from the occult list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be [common](../../rules/traits/common.md) or you must have access.
- Produce any effect whose power is equivalent to any occult spell 9th level or lower, or non-occult spell 7th level or lower.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the [wish](wish.md) spell.

At the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.
