[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [hex](../../rules/traits/hex-apg.md)  [shadow](../../rules/traits/shadow.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [witch](../../rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You reshape the target's shadow into a deadly form, such as strangling hands, a dangerous weapon, harrying runes, or the like, and command it to attack the target. When you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), and each time you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), the shadow makes a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against the target. The shadow moves along with the foe, always remaining within reach. If you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) multiple times in a round, you gain this effect each time. The shadow uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.

The shadow's [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) are melee spell attacks. Regardless of its shape, the shadow's [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deal damage equal to `1d10` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You choose the type of damage when you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), choosing from bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. The shadow doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The shadow can't make any attacks other than its [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).

The shadow vanishes if the target moves into an area of complete darkness or enters an area with light from all directions such that the target doesn't cast a shadow. If another effect is controlling the target's shadow when you cast [malicious shadow](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/malicious-shadow-apg.md), you can attempt to counteract that effect to temporarily take control of the shadow, but the original effect resumes when malicious shadow ends.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) damage increases by `1d10`.
