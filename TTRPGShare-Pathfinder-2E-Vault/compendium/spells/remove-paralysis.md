# Remove Paralysis *Spell 2*   
[healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature

A surge of energy frees a [paralyzed](../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) creature. You can attempt to counteract a single effect imposing the [paralyzed](../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition on the target. This does not cure someone who is [paralyzed](../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) from some natural state or effect, such as paralysis caused by non-magical wounds or toxins.

**Heightened (6th)** The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
