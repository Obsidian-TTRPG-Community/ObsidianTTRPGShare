# Enthrall *Spell 3*   
[auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**all creatures in range
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**sustained

Your words fascinate your targets. You speak or sing without interruption throughout the casting and duration. Targets who notice your speech or song might give their undivided attention; each target must attempt a Will save. The GM might grant a circumstance bonus (to a maximum of +4) if the target is of an opposing religion, ancestry, or political leaning, or is otherwise unlikely to agree with what you're saying.

Each creature that comes within range has to attempt a save when you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md). If you're speaking, enthrall gains the [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md) trait.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and notices that you tried to use magic.
> - **Success** The target needn't pay attention but doesn't notice you tried to use magic (it might notice others are enthralled).
> - **Failure** The target is [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) with you. It can attempt another Will save if it witnesses actions or speech with which it disagrees. If it succeeds, it's no longer [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) and is temporarily immune for 1 hour. If the target is subject to a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) act, or if another creature succeeds at a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check against it, the fascination ends immediately.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target can't attempt a save to end the fascination if it disagrees with you.
