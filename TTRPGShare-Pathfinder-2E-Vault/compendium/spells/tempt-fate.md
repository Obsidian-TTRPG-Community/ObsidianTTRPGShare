# Tempt Fate *Focus 4*   
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[fate](../setting/domains.md#Fate)]
- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw.
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**the triggering creature

You twist the forces of fate to make a moment dire or uneventful, with no in-between. The target gains a +1 status bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion.

If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails, but you don't expend the Focus Point for [Casting this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).

**Heightened (8th)** The bonus on the saving throw is +2.
