# Pillar Of Water *Spell 3*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [water](../../rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Duration**1 minute

You create a large, self-contained cylinder of still fresh water.

The pillar has a maximum radius of 15 feet and a maximum height of 60 feet. Creatures inside the pillar can swim through the water as normal ([Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md) DC 10), or, if the spell was cast on solid ground, walk along the bottom (which is difficult terrain)

Any creature that exits the pillar falls or lands accordingly.
