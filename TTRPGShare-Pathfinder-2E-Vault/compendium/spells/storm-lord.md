# Storm Lord *Focus 9*   
[air](../../rules/traits/air.md)  [druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Requirements**You are outdoors and aboveground.
- **Area**100-foot emanation which affects you
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

The sky above you darkens in a matter of moments, swirling with ominous clouds punctuated by flashes of lighting. The first time you [Sustain this Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) each round, you can select one of the following effects to occur in the area.

- **Calm** No additional effect.
- **Fog** Heavy fog rolls in, concealing the area with the effects of [obscuring mist](obscuring-mist.md).
- **Rain** Torrential rain falls from the sky, dousing ordinary flames. Creatures in the area take a –2 circumstance penalty to [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) and [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks.
- **Wind** Powerful winds buffet the area in all directions

Ranged attacks take a –4 circumstance penalty, and all flying is against the wind and counts as moving through difficult terrain.

In addition, once per round you can use a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) and [manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) traits, to call down a bolt of lightning, striking any target in range that you can see. You deal `10d6` electricity damage to the target; it must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it is also [deafened](../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 round.
