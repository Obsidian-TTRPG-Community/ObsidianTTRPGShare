# Weird *Spell 9*   
[death](../../rules/traits/death.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**any number of creatures
- **Saving Throw** Will

You fill the targets' minds with terrifying images of fearsome creatures, each drawn from the targets' worst fears. Only the targets can see their assailants. Each target takes `16d6` mental damage and must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage and is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If the target succeeds, it takes double damage and is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and it's also [fleeing](../../rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) until the end of its next turn unless it critically succeeded. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and dies.
