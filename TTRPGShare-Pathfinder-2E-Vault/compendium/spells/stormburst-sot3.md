# Stormburst *Spell 5*   
[electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot

Your voice projects like cracking thunder as you summon a localized storm, creating a fearsome surge of lightning and wind that deals `6d6` electricity damage. Each creature must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and is [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Heightened (7th)** The damage increases to `8d6`, and targets who critically fail are [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Heightened (9th)** The damage increases to `10d6`, and targets who critically fail are [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
