Superheated air collects under you, buoying you high into the sky before you plummet back down in a fiery comet.

You [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md) 15 feet straight up into the air, then [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md) in a straight line to an empty space of your choice on the ground within 60 feet. When you land, the blistering air blasts out from you, dealing `3d4` bludgeoning damage and `3d6` fire damage (basic Reflex save) to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d4` bludgeoning and `1d6` fire.
