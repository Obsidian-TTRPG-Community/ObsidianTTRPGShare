You briefly turn your attack into pure force to bypass your opponent's defenses. Choose a target within your reach, or within the reach of a melee weapon you're wielding.

If you can use [Spellstrike](../../rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) with a ranged weapon (with the starlit span hybrid study, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon. For an instant, you transform your weapon or unarmed attack into a spike of pure force, replacing all its normal statistics and abilities. The force fang automatically deals `1d4+1` force damage to the target.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d4+1`.
