# Ode To Ouroboros *Focus 5*   
[bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [composition](../../rules/traits/composition.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A creature's [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition would reach the value at which they would die.
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**the triggering creature

Your ode temporarily staves off death. The target's [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn't help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition, such as disintegrate and [death](../../rules/traits/death.md) effects.
