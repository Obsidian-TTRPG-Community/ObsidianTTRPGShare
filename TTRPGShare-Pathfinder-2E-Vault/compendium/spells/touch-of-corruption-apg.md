# Touch Of Corruption *Focus 1*   
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 willing undead creature or 1 living creature

You infuse the target with negative energy. If the target is living, this deals `1d6` negative damage (basic Fortitude save); on a failed save, the target also takes a –2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

If the target is a willing undead creature, the target instead regains 6 Hit Points, and if you are the undead target, you also gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls for 1 round.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage dealt to a living creature by `1d6` or increase the Hit Points regained by undead by 6.
