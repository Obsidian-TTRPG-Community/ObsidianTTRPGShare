# Dim The Light *Focus 1*   
[darkness](../../rules/traits/darkness.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You cast a darkness or shadow spell.

You magnify the darkness from the triggering effect, causing the ambient light level to flicker briefly so you can slip from sight. You can immediately attempt a [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md), and you can become [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to a creature even if you don't have cover and aren't otherwise [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from that creature.

You cease being [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) at the end of your turn unless you move into cover or become [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) before then.
