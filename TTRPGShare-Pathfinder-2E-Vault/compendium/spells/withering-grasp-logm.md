# Withering Grasp *Focus 1*   
[necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Domains**: [[decay](../setting/domains.md#Decay)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature or object

Your touch rots organic material and decays objects. Make a melee spell attack roll. Your touch deals `1d12` negative damage plus `1d4` [persistent negative damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). If a creature uses an item to block withering grasp, such as with the [Shield Block](../feats/shield-block.md) reaction, the item is automatically affected, but the creature does not take damage (even if there is Domains damage left over after the shield's Hardness). Unlike normal negative damage, the negative damage from withering grasp damages objects, constructs, and the like by eroding them away.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your touch deals double damage (both initial and persistent). If you target an object, lower its Hardness by 4 for 1 minute.
> - **Success** Your touch deals full damage. If you target an object, lower its Hardness by 2 for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d12` and the [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1. If you target an object, lower its Hardness by an additional 1 point on both a success and a critical success.
