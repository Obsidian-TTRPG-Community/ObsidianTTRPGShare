# Detect Scrying *Spell 4*   
[detection](../../rules/traits/detection.md)  [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot emanation
- **Duration**1 hour

By tapping into trace divinatory auras, you detect the presence of [scrying](../../rules/traits/scrying.md) effects in the area. If detect scrying is higher level than a [scrying](../../rules/traits/scrying.md) effect, you gain a glimpse of the scrying creature and learn its approximate distance and direction.

**Heightened (6th)** The duration is until the next time you make your daily preparations.
