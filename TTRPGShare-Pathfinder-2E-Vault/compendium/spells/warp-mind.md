# Warp Mind *Spell 7*   
[emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input.

The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. Warp mind's effects happen instantly, so [dispel magic](dispel-magic.md) and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, [alter reality](alter-reality.md), [miracle](miracle.md), [primal phenomenon](primal-phenomenon.md), [restoration](restoration.md), or [wish](wish.md) can still counteract the effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target spends the first action on its next turn with the [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) condition.
> - **Failure** The target is [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) permanently.
