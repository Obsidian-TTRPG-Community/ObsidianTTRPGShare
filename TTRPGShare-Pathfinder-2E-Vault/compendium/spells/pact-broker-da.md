You offer to broker a pact of peace. If the target accepts and doesn't take [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions against you and your allies, you take a –1 status penalty to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](../../rules/actions/lie.md) to them. If they refuse and take a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against you or an ally, they must attempt a Will save. If they accepted the offer and then take a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against you or an ally, they must attempt a Will save and treat the result as one category worse. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
