# Primal Phenomenon *Spell 10*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

You request a direct intercession from the natural world.

Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A [primal phenomenon](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/primal-phenomenon.md) spell can do any of the following things.

- Duplicate any spell from the primal list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be [common](../../rules/traits/common.md) or you must have access.
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the [wish](wish.md) spell.

At the GM's discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
