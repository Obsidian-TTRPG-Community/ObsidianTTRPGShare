# Baleful Polymorph *Spell 6*   
[incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude
- **Duration**varies

You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened). When it recovers from the [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition, its features revert to normal.
> - **Failure** The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.
