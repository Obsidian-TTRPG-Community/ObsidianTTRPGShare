# Storm Of Vengeance *Spell 9*   
[air](../../rules/traits/air.md)  [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**800 foot
- **Area**360-foot burst
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

A massive storm cloud forms in the air in a 360-foot burst.

Beneath it, rain begins to fall, and gales impose a –4 circumstance penalty to physical ranged attacks and weapon ranged attacks, and the air in the area becomes greater difficult terrain for flying creatures. When you [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) and the first time each round you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can choose one of the following storm effects. You can't choose the same effect twice in a row.

- **Acid Rain** Each creature in the storm takes `4d8` acid damage with no saving throw.
- **Hail** The storm deals `4d10` bludgeoning damage to creatures beneath it (basic Fortitude save).
- **Lightning** Up to 10 bolts of lightning strike down, targeting creatures of your choice in the storm. No more than one bolt can target any one creature. Each bolt deals `7d6` electricity damage (basic Reflex save).
- **Rain and Wind** Heavy rain and whipping wind reduce visibility and mobility, making the area under the storm cloud difficult terrain and making everything seen within or through the area [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed).
- **Thunderclap** Each creature in the storm must succeed at a Fortitude save or be [deafened](../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 10 minutes

A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to thunderclaps from storm of vengeance for 1 hour.

**Heightened (10th)** The range increases to 2,200 feet, and the cloud is a 1,000-foot burst.
