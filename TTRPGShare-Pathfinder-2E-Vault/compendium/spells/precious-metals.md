# Precious Metals *Focus 4*   
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[wealth](../setting/domains.md#Wealth)]
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 metal weapon, up to 10 pieces of metal or metal-tipped ammunition, 1 suit of metal armor, or up to 1 bulk of metal material (such as coins)
- **Duration**1 minute

Your deity blesses base metals to transform them into precious materials. The target item transforms from its normal metal into [cold iron](../equipment/items/cold-iron.md), copper, gold, iron, silver, or steel (the details for these metals are found on pages 577–579). An item transmuted in this way deals damage according to its new material. For example, a steel sword transmuted to [cold iron](../equipment/items/cold-iron-weapon.md) would deal additional damage to a creature with a weakness to cold iron.

This change is clearly magical and temporary, so the item's monetary value doesn't change; you couldn't transmute copper coins to gold and use those coins to purchase something or as a cost for a spell.

**Heightened (8th)** Add [adamantine](../equipment/items/adamantine.md) and [mithral](../equipment/items/mithral.md) to the list of metals you can transform the item into.
