# Stinking Cloud *Spell 3*   
[conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You create a cloud of putrid mist in the area. The cloud functions as [obscuring mist](obscuring-mist.md) except it sickens creatures that end their turns within the cloud. (The [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition is not a [poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md) effect.)

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Failure** The creature is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) while in the cloud.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until it leaves the cloud.
