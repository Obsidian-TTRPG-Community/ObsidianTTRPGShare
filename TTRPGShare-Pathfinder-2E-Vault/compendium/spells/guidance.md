# Guidance *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**until the start of your next turn

You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling.

If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
