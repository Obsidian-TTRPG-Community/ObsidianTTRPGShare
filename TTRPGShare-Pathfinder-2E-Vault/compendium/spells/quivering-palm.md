# Quivering Palm *Focus 8*   
[incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [monk](../../rules/traits/monk.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude
- **Duration**1 month

Make a melee unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) and [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
> - **Success** The target is [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and takes 40 damage, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
> - **Failure** The target is [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and takes 80 damage. The spell's duration continues, but the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by quivering palm.
> - **Critical Failure** The target dies. If you cast [quivering palm](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/quivering-palm.md) again, the effects of any quivering palm you had previously cast end.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success.
