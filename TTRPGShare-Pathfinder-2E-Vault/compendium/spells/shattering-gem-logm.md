# Shattering Gem *Spell 1*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**1 minute

A large gem floats around the target in an erratic pattern. The gem has 5 Hit Points. Each time a creature [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) the target, the target attempts a DC 11 flat check. On a success, the gem blocks the attack, so the attack first damages the gem and then applies any remaining damage to the target. If the gem is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters, immediately dealing the creature that destroyed it `1d8` slashing damage (basic Reflex save), as long as that creature is within 10 feet of the target.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The gem has 5 additional HP, and the damage dealt by its detonation increases by `1d8`.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
