[evil](../../rules/traits/evil.md)  [morph](../../rules/traits/morph.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Devil horns grow from your skull, and your skin takes on features of the devil responsible for your diabolic bloodline.

You gain resistance 5 to evil, fire, and poison, and resistance 1 to physical damage (except silver). You can take good damage, even if you aren't evil, and you gain weakness 5 to good damage.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance to evil, fire, and poison increases by 5, the resistance to physical damage (except silver) by 2, and the weakness to good damage by 5.
