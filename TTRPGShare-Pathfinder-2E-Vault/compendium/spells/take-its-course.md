- **Domains**: [[indulgence](../setting/domains.md#Indulgence)]

When someone has overindulged, you can hasten them past the worst of their affliction or intensify their misery.

This spell attempts to progress a disease affliction, a poison affliction, or [persistent poison damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) affecting the target.

If the target is affected by more than one of these, you can choose from among those you are aware of; otherwise the GM chooses randomly. An unwilling target can attempt a Will save to negate take its course.

The effect of this spell depends on whether you're attempting to end an affliction or [persistent poison damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and whether you are attempting to help or hinder the target's recovery.

- **Affliction** The target immediately attempts its next saving throw against the affliction. You can grant the creature your choice of a +2 status bonus or a –2 status penalty to its saving throw against the affliction.
- **Persistent Poison** You can cause the target take the [persistent poison damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) immediately when you [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) (in addition to taking it at the end of its next turn). Whether or not you do so, the target attempts an additional flat check against the [persistent poison damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). You can set the DC of that flat check to 5 or 20 instead of the normal DC.

**Heightened (7th)** You can attempt to progress any number of the target's eligible afflictions and [persistent poison damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
