# Poltergeist's Fury *Spell 6*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Area**20-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw**  basic Reflex
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

Your fury spills over in a telekinetic storm of terrifying proportions. Any loose, unattended objects of 1 Bulk or less within range are picked up and begin to orbit you at breathtaking speeds. All creatures in the area take `6d4` piercing damage with a basic Reflex save. Each time you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can increase the radius of the storm by 10 feet, to a maximum of 100 feet. The storm moves with you and provides you with lesser cover, though you can't use this cover to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md). Allies within the storm who roll a success on their Reflex save against your poltergeist's fury get a critical success instead, as you attempt to avoid hitting them.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d4`.
