# Diamond Dust *Focus 4*   
[cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Domains**: [[cold](../setting/domains.md#Cold)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot emanation centered on you
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude
- **Duration**1 minute

You supercool the nearby air, forming a cloud of dancing ice crystals in an emanation around you. A creature other than you that enters the area or ends its turn within the area takes `2d6` cold damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. The crystals scatter and refract light; if a [light](../../rules/traits/light.md) effect enters diamond dust's area, any creatures that effect goes on to affect gain a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against it.

While the spell persists, you can activate or deactivate this aura by using a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait.

You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) this spell.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
