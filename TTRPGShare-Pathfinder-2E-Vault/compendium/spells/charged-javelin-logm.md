# Charged Javelin *Focus 1*   
[attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)  [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Domains**: [[lightning](../setting/domains.md#Lightning)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 or more creatures

You fire a javelin of electricity that leaves a charged field around its target. Make a spell attack roll. The javelin deals `1d6` electricity damage and 1 [persistent electricity damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The javelin deals double damage, both initial and persistent.
> - **Success** The javelin deals full damage. As long as the target is taking [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this spell, creatures gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls with metal weapons or [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md) effects against the target, and the target takes a –1 status penalty to saves against [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md) effects.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d6`, and the [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1.
