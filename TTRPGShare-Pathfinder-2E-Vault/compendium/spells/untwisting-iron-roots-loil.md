# Untwisting Iron Roots *Focus 5*   
[earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**10-foot emanation

You manipulate the earth beneath your feet to throw your enemies off balance, leaving chunks of rock and rubble behind. Creatures within range take `2d6` bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex save; on a failed save, they also fall [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). The affected area becomes difficult terrain, but you can move through the difficult terrain normally.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
