# Hypnotic Pattern *Spell 3*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air in a geometric cloud. Creatures are [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, when it enters the pattern, when it ends its turn within the pattern, or if it uses a [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) or [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action on the pattern. A creature currently [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the pattern doesn't attempt new saves.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target is [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the pattern.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the pattern. While it remains [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), it can't use reactions.
