# Weapon Surge *Focus 1*   
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[zeal](../setting/domains.md#Zeal)]
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 weapon you're wielding

Holding your weapon aloft, you fill it with divine energy. On your next [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with that weapon before the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll and the weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon has a striking rune, this instead increases the number of dice from the striking rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice)

If the target weapon leaves your possession, weapon surge immediately ends.
