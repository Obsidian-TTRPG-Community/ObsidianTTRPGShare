You mimic the process of aging or erosion on the target.

The effect depends on whether the target is an object, a construct, or a living creature. Artifacts and objects and constructs made of precious materials, as determined by the GM, are immune.

- **Object** If the object is attended, its bearer can attempt a Fortitude save. If the bearer fails or the object is unattended, the object immediately takes `4d6` damage (applying Hardness normally) and the item is cursed with an unlimited duration. Until the curse ends, the item becomes shoddy and can't be Repaired, and the curse attempts to counteract any spell that would restore the object's Hit Points. Remove curse can target an item affected by this spell.
- **Construct** The construct takes `4d6` damage (basic Fortitude save). On a failure, for 1 hour the construct is [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), is [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), and can't be Repaired, and the curse attempts to counteract any spell that would restore the construct's Hit Points. On a critical failure, these effects have an unlimited duration.
- **Living Creature** The living creature must attempt a Fortitude save. Ageless creatures are immune.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The living creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The living creature briefly ages, becoming [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** As success, with a duration of 1 hour.
> - **Critical Failure** As success, with an unlimited duration.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
