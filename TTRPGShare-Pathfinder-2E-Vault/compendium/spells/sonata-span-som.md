# Sonata Span *Spell 2*   
[auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot line
- **Duration**sustained

By playing a brief tune on an instrument or in song, you cause the notes of the melody to physically manifest into a shimmering, translucent path. This path doesn't need to be over solid ground and can tilt up or down diagonally up to 45 degrees, but it must be a straight, 5-foot-wide line.

It can support as many creatures as can physically fit on the bridge.
