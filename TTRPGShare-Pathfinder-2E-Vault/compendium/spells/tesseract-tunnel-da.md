# Tesseract Tunnel *Cantrip 5*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  [teleportation](../../rules/traits/teleportation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You race from point to point, tearing open a tunnel in space. You create a portal in your current space and then [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), creating another portal in the space you end your [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md). Until the beginning of your next turn, any creature that enters the first portal can immediately transport itself to the exit portal as part of its move action, which adds the [teleportation](../../rules/traits/teleportation.md) trait to its movement.

You can have only one tesseract tunnel open at a time; creating another causes the first to immediately close. You can use tesseract tunnel while [Burrowing](../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

## Amp

Physical movement is no longer necessary to connect two points in space. When you cast tesseract tunnel, you simply create a tunnel that ends in a square within a range equal to your Speed; you can choose to immediately teleport to the space at the far end of the tunnel. Furthermore, the tunnel can be traversed in both directions, instead of only from entrance to exit. Finally, the spell's duration changes to 1 minute. You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.
