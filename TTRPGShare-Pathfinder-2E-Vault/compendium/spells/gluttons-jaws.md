Your mouth transforms into a shadowy maw bristling with pointed teeth. These jaws are an unarmed attack with the [forceful](../../rules/traits/forceful.md) trait dealing `1d8` piercing damage. If you hit with your jaws and deal damage, you gain `1d6` temporary Hit Points.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The temporary Hit Points increase by 1d6.
