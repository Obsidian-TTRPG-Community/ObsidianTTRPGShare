# Illusory Disguise *Spell 1*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 hour

You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself. The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, such as making your armor look like a dress. Held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.

Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for the [Impersonate](../../rules/actions/impersonate.md) use of [Deception](../skills.md#Deception); it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and you add your level even if you're untrained. You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) this spell.

**Heightened (2nd)** The spell also disguises your voice and [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md), and it gains the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) and [olfactory](../../rules/traits/olfactory-b1.md) traits.

**Heightened (3rd)** You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual. You must have seen an individual to take on their appearance. The spell also disguises your voice and [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md), and it gains the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) trait.
