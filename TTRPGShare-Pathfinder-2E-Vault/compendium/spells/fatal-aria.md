- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You perform music so perfect that the target may die of joy or sorrow. Once targeted, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level and current Hit Points.

- **16th or Lower** The target dies instantly.
- **17th** If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying).
- **18th or Higher** The target takes 50 damage. If this brings it to 0 Hit Points, it dies instantly.
