# Elemental Form *Spell 5*   
[polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You call upon the power of the planes to transform into a Medium elemental battle form. When you cast this spell, choose air, earth, fire, or water. While in this form, you gain the corresponding trait and the [elemental](../../rules/traits/elemental.md) trait. You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions.

You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 10 temporary Hit Points.
- [Darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +18, and your damage bonus is +9. These are Dexterity based ([air](../../rules/traits/air.md) or [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md)) or Strength based ([earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md) or [water](../../rules/traits/water.md)). If your corresponding unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- **Acrobatics** ([air](../../rules/traits/air.md) or [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md)) or [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) (earth or water) modifier of +20; ignore this change if your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the type of elemental you choose:
- **Air** fly Speed 80 feet, movement doesn't trigger reactions; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") gust, **Damage** `1d4` bludgeoning.
- **Earth** Speed 20 feet, burrow Speed 20 feet; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") fist, **Damage** `2d10` bludgeoning.
- **Fire** Speed 50 feet; fire resistance 10, weakness 5 to cold and 5 to water; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") tendril, **Damage** `1d8` fire plus `1d4` [persistent fire](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
- **Water** Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 60 feet; fire resistance 5; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") wave, **Damage** `1d12` bludgeoning, and you can spend an action immediately after a hit to push the target 5 feet with the effects of a successful [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md).

**Heightened (6th)** Your battle form is Large and your attacks have 10-foot reach. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 15 temporary HP, an attack modifier of +23, a damage bonus of +13, and [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) +23.
