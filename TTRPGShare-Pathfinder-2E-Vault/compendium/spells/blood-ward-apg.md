You consolidate warding energies with a gesture, guarding a creature against attacks from a certain type of foe. Designate one of the following creature traits: aberration, animal, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, fungus, monitor, ooze, plant, or undead. The target gains a +1 status bonus to its saving throws and AC against creatures with that trait. The target is temporarily immune for 10 minutes.

**Heightened (5th)** The status bonus increases to +2.
