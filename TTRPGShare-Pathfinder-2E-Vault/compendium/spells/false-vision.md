# False Vision *Spell 5*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** 10 minutes 
- **Range**touch
- **Area**100-foot burst
- **Duration**until the next time you make your daily preparations

You create a false image that fools any attempts to scry on an area. Any [scrying](scrying.md) spell sees, hears, smells, and otherwise detects whatever you wish within the area, rather than what is actually in the area. You can [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) each round to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a complex scene. If the [scrying](scrying.md) spell is of a higher level than false vision, the scryer can attempt a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check to 0, though even if they're successful, they can't learn what's truly going on in the area.
