# Consuming Darkness *Focus 5*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [shadow](../../rules/traits/shadow.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**10-foot emanation
- **Targets**enemies in the area
- **Saving Throw** Reflex
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

Your shadow wriggles before spreading out from you, forming a gateway of clinging, consuming shadow through which the horrors of another plane can barely be seen. The first time each turn you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), the radius increases by 5 feet.

Each enemy that enters the area or begins its turn in the area takes `2d6` negative damage and must attempt a Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature sinks partially into the shadow, taking half damage and a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for as long it remains in the area.
> - **Failure** As success, but the creature takes full damage and a –10-foot circumstance penalty.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is absorbed into the shadows, where it can be seen below the surface; it takes double damage and is [immobilized](../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round or until it [Escapes](../../rules/actions/escape.md).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
