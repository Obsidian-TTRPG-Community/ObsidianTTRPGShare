# Phantom Crowd *Spell 2*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**a 10-foot square
- **Duration**sustained up to 10 minutes

A tightly packed crowd of humanoids appropriate to the area appear, facing you and agreeing loudly with anything you say. A creature that touches a member of the crowd or makes a [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) action to examine the crowd can attempt to 0. The crowd is difficult terrain for anyone who hasn't 0.

When you spend 1 or more actions to cast a composition spell (Core Rulebook 386) or to perform an activity that includes a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check, you can also Sustain this Spell as part of that action.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The crowd occupies an additional 10-foot square in range. The additional square doesn't need to be adjacent to any other square created by the spell. It can overlap, but there's no additional effect in the overlapped squares.
