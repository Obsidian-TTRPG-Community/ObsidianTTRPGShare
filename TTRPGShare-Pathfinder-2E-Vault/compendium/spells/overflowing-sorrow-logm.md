# Overflowing Sorrow *Focus 4*   
[emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Domains**: [[sorrow](../setting/domains.md#Sorrow)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot emanation, centered on you
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

Sadness flows out of you into nearby creatures, blotting out any other thoughts they had. The first time a creature begins its turn in the area or enters the area, it must attempt a Will save. If it later leaves and reenters the area, it uses the same effect as before.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes a –1 status penalty to skill checks and [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks as long as it remains in the area.
> - **Failure** While the creature is in the area, any [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md) effects of lower counteract level than overflowing sorrow are suppressed, and whenever the creature attempts to use an emotion action or cast an emotion spell, it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check or the action or spell is disrupted.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature cannot use emotion actions or spells.

**Heightened (+ 2)** When you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can choose to increase the area by 5 feet.
