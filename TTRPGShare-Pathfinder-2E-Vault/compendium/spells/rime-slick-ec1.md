# Rime Slick *Spell 2*   
[cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**15-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**  basic Reflex
- **Duration**1 minute

You call down a chill wind. When you Cast this Spell, you deal `2d4` cold damage to each creature in the area (basic Reflex save). If a creature in the area critically fails its Reflex save and was standing, it also falls [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).

You also create a layer of ice on all surfaces in the area, which become difficult terrain. Unattended objects in the area become slick with ice, and picking them up requires a successful Reflex save or [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check against your spell DC. The ice melts on any object that takes fire damage as well as in any square included in the area of a higher-level spell or effect with the [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md) trait.

**Heightened (5th)** The damage increases to `8d4` cold damage and the area is a 30-foot burst.

**Heightened (8th)** The damage increases to `14d4` cold damage and the area is a 60-foot burst.
