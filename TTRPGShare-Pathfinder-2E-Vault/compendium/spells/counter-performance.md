# Counter Performance *Focus 1*   
[bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [composition](../../rules/traits/composition.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You or an ally within 60 feet rolls a saving throw against an [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) effect.
- **Area**60-foot emanation

Your performance protects you and your allies. Roll a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check for a type you know: an auditory performance if the trigger was auditory, or a visual one for a visual trigger. You and allies in the area can use the better result between your [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check and the saving throw.
