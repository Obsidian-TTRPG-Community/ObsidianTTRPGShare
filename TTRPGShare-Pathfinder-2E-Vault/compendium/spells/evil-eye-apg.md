Your fix your eye on the target, imposing a malevolent hex.

The target becomes [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) based on the results of its Will save. This condition value can't be reduced below 1 while the spell is active and you can see the target. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
