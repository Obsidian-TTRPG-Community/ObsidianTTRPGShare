- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**5-foot burst or more
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude
- **Duration**1 minute

Ground in the area turns swampy and fetid. The area is difficult terrain. The sludge at the bottom of the morass animates into diminutive sludge beasts that have a demonic appearance. These don't function as normal creatures, but they swarm over creatures in the swamp and exude a noxious stench. The swamp deals `1d6` poison damage; creatures that end their turn in the area must attempt a basic Fortitude save. You can increase the number of actions it takes to [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md). For each additional action, increase the burst's radius by 5 feet.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by 1d6, and the initial radius increases by 5 feet.
