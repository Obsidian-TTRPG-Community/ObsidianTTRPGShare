# Biting Words *Spell 1*   
[attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)  [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md)  [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You entwine magic with your voice, causing your taunts and jibes to physically harm your enemies. You can attack with your words once when you finish [Casting the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), and can repeat the attack once on each of your subsequent turns by taking a single action, which has the attack, [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md), and [linguistic](../../rules/traits/linguistic.md) traits. After your third attack total, the spell ends.

When you attack with biting words, make a ranged spell attack roll against a creature within 30 feet, dealing `2d6` sonic damage if you hit (or double damage on a critical hit).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6`.
