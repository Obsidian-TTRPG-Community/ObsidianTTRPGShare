# Modify Memory *Spell 4*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**

You alter the target's memories, either erasing a memory, enhancing a memory's clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and realizes you tried to alter its memory.
> - **Success** The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of modify memory, unless it identifies the spell.
> - **Failure** During the first 5 minutes of the spell's duration, you can [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) to modify a memory once each round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes of memory. Any memories you've altered remain changed as long as the spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes is up, you can't alter any further memories.

**Heightened (6th)** You can cast the spell on a willing target to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in 50 words or fewer. The effect is permanent, and it patches these omissions with an indistinct haze.
