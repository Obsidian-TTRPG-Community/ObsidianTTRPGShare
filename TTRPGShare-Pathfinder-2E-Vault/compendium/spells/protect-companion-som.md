# Protect Companion *Cantrip 1*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**your eidolon, or a creature with the [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md) trait under your control
- **Duration**until the start of your next turn

You extend your aura, as a magical shield that protects your eidolon or minion. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. You gain the following reaction; after using the reaction, the spell ends and you can't cast [protect companion](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/protect-companion-som.md) again for 10 minutes.

Life Block [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") Trigger The spell's target would take damage; Effect Reduce the triggering damage by 10, but you lose 5 Hit Points. Even if this reduces the damage to 0, the target still takes any effects that would come with the damage, such as the poison on a viper's fangs [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The reaction reduces the damage by another 10, and you lose 5 more Hit Points. If you want to lose fewer Hit Points, you can choose to lower the damage reduction and HP lost to what any lower-level version of the spell could do without lowering the spell's actual level.
