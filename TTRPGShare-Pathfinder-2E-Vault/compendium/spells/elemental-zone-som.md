# Elemental Zone *Spell 2*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot radius burst
- **Duration**1 minute

Select an elemental trait: [air](../../rules/traits/air.md), [earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md), [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md), or [water](../../rules/traits/water.md). Elemental zone gains the trait you chose. You imbue the area with the raw energy of that element, creating a zone that emits and amplifies magic of that type. The temperature might suddenly rise or fall, a storm cloud might form, and so on. Spells with the chosen elemental trait cast against creatures in the zone get a +2 status bonus to one damage type the spell deals based on the chosen trait: bludgeoning or electricity for [air](../../rules/traits/air.md), bludgeoning for [earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md), fire for [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md), and bludgeoning or cold for [water](../../rules/traits/water.md). The caster chooses one type to add the bonus to if the spell deals more than one eligible type. This bonus is halved if the spell didn't use a spell slot (such as a cantrip, focus spell, or innate spell).

The zone has no effect on the spell if the spell doesn't deal any damage of an eligible type.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The status bonus increases by 1.
