- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") to 2 rounds 
- **Area**30-foot cone
- **Saving Throw**  basic Reflex

You draw elemental power from your surroundings, and combining it with your own magical energy, unleash a wave of utter destruction and swirling colors that deals `1d6` fire damage and `3d6` bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area and other parameters.

**[>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (somatic, verbal)** The spell is a 30-foot cone.

**[>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (material, somatic, verbal)** The spell is a 30-foot cone.

On a failed saving throw, creatures are pushed 5 feet away from you, and on a critical failure they are pushed 10 feet away and are knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Two Rounds** If you spend 3 actions [Casting the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, the spell is as 3 actions, but the area is a 60-foot cone, and for 1 round, the elements linger in the cone, racing off into the distance and making approaching you difficult, with the effects of [gust of wind](gust-of-wind.md).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `2d6`, and the distance that enemies are pushed back if you spent 3 actions or 2 rounds increases by 5 feet on a failed save and 10 feet on a critical failure.
