# Ranger's Bramble *Focus 3*   
[plant](../../rules/traits/plant.md)  [ranger](../../rules/traits/ranger.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**100 foot
- **Area**all squares that contain plants in a 5-foot burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You cause plants in the area to entangle your foes, with the effects of [entangle](entangle.md). A creature that critically fails the save takes `2d4` [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) in addition to being [immobilized](../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized).

[Escaping](../../rules/actions/escape.md) your bramble doesn't end the [bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The bleed damage on a critical failure increases by `1d4`.
