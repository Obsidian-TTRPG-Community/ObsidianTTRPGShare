# Foul Miasma *Focus 4*   
[disease](../../rules/traits/disease.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Domains**: [[plague](../setting/domains.md#Plague)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature affected by a disease
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

You multiply the disease within a creature, drawing it into an infectious mist outside their body where it can spread to other creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target is willing, it can choose to take the effects of critical failure.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target receives the benefit of a successful save against the lowest-level disease affecting it.
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** One randomly chosen disease affecting the target fills the air in a 15-foot emanation centered on the target. For the spell's duration, any creature that enters or ends its turn within the area is exposed to that disease.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the miasma contains all the diseases affecting the target.
