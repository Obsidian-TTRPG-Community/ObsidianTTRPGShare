# Mask Of Terror *Spell 7*   
[emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**1 minute

The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature.

The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.

When any creature attempts a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature becomes [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) before using its action.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature becomes [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and its action fails and is wasted.

**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask of terror.
