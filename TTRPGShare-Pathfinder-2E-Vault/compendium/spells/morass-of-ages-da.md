# Morass of Ages *Spell 4*   
[aura](../../rules/traits/aura.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**5-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You surround yourself in temporal eddies that draw out time for those around you, making every step feel like an eternity endured. A creature in the emanation, or that later enters the emanation, must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature makes this save only once and uses the same effect for the duration of the spell. Each time you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can choose to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet, to a maximum of 60 feet.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** Squares in the emanation are difficult terrain for the creature.
> - **Failure** Squares in the emanation are difficult terrain for the creature, and the creature is [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) when it starts its turn in the emanation.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, plus the creature also becomes [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained). The creature can attempt to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) against your spell DC to remove the [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.
