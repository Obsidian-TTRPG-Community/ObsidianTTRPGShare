# Negate Aroma *Spell 1*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 willing creature
- **Duration**1 hour

The target loses its odor, preventing creatures from passively noticing its presence via smell alone, even if the creatures have precise or imprecise [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md). A creature attempting a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check to [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) with [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md) and other senses might notice the lack of natural [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md). If the target has any abilities that result from its smell, such as an overpowering [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md), those abilities are also negated.

**Heightened (5th)** The range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
