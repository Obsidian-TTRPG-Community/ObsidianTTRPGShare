# Song Of Strength *Cantrip 1*   
[bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [composition](../../rules/traits/composition.md)  [emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**60-foot emanation
- **Duration**1 round

You bolster your allies' physical strength with a hearty exhortation. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) checks and to their DCs against [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) skill actions such as [Disarm](../../rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md), and [Trip](../../rules/actions/trip.md).

Special If you have the [inspire heroics](inspire-heroics.md) composition spell, you can use that composition to improve the bonus granted by song of strength in the same way as inspire courage or inspire defense.
