Harnessing your mastery of transformative magic, you take on a mutable form. You transform yourself into any form you could choose with a polymorph spell in your spell repertoire or that you could prepare of 8th level or lower (including any 8th-level or lower heightened versions of spells you know). You choose the type of creature as you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) rather than when you prepare it. You can change your form to any other form you could choose with this spell by using a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) this spell.
