You create a simple weapon of force. Make a melee spell attack roll against your target's AC. If you hit, you deal your choice of bludgeoning or slashing damage equal to `1d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage and can choose to detonate your weapon to push the target 10 feet away from you.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d8`.

## Amp

You form multiple force weapons to lash out at multiple foes. You make two imaginary weapon [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md), each against a different target. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you've made both [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md).

**Amp Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d8` instead of `1d8`.
