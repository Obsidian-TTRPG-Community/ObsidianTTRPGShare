# Vigilant Eye *Focus 4*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [wizard](../../rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Duration**1 hour

You create an [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) eye sensor, as [clairvoyance](clairvoyance.md).

When created, this eye must be in your line of sight. When the spell's duration ends, you can spend 1 Focus Point as a free action to extend the duration for another hour, though as normal, it ends immediately during your next daily preparations.
