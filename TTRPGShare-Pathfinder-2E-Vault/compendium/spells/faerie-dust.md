# Faerie Dust *Focus 1*   
[enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") or more 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Area**5-foot burst or more
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 round

You sprinkle magical dust in the spell's area, making those within easier to trick. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save. For each additional action you use [Casting the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), the burst's radius increases by 5 feet.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature can't use reactions and takes a –2 status penalty to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks and Will saves.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature also takes a –1 status penalty to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks and Will saves for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 3)** The initial radius increases by 5 feet.
