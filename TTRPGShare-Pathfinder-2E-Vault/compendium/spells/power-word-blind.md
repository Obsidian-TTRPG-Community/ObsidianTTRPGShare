You utter an arcane word of power that can make the target [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) upon hearing it. Once targeted, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level.

- **11th or Lower** The target is [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) permanently.
- **12th–13th** The target is [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for `1d4` minutes.
- **14th or Higher** The target is [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2.
