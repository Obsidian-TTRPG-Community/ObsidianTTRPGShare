# Quicken Time *Spell 5*   
[transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You speed up the time stream in an area, stretching and pulling it until time flows swift and wild. Any creature that begins its turn in the area is [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) and can use the extra action each round to [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). Unfortunately, speeding up time is much more difficult than slowing it down, and the effect is uneven and jittery, making accuracy between times painfully difficult; creatures inside the area are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to those outside it, and vice versa.
