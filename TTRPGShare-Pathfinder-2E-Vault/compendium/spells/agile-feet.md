# Agile Feet *Focus 1*   
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[travel](../setting/domains.md#Travel)]

- **Duration**until the end of the current turn

The blessings of your god make your feet faster and your movements more fluid. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed and ignore difficult terrain. As part of casting agile feet, you can [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md); you can instead [Burrow](../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md) if you have the appropriate Speed.
