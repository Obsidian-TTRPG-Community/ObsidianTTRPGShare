# Nature's Enmity *Spell 9*   
[enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**500-foot burst
- **Targets**up to 5 creatures
- **Duration**10 minutes

Animals and plants and fungi in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it remains in the area.

- Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants.
- Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal `2d10` slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.
- The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails.

Furthermore, animal or plant creatures become [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion.

The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.
