# Dragon Form *Spell 6*   
[polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Calling upon powerful transformative magic, you gain a Large dragon battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose one type of chromatic or metallic dragon. While in this form, you gain the [dragon](../../rules/traits/dragon.md) trait.

You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions. You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 10 temporary Hit Points.
- Speed 40 feet, fly Speed 100 feet.
- Resistance 10 against the damage type of your breath weapon (see below).
- [Darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) and imprecise [scent](../../rules/abilities/scent.md) 60 feet.
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +22, and your damage bonus is +6. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead. See below for more on these attacks.
- [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +23, unless your own modifier is higher.
- **Breath Weapon** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") ([arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)) The shape, damage, and damage type of your breath weapon depend on your specific dragon form (see below). A creature in the area attempts a basic save against your spell DC. This is a Reflex save unless stated otherwise in the special ability description for your specific dragon form. Once activated, your breath weapon can't be used again for `1d4` rounds. Your breath weapon has the trait corresponding to the type of damage it deals.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of dragon you choose:
