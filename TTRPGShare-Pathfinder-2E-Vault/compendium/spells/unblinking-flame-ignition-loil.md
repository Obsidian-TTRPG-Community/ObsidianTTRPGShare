# Unblinking Flame Ignition *Focus 9*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A foe reduces you to half your Hit Points or fewer.
- **Duration**3 rounds

You feel the most alive when pushed into a corner, as the insights and vision granted by the flame stoke into overdrive. Your body begins to emit a blazing aura of flames. You gain greater darkvision, low-light vision, and the ability to see [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed as you launch flame from your aura to soar through the sky. You become [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened), and you can use the extra action each round only to [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) or [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md) using your flames. Any creature who starts their turn within 5 feet of you takes `1d12` fire damage.
