# Perfected Mind *Focus 1*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[perfection](../setting/domains.md#Perfection)]
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

You meditate upon perfection to remove all distractions from your mind. Attempt a new Will save against one [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect currently affecting you that required a Will save. Use the result of this new save to determine the outcome of the [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effect, unless the new save would have a worse result than the original save, in which case nothing happens. You can use perfected mind against a given effect only once.
