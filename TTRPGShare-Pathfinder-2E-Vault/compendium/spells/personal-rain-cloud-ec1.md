- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Reflex
- **Duration**1 minute

You conjure a 5-foot-wide rain cloud that follows the target wherever it goes. It stays roughly an arm's length overhead, unless it must drift lower to fit under a ceiling.

The cloud rains constantly on the target, keeping it wet and dampening the ground in the wake of any movement.

The rain extinguishes non-magical flames. The target gains fire resistance 2. Creatures with weakness to water take damage equal to their weakness at the end of each of their turns. Creatures can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the cloud.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of fire resistance increases by 2.
