# Swampcall *Spell 1*   
[earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You call upon the spirits of the soil to twist and churn, transforming the terrain in the targeted area into a sodden mess. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when you Cast this Spell must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature sinks partially into the mud. The creature takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds (except for its swim Speed, if any) and becomes [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed). These effects last until the creature leaves the area or until the end of its next turn, whichever comes first.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty to Speeds (except [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md) speed) is –15 feet.

**Heightened (3rd)** The range increases to 60 feet, and the area increases to a 20-foot burst.
