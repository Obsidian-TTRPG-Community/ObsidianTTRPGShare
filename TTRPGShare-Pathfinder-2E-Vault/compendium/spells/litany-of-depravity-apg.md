# Litany Of Depravity *Focus 7*   
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [evil](../../rules/traits/evil.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [litany](../../rules/traits/litany.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 good creature
- **Duration**1 round

Your litany calls into question the morals your foe claims to hold dear. The target gains weakness 7 to evil, then becomes temporarily immune to all your litanies for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The weakness increases by 1.
