# Gust Of Wind *Spell 1*   
[air](../../rules/traits/air.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**60-foot line
- **Duration**until the start of your next turn

A violent wind issues forth from your palm, blowing from the point where you are when you cast the spell to the line's opposite end. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Large or smaller creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that later move into the gust must attempt the save on entering.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature can't move against the wind.
> - **Failure** The creature is knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). If it was flying, it suffers the effects of critical failure instead.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 30 feet in the wind's direction, knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage.
