You alter a creature's shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. The creature must attempt a Will save. A creature that has the [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition from unspeakable shadow must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the [fleeing](../../rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) condition).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It can't reduce its [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value below 1 for 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must succeed at a Fortitude save or die; this saving throw has the [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md) trait. If it succeeds at its save, the target is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and can't reduce its [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value below 1 for 1 minute.
