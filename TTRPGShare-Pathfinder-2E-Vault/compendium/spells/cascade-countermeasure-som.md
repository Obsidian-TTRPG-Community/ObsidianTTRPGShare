# Cascade Countermeasure *Focus 3*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Requirements**You're benefiting from [Arcane Cascade](../../rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md).
- **Duration**until the [Arcane Cascade](../../rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) stance ends

You quickly adjust your Arcane Cascade to offer magical protection. You gain resistance 5 against damage from spells. As normal, using Arcane Cascade again means you've ended the stance, and the spell ends.

**Heightened (+ 3)** The resistance increases by 5.
