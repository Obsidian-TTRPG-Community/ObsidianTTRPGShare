Your divine singing mends wounds and provides a temporary respite from harm. The target gains fast healing 2. When you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) and the first time each round you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), the target gains 2 temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 round.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The fast healing and temporary Hit Points each increase by 2.
