# Invisibility *Spell 2*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**10 minutes

Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible). This makes it [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected) to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to them instead (page 466). If the target uses a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, the spell ends after that [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action is completed.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action.
