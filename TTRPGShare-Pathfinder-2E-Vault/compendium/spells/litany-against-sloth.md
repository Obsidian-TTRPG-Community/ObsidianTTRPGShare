# Litany Against Sloth *Focus 5*   
[champion](../../rules/traits/champion.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [good](../../rules/traits/good.md)  [litany](../../rules/traits/litany.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 evil creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 round

Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the target's ability to react. The target must attempt a Will save.

A particularly slothful creature, such as a sloth demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target can't use reactions.
> - **Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed).
> - **Critical Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed).
