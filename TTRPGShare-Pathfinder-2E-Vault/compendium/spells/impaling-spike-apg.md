# Impaling Spike *Spell 5*   
[conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Reflex
- **Duration**1 minute

You conjure a spike that thrusts up from the earth beneath a target creature, potentially impaling it. The spike is made of cold iron and deals `8d6` piercing damage. The target must attempt a Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target dodges the spike and is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is struck by the spike and takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The target is impaled through a leg or another non-vital body part. The creature takes full damage and, if it's standing on solid ground, becomes [immobilized](../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized). It can attempt to [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) (the DC is your spell DC). While it remains impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to cold iron it has at the end of each of its turns.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is impaled through a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage, and it is [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) as long as it's impaled.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6`.
