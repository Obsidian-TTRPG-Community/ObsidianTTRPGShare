# Horizon Thunder Sphere *Spell 1*   
[attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)  [electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") to 2 rounds 
- **Range**varies
- **Targets**1 creature

You gather magical energy into your palm, forming a concentrated ball of electricity that crackles and rumbles like impossibly distant thunder. Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC. On a success, you deal `3d6` electricity damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and is [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the range and other parameters.

**[>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (somatic, verbal)** This spell has a range of 30 feet.

**[>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (material, somatic, verbal)** This spell has a range of 60 feet and deals half damage on a failure (but not a critical failure) as the electricity lashes out and jolts the target.

**Two Rounds** If you spend 3 actions [Casting the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, after attacking the target, whether you hit or miss, the ball of lightning explodes, dealing `2d6` electricity damage to all other creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the target (basic Reflex save). Additionally, you spark with electricity for 1 minute, dealing 1 electricity damage to creatures that Grab you or that hit you with an unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) or a non-reach melee weapon.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage on a hit, as well as the burst damage for two-round casting time, each increase by `2d6`, and the damage creatures take if they [Grapple](../../rules/actions/grapple.md) or hit you while you're in your sparking state increases by 1.
