# Fungal Hyphae *Spell 2*   
[fungus](../../rules/traits/fungus-b1.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Thin hyphae grow from your feet and plunge into the earth, creating a symbiotic fungal network that attaches to plants within 30 feet and connects you to their root systems.

You gain an imprecise [tremorsense](../../rules/abilities/tremorsense.md) allowing you to sense anything directly touching plants within that distance. If you move, the hyphae snap and the spell ends.

**Heightened (4th)** You can control plants in the area to a small degree, allowing you to make [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with tree branches, exposed roots, or similarly solid plants. To do so, you use a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) action, but you can [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) any creature you can detect with your [tremorsense](../../rules/abilities/tremorsense.md). These are melee spell attacks that deal `2d8` bludgeoning damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Unusual plants, such as thorny vines, might deal a different type of damage at the GM's discretion. You can't make any other attacks through these plants, or take any other actions through them, other than these [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md).

**Heightened (6th)** As 4th level, but you can use other simple manipulate actions through the plants, including having a branch pick an object up or open a door, though more complex actions, such as picking a lock or disabling a trap, remain impossible.
