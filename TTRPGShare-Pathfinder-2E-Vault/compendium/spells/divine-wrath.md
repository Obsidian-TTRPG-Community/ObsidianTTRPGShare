# Divine Wrath *Spell 4*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You can channel the fury of your deity against foes of opposed alignment. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. You deal `4d10` damage of the alignment you chose; each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. Creatures that match the alignment you chose are unaffected. Those that neither match nor oppose it treat the result of their saving throw as one degree better.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened); while it is [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), it is also [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d10`.
