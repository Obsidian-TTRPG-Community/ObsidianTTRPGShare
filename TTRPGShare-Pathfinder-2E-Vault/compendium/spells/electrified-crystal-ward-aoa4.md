# Electrified Crystal Ward *Focus 3*   
[electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 hinge or latch

You create an [electric latch rune](../gm/hazards/electric-latch-rune.md) hazard on the target, creating a special crystalline lock on the object. You can also substitute your spell DC for any of the hazard's listed DCs. You can have only one such hazard active at a time, and if you cast this spell while a previous electric latch rune is active, the older hazard discharges harmlessly.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The hazard's damage increases by `1d12`.
