# Horrific Visage *Focus 3*   
[emotion](../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md)  [illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot-radius emanation centered on you
- **Saving Throw** Will

You briefly transform your features into the horrific visage of a hag, striking fear into your enemies. Foes in the area must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The foe is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The foe is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The foe is [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

**Heightened (5th)** Foes in the area are [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a success, [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a failure, and [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [fleeing](../../rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) for 1 round on a critical failure. They are still unaffected on a critical success.
