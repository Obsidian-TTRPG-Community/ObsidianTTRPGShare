# Lightning Storm *Spell 5*   
[electricity](../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**  basic Reflex
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one lightning bolt within the spell's area. The bolt is a vertical line from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing `4d12` electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) each round, you can call another lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call down only one bolt per turn.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage of each bolt increases by `1d12`.
