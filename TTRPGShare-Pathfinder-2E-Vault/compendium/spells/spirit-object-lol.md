# Spirit Object *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [hex](../../rules/traits/hex-apg.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [rare](../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [witch](../../rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Patron** Witch
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") or [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 unattended object up to 1 Bulk

Using a sliver of Baba Yaga's power, you briefly bring an object to life. The object gains a means of locomotion, such as sprouting chicken legs, and [Strides](../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to 25 feet to a space you decide within range. If you spent 2 actions [Casting the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), the object then attacks one creature of your choice adjacent to its new space. Make a melee spell attack roll against the creature. On a success, the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (as appropriate for the object) equal to `1d4` plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and on a critical success, it takes double damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the maximum Bulk of the target by 1 and the damage by `1d4`.
