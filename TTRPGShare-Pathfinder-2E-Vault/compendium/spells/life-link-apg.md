You forge a connection of life energy between you and your target, distributing harm between both of you. When you first [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), the target recovers `1d4` Hit Points. The first time each round that the target takes damage, reduce the damage it takes by 3 (to a minimum of 0 damage). You lose 3 Hit Points each time, or the total damage dealt, if less than 3; this damage ignores any immunities or resistances you have and can't otherwise be mitigated in any way.

The spell ends immediately if you fall [unconscious](../../rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

**Heightened (3rd)** You can target 2 creatures other than you. Increase the initial healing to `3d4` and the maximum damage reduced and Hit Points lost to 5.

**Heightened (6th)** You can target 3 creatures other than you. Increase the initial healing to `6d4` and the maximum damage reduced and Hit Points lost to 10.

**Heightened (9th)** You can target 4 creatures other than you. Increase the initial healing to `9d4` and the maximum damage reduced and Hit Points lost to 15.
