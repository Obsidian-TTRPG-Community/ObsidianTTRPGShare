> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target's body gains minor bestial features. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round. When it recovers from the [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) condition, its features revert to normal and the spell ends.
> - **Failure** The target transforms into a bestial form for 1 hour. The target becomes [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and gains weakness 1 to silver. It gains a claw, hoof, horn, or jaws [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) (your choice) that uses the target's unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) statistics except that the damage type changes to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate. Whenever the target attempts to use any manipulate action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is unlimited.
