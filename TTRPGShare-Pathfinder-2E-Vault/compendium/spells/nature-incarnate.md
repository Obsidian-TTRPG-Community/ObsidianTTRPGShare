# Nature Incarnate *Spell 10*   
[polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

The primal power of the world flows through you. You transform into an incarnation of nature, either a green man or a kaiju. Your battle form is Medium for a green man or Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot space) for a kaiju. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. While in this form, you gain the [plant](../../rules/traits/plant.md) trait (for a green man) or the [beast](../../rules/traits/beast.md) trait (for a kaiju). You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 30 temporary Hit Points.
- [Darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +36, unless your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the type of incarnation you choose:
- **Green Man** Speed 40 feet, climb Speed 40 feet; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") vines ([reach <30 feet>](../../rules/traits/reach.md), [versatile <P>](../../rules/traits/versatile.md)), **Damage** `6d8+12` bludgeoning; **Ranged** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") thorns (range <100 feet>), **Damage** `6d6+6` piercing; Green Caress (aura, primal, transmutation) 60 feet. Enemies other than plants must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or become [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round ([clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) on a critical failure).
- **Kaiju** Speed 50 feet; resistance 5 to physical damage; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws ([reach <30 feet>](../../rules/traits/reach.md)), **Damage** `6d10+10` piercing; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") claws (agile, reach <30 feet>), **Damage** `6d8+8` slashing; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") foot (agile, reach <15 feet>), **Damage** `6d6+10` bludgeoning; Unstoppable You are immune to being [immobilized](../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain; Trample [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") You move up to double your Speed and move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature takes foot damage with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC.
