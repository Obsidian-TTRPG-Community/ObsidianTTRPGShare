A long, jagged needle jabs into the target foe's psyche whenever it tries to attack a specifically forbidden creature. Name yourself or one of your allies. The target takes 2 mental damage any time it uses a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against the named creature.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage by 2.
