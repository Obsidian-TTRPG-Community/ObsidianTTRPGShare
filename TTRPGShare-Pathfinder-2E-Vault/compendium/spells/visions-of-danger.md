- **Traditions**: [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Area**30-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

An illusion of horrific creatures fills the spell's area. The creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters with a specific appearance of your choice, such as Hellish flies or animated saw blades. The burst deals `8d8` mental damage (basic Will save) to each creature that's inside the burst when it's created, enters the burst, or starts its turn inside the burst. A creature that critically succeeds at its Will save can immediately attempt to 0. A creature that tries to [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) with the monsters or observes one with a [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) action can attempt to 0. Creatures that 0 take no damage from the illusion thereafter.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The mental damage increases by `1d8`.
