# Verminous Lure *Spell 1*   
[olfactory](../../rules/traits/olfactory-b1.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature or object
- **Duration**10 minutes

Upon casting, the target emits a musk that's captivating to certain animals. Tiny animals and animal swarms of any size within range must attempt a Will save. On a failure, non-[hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) animals or animal swarms try to touch the target. If [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile), such creatures choose to attack the target instead of other foes, if able to do so without spending additional actions or exposing themselves to additional danger.

Verminous lure doesn't change animals' attitudes towards the target and is easily overridden by more direct control, such as the [Command an Animal](../../rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) action.

Animals with imprecise sense can use their scent as a precise sense against the target.
