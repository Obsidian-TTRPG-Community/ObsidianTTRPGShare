You create numerous phantom copies of your weapon arm, hiding your true movements and rendering your attacks unpredictable. You gain a +2 status bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks. If you're untrained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), you can use the [Feint](../../rules/actions/feint.md) action anyway, and add your level as your proficiency bonus despite being untrained.
