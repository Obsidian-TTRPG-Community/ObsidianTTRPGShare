- **Duration**until the end of your next turn

You become [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and ignore natural difficult terrain (such as underbrush). Any [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action you use ends this invisibility, but you still ignore natural difficult terrain.

**Heightened (5th)** If you use a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, the invisibility doesn't end.
