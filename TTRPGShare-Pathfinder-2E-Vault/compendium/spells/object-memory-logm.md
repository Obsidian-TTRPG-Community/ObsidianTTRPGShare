# Object Memory *Focus 1*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  

- **Domains**: [[vigil](../setting/domains.md#Vigil)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Targets**1 weapon or tool
- **Duration**1 minute

By touching an object, you draw forth the experience of those who created and used it. If you touch a weapon, your proficiency rank with that weapon temporarily increases to trained (if it is not already higher). If you touch a tool, your proficiency rank with the next skill check you attempt with that tool (such as a [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) check with a blacksmith's hammer) within the spell's duration temporarily increases to trained (if it is not already higher). This spell has no benefit for activities that take longer than a minute to complete.

**Heightened (6th)** Your proficiency rank increases to expert instead of trained.
