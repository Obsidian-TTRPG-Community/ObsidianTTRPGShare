A deluge of colorful illusory paint, tools, or other symbols of art and artisanship drift down in the area. Roll `1d4` to determine the color of the illusion. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save. A creature is unaffected on a success. On a failure or critical failure, the creature takes the results listed on the table relevant to the color.
