[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot

A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air.

Creatures are [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) while inside the pattern, as are those within 20 feet of the pattern's area. A creature must attempt a Will save if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) or [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for `1d4` rounds.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for `1d4` rounds. After the [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) condition ends, the creature is [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for the remaining duration of the spell.
