# Redistribute Potential *Cantrip 5*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**2 adjacent 5-foot squares
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude

Energy attempts to balance out, but with your magic, you can shunt all the energy in one area to another. Creatures in either area take `4d4` damage with a basic Fortitude save. Choose one of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature that fails its save also becomes [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) from numbness if it's in the area of stolen heat or [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) from heat stroke if it's in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its save against; it's unaffected by the other area.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d4`.

## Amp

You can affect the flow of energy on a much grander scale. Instead of two 5-foot squares, you create two 10-foot bursts. They still must be adjacent to one another and can overlap. A creature in both areas can still be affected by only one of your choice. The spell's damage increases to `6d6`. The conditions last for 1 minute.

**Amp Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage by `2d6` instead of `1d4`.
