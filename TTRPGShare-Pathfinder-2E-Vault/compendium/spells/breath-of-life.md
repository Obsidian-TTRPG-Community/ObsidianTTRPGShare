# Breath Of Life *Spell 5*   
[healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [positive](../../rules/traits/positive.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A living creature within range would die.
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**the triggering creature

Your blessing revives a creature at the moment of its death.

You prevent the target from [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) and restore Hit Points to the target equal to `4d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can't use breath of life if the triggering effect was [disintegrate](disintegrate.md) or a [death](../../rules/traits/death.md) effect.
