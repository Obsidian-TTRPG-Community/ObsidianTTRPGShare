# Word Of Freedom *Focus 4*   
[cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[freedom](../setting/domains.md#Freedom)]
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**1 round

You utter a liberating word of power that frees a creature.

You suppress one of the following conditions of your choice: [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused), [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained), or [paralyzed](../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed). The target isn't affected by the chosen condition, and if you suppress the [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition, the target automatically breaks free from any grab or restraint affecting it when you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).

If you don't remove the effect that provided the condition, the condition returns after the spell ends. For example, if a spell was making the target [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 minute, word of freedom would let the target act normally for a round, but the [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) condition would return afterward.
