# Vomit Swarm *Spell 2*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot cone
- **Saving Throw**  basic Reflex

You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn't change the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone in the area, their bites and stings dealing `2d8` piercing damage (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened). Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage by `1d8`.
