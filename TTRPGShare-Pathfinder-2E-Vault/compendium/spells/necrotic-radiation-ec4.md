You imbue the touched object or space with slow-acting necrotic radiation. If you cast the spell on an object, any creature ending its turn holding or carrying the object takes `2d6` negative damage. If you cast the spell on an area, any creature ending its turn in the area takes `2d6` negative damage. You can attempt to use this spell on an attended object by touching the object. If you do, the creature attempts a Reflex save to reduce the effect.
