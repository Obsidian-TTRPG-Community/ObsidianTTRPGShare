You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target's mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs (as described on page 305). You suggest a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be selfdestructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.
> - **Success** The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.
> - **Failure** The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md) effects.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
