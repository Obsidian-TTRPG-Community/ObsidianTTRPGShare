# Ignite Fireworks *Spell 2*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md)  [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

A brilliant and clamorous display of sparks and colorful fireworks explode around your enemies, dealing `1d8` fire damage and `1d8` sonic damage to creatures within a 10-foot burst. All creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, takes `1d4` [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and is [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The initial fire damage increases by `1d8`, the sonic damage increases by `1d8`, and the [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) a creature takes on a critical failure increases by `1d4`.
