You surround your unarmed attacks with the speed and force of air. Make three unarmed Strikes against the same target. If at least one was a successful hit, the target must attempt a Fortitude save or be pushed back 5 feet for each normal hit from the buffet, plus 10 feet for each critical hit.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is pushed back half the normal distance.
> - **Failure** The target is pushed back the normal distance.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is pushed back double the normal distance and then knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
