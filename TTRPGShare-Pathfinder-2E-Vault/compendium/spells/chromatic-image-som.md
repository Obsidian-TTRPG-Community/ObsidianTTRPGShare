You call forth three illusory images of yourself, and each of the four of you takes on a different color, your colors all shifting each time someone attacks you. This has the effects of mirror image, except that whenever a foe destroys one of the images, roll `1d4` to see which color the image was when it was destroyed. The attacker takes the corresponding effect.

- **2. Orange** 5 acid damage and 5 mental damage.
- **3. Yellow** 5 electricity damage and 5 mental damage.
- **4. Green** 5 poison damage and 5 mental damage, plus it's [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
