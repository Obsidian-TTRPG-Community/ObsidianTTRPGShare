# Wash Your Luck *Cantrip 1*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Some practitioners argue this spell literally washes your fortunes of all influences, malign or benign, while others claim it simply cleanses your mind of obsessions about luck and destiny. You adjust your garments, change the posture of your chair, fidget with a religious symbol, or make some other innocuous and personally significant action to wash away bad luck.

Once during the spell's duration, before rolling a check, you can cancel out a [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect on that roll, as normal when a [fortune](../../rules/traits/fortune.md) and [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect apply to the same roll. After canceling out the [misfortune](../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect, the spell ends, and you are then temporarily immune to wash your luck for 10 minutes.
