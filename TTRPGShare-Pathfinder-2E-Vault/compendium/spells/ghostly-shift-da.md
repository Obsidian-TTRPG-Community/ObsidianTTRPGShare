# Ghostly Shift *Cantrip 3*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

Your body becomes insubstantial as you partially phase out. You gain resistance 2 to all damage (except force).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance increases by 1.

## Amp

Your insubstantiality is complete enough that you can pass through other creatures, causing painful interference effects when you do so. Once each round when you [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), [Burrow](../../rules/actions/burrow.md), [Swim](../../rules/actions/swim.md), or [Fly](../../rules/actions/fly.md), you can pass through one creature's space during that action without needing to attempt a check to [Tumble Through](../../rules/actions/tumble-through.md), though you can't end your turn in its space. When you pass through a creature's space in this way, you deal `2d6` force damage to that creature, with a basic Fortitude save.

**Amp Heightened (+ 2)** Increase the damage dealt by phasing through a creature by `1d6`.
