# Telekinetic Bombardment *Spell 7*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst or 30-foot line
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

You grasp a piece of the landscape—such as a tree, carriage, or piece of masonry—and lob it in your foe's direction. Your missile crashes down in either a 10-foot burst (for most missiles) or a 30-foot line (for something long and tall, like a tree or a ship's mast), dealing `14d6` bludgeoning damage and turning its area into difficult terrain as it breaks into rubble. All creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save. If the area is a line, it doesn't have to start from your square but can instead start anywhere in range, as long as the entire area remains within range.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and is [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6`.
