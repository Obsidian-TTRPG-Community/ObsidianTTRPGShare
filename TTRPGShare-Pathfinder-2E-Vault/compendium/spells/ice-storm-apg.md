You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an icy deluge. When you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), a burst of magical hail deals `2d8` bludgeoning damage and `2d8` cold damage to each creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder of the spell's duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one. As normal, if a big creature is in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the continuing damage once per turn.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The initial bludgeoning damage and cold damage increase by `1d8` each, and the cold damage creatures take at the end of their turns increases by 1.
