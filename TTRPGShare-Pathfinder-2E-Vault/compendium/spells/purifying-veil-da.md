Drawing on the purifying powers of water, you call forth a veil of fine water droplets suffused with holy energy. The veil surrounds the target. Everything on each side of the veil is [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from creatures on the opposite side, but the water doesn't impede attacks or movement across the veil. If the target moves through the veil, it takes `4d6` good damage with a basic Will save. If the target leaves the veil, the spell ends.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The good damage increases by `1d6`.
