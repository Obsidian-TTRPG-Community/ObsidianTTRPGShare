- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature that isn't on its home plane
- **Saving Throw** Will

You send the target back to its home plane. The target must attempt a Will save. You can spend an extra action while [Casting this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) and add a material component to give the creature a –2 circumstance penalty to its save. The component must be a specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature, and not from a spell component pouch. This spell fails if you aren't on your home plane when you cast it.

> [!success-degree]

> - **Failure** The target is banished.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is banished and can't return by any means to the plane it's banished from for 1 week.

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures. The extra material component affects targets to which it is anathema.
