# Unfolding Wind Rush *Focus 3*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

You travel on a rushing wind. Move two times: two [Strides](../../rules/actions/stride.md), two [Steps](../../rules/actions/step.md), or one [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) and one [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) (in either order). You can [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) or [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) into the air during this movement, moving upward at a 45-degree angle at most; if you end your movement in the air, you fall after taking one action or when your turn ends, whichever comes first. A [wall of wind](wall-of-wind.md) appears in all the spaces you left during this movement, lasting for 1 round.

**Heightened (5th)** The wall of wind lasts 3 rounds.
