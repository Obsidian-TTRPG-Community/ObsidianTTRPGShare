You cloud the target's mind and daze it with a mental jolt.

The jolt deals mental damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; the target must attempt a basic Will save. If the target critically fails the save, it is also [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
