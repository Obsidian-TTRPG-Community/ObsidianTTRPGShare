# Ooze Form *Spell 3*   
[polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You invoke all things that seep and ooze, your body dissolving into a thick slurry and then reconstituting itself into a Medium ooze battle form. When you first cast this spell, choose black pudding, gelatinous cube, gray ooze, or ochre jelly. While in this form, you gain the [ooze](../../rules/traits/ooze.md) trait. You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 7 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 20 temporary Hit Points.
- You are immune to critical hits, precision damage, and [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) effects.
- Resistance 5 to acid, piercing, and slashing damage.
- No vision and motion sense 30 feet. You can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement as a precise sense.
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +14, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +14, unless your own is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the ooze:
- **Black Pudding** Speed 15 feet, climb 15 feet; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") pseudopod, **Damage** `2d6+5` bludgeoning and `1d8` acid.
- **Gelatinous Cube** Speed 15 feet; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") cube face, **Damage** `1d6+5` acid; a creature hit by your cube face [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or be [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) (or [paralyzed](../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round on a critical failure); this save has the [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md) trait.
- **Gray Ooze** Speed 15 feet, climb 15 feet, swim 15 feet; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") pseudopod, **Damage** `1d6+5` bludgeoning and `1d6` acid, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.
- **Ochre Jelly** Speed 15 feet, climb 10 feet; resistance 5 to electricity; **Melee** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") pseudopod, **Damage** `1d8+5` bludgeoning and `1d8` acid, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.
