# Vital Beacon *Spell 4*   
[healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [positive](../../rules/traits/positive.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Duration**until your next daily preparations

Vitality radiates outward from you, allowing others to supplicate and receive healing. Once per round, either you or an ally can use an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to supplicate and lay hands upon you to regain Hit Points. Each time the beacon heals someone, it decreases in strength. It restores `4d10` Hit Points to the first creature, `4d8` Hit Points to the second, `4d6` Hit Points to the third, and `4d4` Hit Points to the fourth, after which the spell ends. You can have only one vital beacon active at a time.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The beacon restores one additional die of Hit Points each time it heals, using the same die size as the others for that step.
