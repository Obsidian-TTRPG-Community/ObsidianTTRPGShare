- **Duration**unlimited (see below)

You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, on the targeted creature or object. The mark can be visible or [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible), and you can change it from one state to another by using an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to touch the target. The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of work. If it's on a creature, it fades naturally over the course of a week. The time before the mark fades increases depending on your heightened level.

**Heightened (3rd)** The sigil instead fades after 1 month.

**Heightened (5th)** The sigil instead fades after 1 year.

**Heightened (7th)** The sigil never fades.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
