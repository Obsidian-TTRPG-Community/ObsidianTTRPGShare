# Remove Fear *Spell 2*   
[enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature

With a touch, you ease a creature's fears. You can attempt to counteract a single [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effect that the target suffers from.

This frees only the target, not any other creatures under the [fear](../../rules/traits/fear.md) effect.

**Heightened (6th)** The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
