# Prestidigitation *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**10 foot
- **Targets**1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
- **Duration**sustained

The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md) effects for as long as you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md). Each time you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can choose one of four options.

- **Cook** Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
- **Lift** Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
- **Make** Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile—it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
- **Tidy** Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less

You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.

Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md).

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
