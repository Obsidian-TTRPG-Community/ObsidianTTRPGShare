# Angelic Wings *Focus 3*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [light](../../rules/traits/light.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**3 rounds

Wings of pure light spread out from your back, granting you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your wings cast bright light in a 30-foot radius. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as feather fall.

**Heightened (5th)** The duration increases to 1 minute.
