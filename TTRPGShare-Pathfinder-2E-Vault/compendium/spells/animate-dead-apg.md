Your magic dredges up a corpse or skeleton and fills it with necromantic life, and you force the dead to fight at your command. You summon a common creature that has the [undead](../../rules/traits/undead.md) trait and whose level is –1; this creature gains the [summoned](../../rules/traits/summoned.md) trait. Heightening the spell increases the maximum level of creature you can summon.
