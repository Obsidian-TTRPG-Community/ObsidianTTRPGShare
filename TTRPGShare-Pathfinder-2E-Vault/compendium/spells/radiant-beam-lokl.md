# Radiant Beam *Spell 4*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [good](../../rules/traits/good.md)  [light](../../rules/traits/light.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**120-foot line
- **Saving Throw**  basic Reflex

You fire a beam of blinding light from your outstretched hands. The beam deals `5d10` good damage. On a failed saving throw, a creature becomes [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round, or [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 4 rounds on a critical failure.

If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, radiant beam attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the target.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d10`.
