# Divine Aura *Spell 8*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [aura](../../rules/traits/aura.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**10-foot emanation
- **Targets**allies in the area
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

Divine power wards the targets, granting each a +1 status bonus to AC and saves while in the area.

Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. The bonuses granted by the spell increase to +2 against attacks by—and effects created by—creatures with an alignment opposite to the spell (lawful if you chose chaotic, evil if you chose good). These bonuses increase to +4 against effects created by such creatures that attempt to impose the [controlled](../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled) condition on a target of your divine aura, as well as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything opposite in alignment to your divine aura.

When a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute. It's then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

The first time you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) each round, the divine aura's radius grows 10 feet.
