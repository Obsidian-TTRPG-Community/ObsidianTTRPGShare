# Invisibility Sphere *Spell 3*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**10-foot emanation
- **Targets**you and any number of creatures in range
- **Duration**10 minutes

You and all targets are [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) except to each other as long as you remain within the spell's area. If a creature made [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature made [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) by this spell uses a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, the spell ends after the [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action is completed.

While exploring, it's easy to move together slowly and remain [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible). This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until at most the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends.

**Heightened (5th)** The duration increases to 1 hour.
