# Knock *Spell 2*   
[transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 door, lock, or container
- **Duration**1 minute

You make the target easier to open. Knock grants a +4 status bonus to any creature that tries to open the target door, lock, or container with an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) or a [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check. You can attempt a [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check to open the target as part of casting knock, and you add your level even if you're untrained.

Knock counteracts lock.
