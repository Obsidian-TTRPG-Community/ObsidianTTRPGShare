# Waking Dream *Focus 4*   
[enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You cloud the target's mind with vivid, dreamlike imagery, so they have difficulty distinguishing real threats from imagined ones.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is distracted by the visions and treats all other creatures as [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) for 1 round, and you can't [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) to increase the duration.
> - **Failure** The target is [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused). In addition to the creatures present, the target might also attack wildly at thin air, attempting to fend off the dreams. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the confusion.
>
>    Even if the [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) effect ends early, the target treats all other creatures as [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target gets no save to end the effect early.
