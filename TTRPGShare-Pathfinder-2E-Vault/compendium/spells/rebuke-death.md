- **Domains**: [[healing](../setting/domains.md#Healing)]
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Area**20-foot emanation
- **Targets**1 living creature per action spent to cast this spell

You snatch creatures from the jaws of death. You can spend 1 to 3 actions [Casting this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), and you can target a number of creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains `3d6` Hit Points. If the target had the [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition, coming back from [dying](../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) due to this healing doesn't increase its [wounded](../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the healing by `1d6`.
