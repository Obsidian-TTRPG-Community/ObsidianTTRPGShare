# Symphony Of The Unfettered Heart *Focus 5*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [composition](../../rules/traits/composition.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**you or 1 ally

Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns.

Attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check to counteract one of the following conditions affecting the target: [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained), [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed), or [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned). If you fail, you can't target that effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) DC for [grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed)).

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to four creatures.
