# Sudden Blight *Spell 2*   
[necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude

You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living creature in the area takes `2d10` negative damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature afflicted by a disease takes a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.

You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment. Sudden blight attempts to counteract any [magical](../../rules/traits/magical.md) effect on the plants before withering them.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d10`.
