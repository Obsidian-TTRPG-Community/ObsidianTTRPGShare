# Pied Piping *Focus 10*   
[bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [composition](../../rules/traits/composition.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**5-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

Your performance enraptures those who hear it, compelling them to follow you about in admiration. Each creature within the emanation must attempt a Will save when you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) or the first time they enter the area, after which they become temporarily immune for 1 day. Once per turn, you can spend a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [fascinated](../../rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) with you.
> - **Failure** The creature uses all its actions to move toward you and compliment your performance. This effect ends if a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action is used against the affected creature.
> - **Critical Failure** The target gains the minion trait and is [controlled](../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you. This effect ends if a [hostile](../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action is used against the affected creature, or if you direct the creature to use any action that causes it harm.
