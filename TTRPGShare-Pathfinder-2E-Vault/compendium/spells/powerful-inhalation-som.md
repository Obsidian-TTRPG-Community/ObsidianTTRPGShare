# Powerful Inhalation *Focus 3*   
[air](../../rules/traits/air.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**10-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude

You rapidly draw the air from your surroundings, hoarding it for yourself. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take `5d6` bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails its save can't speak above a raspy whisper for 1 round. A creature that critically fails can't speak or use abilities that require it to breathe for 1 round. This prevents it from using effects that require speech, such as casting spells with verbal components, and from using a breath weapon or similar ability.

Creatures made of air (such as air elementals) attempting a save against this spell get a degree of success one worse than they rolled.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage by `2d6`.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
