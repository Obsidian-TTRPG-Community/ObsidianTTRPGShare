[conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 

You enhance a summoned creature with the power of the elements. If your next action is to cast either [summon animal](summon-animal.md) or [summon plant or fungus](summon-plant-or-fungus.md), choose [air](../../rules/traits/air.md), [earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md), [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md), or [water](../../rules/traits/water.md), and the creature you summon gains the corresponding abilities.

- **Air** The creature gains a fly Speed of 60 feet.
- **Earth** The creature gains a burrow Speed of 20 feet, reduces its land Speed by 10 feet (minimum 5 feet), and gains resistance 5 to physical damage.
- **Fire** The creature's attacks deal `1d6` extra fire damage, and it gains resistance 10 to fire and weakness 5 to cold and water.
- **Water** The creature gains a swim Speed of 60 feet, can spend 1 action after a melee attack to attempt a [Shove](../../rules/actions/shove.md) (ignoring multiple attack penalty), and gains resistance 5 to fire.
