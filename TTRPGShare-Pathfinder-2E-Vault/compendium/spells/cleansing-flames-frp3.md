You wrap the target in purifying flames. You can attempt to counteract a single poison or non-curse effect imparting the [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled), [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), [fatigued](../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued), [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [paralyzed](../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [sickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), or [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition.

The target can choose to empower the flames with their life force, becoming [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) (or increasing their [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) value by 1, if already under the condition) to grant you a +1 circumstance bonus to your counteract check.
