# Winter Bolt *Focus 1*   
[attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)  [cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Domains**: [[cold](../setting/domains.md#Cold)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You fling a hollow icicle filled with winter's wrath. Make a spell attack against a target within range. The bolt deals `1d8` piercing damage and lodges in the target. At the end of the target's next turn, the bolt shatters, releasing a whirl of snow and ice that deals `1d12` cold damage to the target and all adjacent creatures. The bolt can be removed with an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action, which causes it to melt harmlessly without detonating.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The initial bolt deals full damage and is especially well anchored, taking 2 [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) actions to remove. The bolt's explosion deals double damage.
> - **Success** The bolt and its explosion deal full damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d8` and the secondary damage increases by `1d12`.
