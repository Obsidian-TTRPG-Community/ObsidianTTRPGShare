# Crisis Of Faith *Spell 3*   
[enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You assault the target's faith, riddling the creature with doubt and mental turmoil that deal `6d6` mental damage, or `6d8` mental damage if it can cast divine spells. The effects are determined by its Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage; if the target can cast divine spells, it's [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [stupefied](../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round, and can't cast divine spells for 1 round. To many deities, casting this spell on a follower of your own deity without significant cause is anathema.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6` (or by `2d8` if the target is a divine spellcaster).
