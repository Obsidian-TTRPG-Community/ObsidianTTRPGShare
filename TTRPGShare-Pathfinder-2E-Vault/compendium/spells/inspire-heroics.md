# Inspire Heroics *Focus 4*   
[bard](../../rules/traits/bard.md)  [enchantment](../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [metamagic](../../rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [F](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 

You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide to your allies with your inspire courage or inspire defense composition. If your next action is to cast [inspire courage](inspire-courage.md) or inspire defense, attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check.

The DC is usually a very hard DC of a level equal to that of the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your inspire courage or inspire defense composition depends on the result of your check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The status bonus from your inspire courage or inspire defense increases to +3.
> - **Success** The status bonus from inspire courage or inspire defense increases to +2.
> - **Failure** Your inspire courage or inspire defense provides only its normal bonus of +1, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
