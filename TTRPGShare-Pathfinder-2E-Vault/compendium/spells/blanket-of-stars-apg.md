# Blanket Of Stars *Spell 6*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**10 minutes

A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md). While outside under a starry night sky, you're also [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) as long as you remain still. When moving under a starry night sky, you are [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) instead.

Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md) effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of its next turn.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [confused](../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) and [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of its next turn.
