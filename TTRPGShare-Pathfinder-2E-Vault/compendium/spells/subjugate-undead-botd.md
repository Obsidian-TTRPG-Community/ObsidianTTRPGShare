# Subjugate Undead *Focus 3*   
[mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**one undead creature with a level of no more than your level – 4
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You attempt to seize control of the target. It can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If the target is already being [controlled](../../rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by another creature, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw and the undead uses the better result. Casting subjugate undead again ends any previous subjugate undead you cast.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The undead creature becomes a [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md) under your control for 1 minute. The spell is dismissed if you or an ally takes a hostile action against the [minion](../../rules/traits/minion.md) undead.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 10 minutes.
