# Coral Eruption *Spell 4*   
[conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**two 10-foot bursts that don't overlap
- **Saving Throw**  basic Reflex
- **Duration**1 minute

Razor sharp coral growths erupt from the ground, transforming the landscape into a dangerous coral reef.

You can create a third nonoverlapping burst if the centers of all three bursts are underwater. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take `6d6` piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain.

A creature that moves through the area takes 3 piercing damage for every square of that area it moves into.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The initial piercing damage increases by `3d6`, and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1.
