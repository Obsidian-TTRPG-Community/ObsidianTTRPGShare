# Lose The Path *Spell 1*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A creature in range [Strides](../../rules/actions/stride.md).
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**the triggering creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You surround a moving creature with lifelike illusions, shifting their perception of the terrain to subtly lead them off course. The target must attempt a Will save.

Regardless of the result, the creature is immune to lose the path for 1 hour.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature treats all squares as difficult terrain for its [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except that you determine where the target moves during the [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md), though you can't move it into hazardous terrain or to a place it can't stand.
