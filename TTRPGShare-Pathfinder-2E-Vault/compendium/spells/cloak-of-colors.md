# Cloak Of Colors *Spell 5*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**1 minute

A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes a brilliant flash of light. A creature that hits the target with a melee attack must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The attacker is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The attacker is [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The attacker is [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round. The creature is temporarily immune until the end of its turn; this effect has the [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md) trait.
