# Pocket Library *Spell 1*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [extradimensional](../../rules/traits/extradimensional.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Duration**24 hours

You collect information from the world's libraries about a particular subject and store it in an extradimensional library.

When you [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), choose any skill in which you are at least trained that has the [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action.

During the duration of this spell, you can call forth a tome from the extradimensional library when attempting a [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check using your chosen skill. This is part of the action to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). You must have a hand free to do so. The tome appears in your hand, open to an appropriate page. This grants you a +1 status bonus on the [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead. If the roll is successful and the subject is a creature, you gain additional information or context about the creature. Once you reference a book from your pocket library, the spell ends.

**Heightened (3rd)** The status bonus increases to +2 and you can reference your pocket library twice before the spell ends.

**Heightened (6th)** The status bonus increases to +3 you can reference your pocket library three times before the spell ends.

**Heightened (9th)** The status bonus increases to +4 and you can reference your pocket library four times before the spell ends.
