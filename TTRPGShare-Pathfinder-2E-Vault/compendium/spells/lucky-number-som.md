- **Cast** 10 minutes 
- **Duration**until the next time you make your daily preparations

When you [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), roll `1d20` and make a note of the result. You gain the following reaction; once you use the reaction, the spell ends, and you become temporarily immune to lucky number until the next time you make your daily preparations.

That's My Number! [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") (divination, fortune) Trigger You roll your lucky number as your d20 result on a non-secret attack roll, saving throw, or skill check; Effect You call upon the fortune stored within your lucky number and reroll the triggering check. However, pushing your luck has a price: if your result on the reroll is the same number again, you critically fail, regardless of what degree of success you ordinarily would have received.
