You summon an ancient Fleshforged, one of Nex's personal weaponized monstrosities unleashed in the first wars against Geb. It squeezes itself into its war form from time long forgotten, unleashing its wrath upon your foes.

The Fleshforged occupies the space noted in the spell description. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the Fleshforged below to summon.

- Bone Breaker Size Gargantuan, Speed 40 feet, climb 100 feet; Arrive Skull Breaking Hum (evocation, sonic) The Bone Breaker appears in a shower of bone fragments. Its form is that of an immense titan of flesh and metal with long, muscular, twisted arms. The Bone Breaker releases a hum at a harmonic frequency that weakens bones in creatures' bodies. Each foe within an 80-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save. On a critical success, they're unaffected; on a success, they're [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round; on a failure they're [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute; and on a critical failure, they're [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 10 minutes. A skeleton or other undead foe made almost entirely of bones treats their result as one degree of success worse than they rolled. Depart Bruising Departure The Bone Breaker pounds its long arms into the ground, creating a long shockwave. Each foe within a 100-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line takes `8d12` bludgeoning damage, with a basic Fortitude save.
- Thorn Caller Size Gargantuan, Speed 100 feet; Arrive (evocation, light) Thorn's Guidance The Thorn Caller appears in a burst of light. The Thorn Caller's body is an ornate armored sphere with black panther masks surrounding a glowing light. The ball floats in the air due to six glowing, thornlike wings. Two clusters of bird heads emerge from both sides of the body with long necks that twirl together like tentacles. The Thorn

Caller's burst of light illuminates all foes within 200 feet. The foes become [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) and [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed), and if they were [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible), they become [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) instead.

These effects last until the Thorn Caller departs.

Depart Thorn-Burst The Thorn Caller launches its thorned wings at various targets. Attempt spell attack rolls against up to 6 different targets within 300 feet.

On a hit, the target takes `10d8` piercing damage, double on a critical hit, half on a failure, and none on a critical failure.

- The Thousand Size Medium (see below), Speed 30 feet; Arrive (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) Disconcerting Arrival Select five spaces in range and summon a Medium-sized polyp of The Thousand in each of these spaces. The Thousand is an entity whose full scope is 1,000 polyps of oozing flesh, each physically separate but mentally part of a single creature. Not all 1,000 polyps have survived, and the spell summons five of them. Each creature within 10 feet of any of the polyps must attempt a Will Save. On a critical success, they're unaffected; on a success, they're [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened); on a failure, they're [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened); and on a critical failure, they're [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [fleeing](../../rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) for 1 round; Depart (illusion, mental) Violent Omen Each [frightened](../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) foe within a 60-foot emanation of any of the five polyps takes `10d8` mental damage, with a basic Will save.
- Scion of Desiccation Size Gargantuan, Speed 100 feet, fly 100 feet; Arrive (necromancy, negative) Ashes to Ashes The Scion of Desiccation appears in a swirl of screaming wind, a gargantuan form of twisted flesh that's constantly flensed by gritty ash and dust, and just as constantly regenerating itself. Each foe within a 40-foot emanation takes `10d10` negative energy damage, with a basic Fortitude save; Depart (necromancy, negative) Dust to Dust Each foe within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save; they're [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) on a failure or [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) on a critical failure.
