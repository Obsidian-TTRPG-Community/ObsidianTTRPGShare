# Corrosive Body *Spell 7*   
[acid](../../rules/traits/acid.md)  [polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You exhale corrosive gas, and acidic secretions coat your skin as you transform into a being of living acid. You gain acid immunity. Any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or non-reach melee weapon takes `3d6` acid damage, and your unarmed attacks deal `1d4` additional acid damage. The first time each round that you deal acid damage to a creature in this way, you gain `3d6` temporary HP as your body digests the eroded material and transforms it into a protective acid. When the spell ends, any remaining temporary HP expires as well. Your acid.
