# Path of Least Resistance *Focus 4*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

You trace several possible routes, quickly resetting the timeline until you find the safest one. Choose three spaces you could reach with two [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) actions. Each must be at least 20 feet from the other two. You [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) twice to one of the spaces, determined randomly by the GM from among the paths you chose. If some of the paths contain a [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) danger, such as a trap that you would trigger by walking into the trap's affected area, the GM doesn't consider this path when randomly determining which one you take, but if all options have a [hidden](../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) danger, the GM randomly chooses between all three paths. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.
