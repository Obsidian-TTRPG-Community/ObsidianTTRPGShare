- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Area**5-foot emanation or more
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

You unleash your ki as a powerful storm of force and lightning, dealing `2d6` force damage and `2d12` electricity damage to creatures in the area. If you use 2 actions to cast the spell, increase the size of the emanation to 10 feet and the damage to `3d6` force damage and `3d12` electricity damage. If you use 3 actions to cast the spell, increase the size of the emanation to 20 feet and the damage to `4d6` force and `4d12` electricity damage. Each creature attempts one basic Reflex save that applies to both types of damage On a failed save, the creature is [deafened](../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 round; on a critical failure, the creature also takes `2d12` [persistent electricity damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [deafened](../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The force damage increases by `1d6` and the electricity damage by `1d12`, or `2d6` and `2d12` if you use 2 or 3 actions.
