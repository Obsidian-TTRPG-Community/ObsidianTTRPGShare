# Nudge Fate *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [hex](../../rules/traits/hex-apg.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [witch](../../rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Patron** Witch
- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You read slightly into the future and give fate a tiny push to achieve the result you desire. Once during the duration, when the target fails an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw and a +1 status bonus would turn a critical failure into a failure, or failure into a success, you grant the target a +1 status bonus to the check retroactively, changing the outcome appropriately. The spell then ends, and the target is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

If you cast [nudge fate](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/nudge-fate-apg.md) while a previous casting of this hex is still in effect, the previous effect ends.
