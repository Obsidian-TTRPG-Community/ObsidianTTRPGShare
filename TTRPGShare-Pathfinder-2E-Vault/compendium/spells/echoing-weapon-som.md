# Echoing Weapon *Spell 1*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [sonic](../../rules/traits/sonic.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 weapon
- **Duration**1 minute

You channel magical energy into the target weapon, and the air around it faintly hums each time you strike a blow, as the impact is absorbed into the weapon. If a creature is wielding the weapon at the end of its turn, the weapon discharges a burst of sound targeting one creature adjacent to the wielder (if any). The sonic damage this deals is equal to the number of successful [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the target weapon that the wielder made that turn (to a maximum of 4 sonic damage if the wielder hits with four [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md)).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The sonic damage increases by 1 per [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) (and the maximum damage increases by 4).
