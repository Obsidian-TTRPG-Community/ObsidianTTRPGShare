# Disappearance *Spell 8*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**10 minutes

You shroud a creature from others' senses. The target becomes [undetected](../../rules/conditions.md#Undetected), not just to sight but to all senses, allowing the target to count as [invisible](../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) no matter what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still possible for a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.
