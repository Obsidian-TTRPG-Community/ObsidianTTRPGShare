You extend your senses through a multitude of crawling and flying creatures. You create a crawling swarm in your square.

You can hear through the swarm as if using your normal auditory senses. The first time you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) each round, you can move the swarm 10 feet along the ground in any direction.
