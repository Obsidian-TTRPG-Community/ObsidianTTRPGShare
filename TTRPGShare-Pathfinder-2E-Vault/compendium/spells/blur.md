- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature

The target's form appears blurry. It becomes [concealed](../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed). As the nature of this effect still leaves the target's location obvious, the target can't use this concealment to [Hide](../../rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../rules/actions/sneak.md).
