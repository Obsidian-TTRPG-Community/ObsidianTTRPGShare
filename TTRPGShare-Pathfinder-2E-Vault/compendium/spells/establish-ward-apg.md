# Establish Ward *Focus 5*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [sorcerer](../../rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You bind a part of your essence to your surroundings, creating a warded area that grants you power within it, but drains you outside of it. While within the area, you can make nature's wrath [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) by commanding plants, wind, rocks, and other natural features to attack enemies. These are melee [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that use your spell attack modifier, can target any creature within the ward, and deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage equal to `2d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

Upon [Casting the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can immediately make a single nature's wrath [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). You are [quickened](../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) while inside the ward, and can use the additional action only to make nature's wrath [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md). You are [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) while outside the area.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The area increases by 5 feet, and the [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deal an additional `1d8` damage.
