# Consecrate Flesh *Spell 3*   
[good](../../rules/traits/good.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Through the strength of your faith, your body becomes infused with holy energy. You have weakness 5 to evil. Any creature that touches or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon takes `1d6` good damage.

Your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1 good damage. Your healing spells that restore Hit Points restore an additional `1d4` Hit Points when you initially cast them; as normal, if your healing spell restores Hit Points more than once, grants fast healing, or the like, the additional Hit Points still only apply once.

**Heightened (+ 3)** Creatures touching you take `1d6` additional good damage, your unarmed [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deal 1 additional good damage, your healing spells restore `1d4` more additional Hit Points, and your weakness to evil increases by 5.
