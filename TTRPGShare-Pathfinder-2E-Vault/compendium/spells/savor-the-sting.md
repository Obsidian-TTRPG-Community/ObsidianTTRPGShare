- **Domains**: [[pain](../setting/domains.md#Pain)]

- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You inflict pain upon the target and revel in their anguish. This deals `1d4` mental damage and `1d4` [persistent mental damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage); the target must attempt a Will save. As long as the target is taking [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this spell, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks against the target.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and no [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The target takes full initial and [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double initial and [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d4` and the [persistent damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by `1d4`.
