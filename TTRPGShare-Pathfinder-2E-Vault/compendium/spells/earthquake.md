# Earthquake *Spell 8*   
[earth](../../rules/traits/earth.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Area**60-foot burst
- **Duration**1 round

You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and collapse structures.

The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass of quicksand.

- **Shaking Ground** The ground is difficult terrain, and creatures on it take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks.
- **Fissures** Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require DC 15 [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) to [Climb](../../rules/actions/climb.md).
- **Collapse** Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals `11d6` bludgeoning damage; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage.
> - **Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls [prone](../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.

**Heightened (10th)** You create a massive earthquake that can devastate a settlement. The range increases to half a mile and the area to a quarter-mile burst.
