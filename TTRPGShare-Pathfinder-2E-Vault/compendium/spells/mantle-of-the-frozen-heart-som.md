# Mantle Of The Frozen Heart *Spell 5*   
[cold](../../rules/traits/cold.md)  [morph](../../rules/traits/morph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You surround yourself in a mantle of frigid ice magic, and your skin and armor morph into cold blue ice. Freezing air emanates from your body, sending a chill down anyone's spine who draws too close and leaving a fine dusting of frost in your wake. Upon Casting this Spell, pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.

- **Chilling Ice** The ice around your body thickens, melting off to protect you from heat while inuring you from the cold. You gain resistance 10 to cold.
- **Heart of Ice** Your body temperature plummets to blistering cold. Any creature that touches you, or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon attack, takes `2d6` cold damage.
- **Ice Glide** Ice trails from your feet for an instant as you move, allowing you to skate rapidly along the ice. You don't need to [Balance](../../rules/actions/balance.md) on ice, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow. While moving along a smooth surface, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your land Speed.
- **Icy Claws** Your hands morph into vicious, piercing claws of ice useful for attacking or climbing. As long as you have both hands free, you gain a climb Speed equal to your land Speed. You gain a claw unarmed attack with the [agile](../../rules/traits/agile.md) and [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md) traits, in the brawling weapon group. Your claw attack deals `1d6` piercing damage as its base damage, plus an additional `2d6` cold damage.
