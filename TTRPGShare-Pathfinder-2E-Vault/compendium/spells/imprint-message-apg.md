You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts object reading (page 222) on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a [retrocognition](retrocognition.md) spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.

If the object is targeted with read aura of a higher spell level than imprint message, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of imprint message fade.
