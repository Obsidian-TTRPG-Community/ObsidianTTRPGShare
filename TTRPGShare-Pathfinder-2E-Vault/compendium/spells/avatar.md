- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You transform into an avatar of your deity, assuming a [Huge](../../rules/traits/huge-b1.md) battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost.

You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions. You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) this spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which deity's battle form you assume:

- AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 30 temporary Hit Points.
- [Darkvision](../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- One or more attacks specific to your deity's battle form, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +33, and you use the listed damage. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purposes of the [enfeebled](../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example) unless they have the [finesse](../../rules/traits/finesse.md) trait, and all ranged attacks are Dexterity based. Attacks that deal positive or negative damage don't heal creatures.
- [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +35, unless your own is higher.

You also gain the specific abilities listed for your deity below:
