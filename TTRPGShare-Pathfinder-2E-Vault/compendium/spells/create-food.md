# Create Food *Spell 2*   
[conjuration](../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** 1 hour 
- **Range**30 foot

You create enough food to feed six Medium creatures for a day. This food is bland and unappealing, but it is nourishing.

After 1 day, if no one has eaten the food, it decays and becomes inedible. Most Small creatures eat one-quarter as much as a Medium creature (one-sixteenth as much for most Tiny creatures), and most Large creatures eat 10 times as much (100 times as much for Huge creatures and so on).

**Heightened (4th)** You can feed 12 Medium creatures.

**Heightened (6th)** You can feed 50 Medium creatures.

**Heightened (8th)** You can feed 200 Medium creatures.
