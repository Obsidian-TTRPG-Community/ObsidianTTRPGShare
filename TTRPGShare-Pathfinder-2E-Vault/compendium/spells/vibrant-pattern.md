# Vibrant Pattern *Spell 6*   
[illusion](../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [incapacitation](../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [visual](../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity.

Creatures are [dazzled](../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) while inside the pattern.

In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) or [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action on the pattern. A creature currently [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [blinded](../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute.
