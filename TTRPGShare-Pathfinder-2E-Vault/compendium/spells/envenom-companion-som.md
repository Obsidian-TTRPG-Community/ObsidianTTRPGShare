# Envenom Companion *Spell 3*   
[necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [poison](../../rules/traits/poison.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**your companion or eidolon
- **Duration**1 minute

You envenom your companion or eidolon's attacks, which drip with highly toxic venom for the spell's duration. The first time each round the target hits a creature with an unarmed [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) that deals piercing or slashing damage, that [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d8` poison damage. A creature that is damaged by this poison must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, it's also [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round.

This spell can't target familiars.

**Heightened (+ 3)** The poison damage increases by `1d8` and the [clumsy](../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) value imposed on a failed save increases by 1.
