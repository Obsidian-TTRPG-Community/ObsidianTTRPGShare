# Blood Feast *Spell 5*   
[necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature

Your head splits vertically into an enormous maw, which feasts upon the target's blood, dealing `12d6` piercing damage, depending on your spell attack roll. After the spell, your head sews back together as if it had never split apart. You gain temporary Hit Points for 1 minute equal to half the piercing damage the target takes.

If you are a gug, increase the piercing damage by `2d6` and increase the [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you deal on a critical hit by `1d8`. This spell doesn't alter a gug's appearance.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature takes double damage and `1d8` [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Success** The creature takes full damage.
> - **Failure** You miss and the creature takes no damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The piercing damage increases by `2d6`, and the [persistent bleed damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a critical increases by 1.
