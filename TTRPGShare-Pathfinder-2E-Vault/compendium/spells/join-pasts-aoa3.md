With touches to the targets' foreheads, you bring them into mental communion. The targets can share thoughts and experiences, but not words. When one target attempts to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), the other can [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) the first target's skill check, using any [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) skill (even if that [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) wouldn't normally apply) without having made any preparations to [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md).

**Heightened (+ 1)** You can touch one additional target to include them in the spell's effects. Multiple targets can attempt checks to [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) the target who is attempting to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).
