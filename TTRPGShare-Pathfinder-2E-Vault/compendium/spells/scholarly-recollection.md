- **Domains**: [[knowledge](../setting/domains.md#Knowledge)]
- **Cast** [R](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You attempt a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check to [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md), or you attempt a skill check to [Recall Knowledge](../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) with a skill you're trained in.
