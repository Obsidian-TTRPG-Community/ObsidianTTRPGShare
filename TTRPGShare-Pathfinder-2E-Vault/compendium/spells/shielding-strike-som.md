# Shielding Strike *Focus 1*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [magus](../../rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

As you attack a foe, warding magic transforms your momentum into action and lifts your shield. Make a melee [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md). You can then either [Raise your Shield](../../rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) if you're wielding one or cast [shield](shield.md) if you have the spell.
