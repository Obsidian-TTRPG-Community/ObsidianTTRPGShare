You ward an area to alert you when creatures enter without your permission. When you cast [alarm](), select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature enters the spell's area without speaking the password, alarm sends your choice of a mental alert (in which case the spell gains the [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) trait) or an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains the [auditory](../../rules/traits/auditory.md) trait). Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check to wake up. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check against the spell's DC or trigger the spell when moving into the area.

**Heightened (3rd)** You can specify criteria for which creatures sound the [alarm]() spell—for instance, orcs or masked people.
