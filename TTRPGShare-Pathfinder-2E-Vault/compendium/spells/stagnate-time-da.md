- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst

You examine the time stream in a particular area, then proceed to stick a few metaphorical pins into it, thickening and slowing down the flow of time until it rumbles along like a river of molasses. Any creature that begins its turn in the area must attempt a Will save.

> - **Failure** The creature is [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) this turn.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [slowed](../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) this turn.
