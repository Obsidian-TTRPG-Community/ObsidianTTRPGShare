# Goodberry *Focus 1*   
[druid](../../rules/traits/druid.md)  [healing](../../rules/traits/healing.md)  [necromancy](../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 ripe berry
- **Duration**10 minutes

You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to regain `1d6+4` Hit Points. A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.

**Heightened (+ 1)** You can target an additional berry. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action.
