# Magnetic Acceleration *Spell 3*   
[attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature or object

You magnetize a small metal object, such as a nail or coin, and launch it away from you at massive speed. Make a ranged spell attack roll; if the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll with magnetic acceleration. On a hit, the target takes `3d6` bludgeoning damage and `3d6` piercing damage, or double damage on a critical hit.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The bludgeoning and piercing damage each increase by `1d6`.
