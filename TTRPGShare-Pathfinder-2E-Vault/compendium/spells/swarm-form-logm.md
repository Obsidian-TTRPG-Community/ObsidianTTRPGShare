# Swarm Form *Focus 4*   
[polymorph](../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Domains**: [[swarm](../setting/domains.md#Swarm)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**5 minutes

You discorporate into a swarm of Tiny creatures. While in swarm form, you have the [swarm](../../rules/traits/swarm-b1.md) trait and you gain resistance 5 to slashing and piercing damage and weakness 5 to area and splash damage. You can fit into spaces only a few inches wide, moving your constituent creatures through the gap.

You don't gain the swarm mind ability, so you are still affected normally by [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects. As a swarm, you can't speak, cast spells, use manipulate actions requiring your hands, activate your magic items, or make any of your [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with your normal body. You can [Dismiss](../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the Spell.

**Heightened (+ 2)** Increase your resistances and weaknesses each by 5.
