# Spiritual Weapon *Spell 2*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [force](../../rules/traits/force.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

A weapon made of pure magical force materializes and attacks foes you designate within range. This weapon has a ghostly appearance and manifests as a club, a dagger, or your deity's favored weapon.

When you cast the spell, the weapon appears next to a foe you choose within range and makes a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against it. Each time you [Sustain the Spell](../../rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can move the weapon to a new target within range (if needed) and [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) with it. The spiritual weapon uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.

The weapon's [Strikes](../../rules/actions/strike.md) are melee spell attacks. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to `1d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other statistics or traits of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual weapon is a weapon for purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.

The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md), and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to it.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The weapon's damage increases by 1d8.
