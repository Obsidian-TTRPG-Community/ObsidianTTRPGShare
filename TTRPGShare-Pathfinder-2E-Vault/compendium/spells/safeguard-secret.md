# Safeguard Secret *Focus 4*   
[abjuration](../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [cleric](../../rules/traits/cleric.md)  [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[secrecy](../setting/domains.md#Secrecy)]
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Range**10 foot
- **Targets**you and any number of willing allies
- **Duration**1 hour

You ensure a secret remains safe from prying spies. Choose one piece of information that at least some of the targets know; you can target a creature only if it remains within range for the full minute during which you [Cast the Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md). The spell grants those who know the piece of knowledge you have chosen a +4 status bonus to skill checks (typically [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks) to conceal this knowledge and to saving throws against spells that specifically attempt to obtain this knowledge from them and effects that would force them to reveal it.

If you [Cast this Spell](../../rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) again, any previous safeguard secret you had cast ends.
