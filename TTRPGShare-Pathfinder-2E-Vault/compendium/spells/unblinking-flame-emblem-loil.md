# Unblinking Flame Emblem *Focus 7*   
[divination](../../rules/traits/divination.md)  [fire](../../rules/traits/fire.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Trigger**Your last action was a successful [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy.
- **Duration**3 rounds

You emblazon the target with a fiery sigil that projects your sight and your flame onto them, allowing you and your allies to track their movements and making it easier to hit them.

Attack rolls against the target gain a +1 status bonus, and successful Strikes against the target deal `1d6` fire damage, and `1d10` [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a critical hit. However, you're [flat-footed](../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against other enemies, as the information from the emblem distracts you. The emblem takes your full attention; if you use unblinking flame emblem again before the original duration expires, the new casting replaces the previous casting.

**Heightened (9th)** The fire damage increases to `1d8`, and the [persistent fire damage](../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a critical hit increases to `1d12`.
