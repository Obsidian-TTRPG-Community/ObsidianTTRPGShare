- **Domains**: [[ambition](../setting/domains.md#Ambition)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**10 minutes

You strengthen a target's ambition, increase its resentment of allies, and make its allegiances more susceptible to change.

The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to its saving throws and other defenses against attempts to [Coerce](../../rules/actions/coerce.md) it, [Request](../../rules/actions/request.md) something of it, or use [mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects to convince it to do something (such as a [suggestion](suggestion.md) spell). This penalty applies only if the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.
> - **Failure** As success, but the penalty is –2.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is overcome with ambition, taking whatever actions would advance its own agenda over those of anyone else, even without attempts to convince it.
