[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [water](../../rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

A wave of flowing water rushes behind you like an elegant river, pushing you across the battlefield with fluid grace.

You [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md) up to 50 feet. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can make a [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) at any point during your [Stride](../../rules/actions/stride.md). If your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the wave flows after you to batter the target of your [Strike](../../rules/actions/strike.md) as well, dealing `2d10` bludgeoning damage and pushing it 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
