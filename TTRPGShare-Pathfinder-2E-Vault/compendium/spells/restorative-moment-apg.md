You manipulate the threads of time around the target, giving them some of the benefits of a day's passage. The target decreases the values of any [doomed](../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) and [drained](../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) conditions it has by 1 and can immediately attempt one saving throw against each affliction it has with a stage length of 1 day or less. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
