# Telekinetic Rend *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](../../rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [psychic](../../rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  [uncommon](../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**2 non-overlapping 5-foot bursts
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude

Your mind creates a violent axis of motion in a nearby space. You deal your choice of `1d6` bludgeoning or `1d6` slashing damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Fortitude save. A creature large enough to be in more than one of the bursts takes damage only once.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.

## Amp

Your thoughts expand in scope and power. The bursts deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage and `1d6` slashing damage, instead of the usual damage. A creature that critically fails its save is also [stunned](../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Amp Heightened (+ 2)** Both types of damage increase by `1d6` instead of just one. Add a third non-overlapping 5-foot burst to the area.
