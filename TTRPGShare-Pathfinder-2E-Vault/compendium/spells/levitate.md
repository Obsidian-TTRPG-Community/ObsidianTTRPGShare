# Levitate *Spell 3*   
[evocation](../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 unattended object or willing creature
- **Duration**5 minutes

You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.

For the duration of the spell, you can move the target up or down 10 feet with a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can spend an [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
