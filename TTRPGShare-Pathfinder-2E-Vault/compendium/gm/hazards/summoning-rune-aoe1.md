# Summoning Rune *Hazard 5*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +12 trained  

An [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) cloud of magical sensors detects living creatures in the room and summons fire elementals to slay the creatures.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) (trained) to approach without triggering the trap, followed by DC 22 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to erase the rune or dispel magic (3rd level; counteract DC 20) to counteract the rune.

title: Summon Elementals [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [conjuration](../../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  summon  

- **Trigger**: A living creature enters the room

**Effect** Two rounds after a creature enters the room, the room's door slams shut and locks (two DC 20 [Thievery](../../../compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks to pick), and two cinder rat fire elementals emerge from the floor. The elementals roll initiative and remain for `3d6` rounds, after which the spell ends and the creatures disappear. The elementals also disappear if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned elementals can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.

**Reset** The trap resets each day at dawn.
