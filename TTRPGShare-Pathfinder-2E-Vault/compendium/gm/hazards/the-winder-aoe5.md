title: Routine
(1, 2, or 4 actions, depending on the encounter's threat level) The Winder uses each of its actions to Wind clockwork assassins in the room, starting with inactive ones.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Wind [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The Winder winds a clockwork creature in the room. If the creature is currently inactive, this activates the creature, allowing it to act normally for `1d4` rounds.

If already active, this instead increases the number of rounds the clockwork creature remains active by `1d4`.
