title: Routine
(4 actions) For each aurochs skull disabled or destroyed, the haunt has 1 fewer action. On each action, a different aurochs moves up to 60 feet and attempts a horn [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a different living creature. A creature critically hit by a horn [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) also takes `2d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is knocked [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
