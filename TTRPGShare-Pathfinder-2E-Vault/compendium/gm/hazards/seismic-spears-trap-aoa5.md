A creature struck by a seismic spear is [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round as their body shakes uncontrollably.

On a critical hit, a target must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or be [petrified](../../../rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 1 minute, or permanently on a critical failure.
```

**Reset** The trap resets after 1 minute.
