# Cracked Earth *Hazard 3*  
[environmental](../../../rules/traits/environmental.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 22 trained  

This 20-foot-by-20-foot patch of ground is cobwebbed with cracks and fissures that crumble when a creature steps on it.

- **Disable** DC 16 [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) (untrained) to collapse safely; DC 20 [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) (trained) to shore it up enough to pass over without collapsing it

title: Long Fall [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature steps onto the cracked earth

**Effect** The creature fractures the thin crust of earth and falls through. That creature can use the [Grab an Edge](../../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) reaction to avoid falling, as long as it is adjacent to an edge. Otherwise it takes falling damage (typically 25 bludgeoning damage for a 50-foot drop). Some of these rifts eventually lead to the Darklands.
