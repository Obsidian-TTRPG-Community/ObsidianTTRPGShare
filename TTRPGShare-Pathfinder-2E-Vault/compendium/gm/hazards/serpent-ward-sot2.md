# Serpent Ward *Hazard 7*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 expert  

Illusionary snakes erupt from the trapped door, inflicting a venomous curse on intruders.

- **Disable** DC 26 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (expert) or DC 24 [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (expert) to deactivate the magical trigger.

[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Trigger**: The trapped door is opened other than by a serpentfolk

**Effect** Hissing, illusionary snakes leap from the door. Each living creature within 30 feet is subjected to the curse of potent poison. If a living creature opened the door, that creature must roll its saving throw against the curse twice and take the worse result (this is a [misfortune](../../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect).
