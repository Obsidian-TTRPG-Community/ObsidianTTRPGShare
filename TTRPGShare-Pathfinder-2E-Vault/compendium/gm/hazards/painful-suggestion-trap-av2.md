# Painful Suggestion Trap *Hazard 8*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 26 expert  

A [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) rune on the floor under the filth, just past the threshold, triggers an ersatz ghost.

- **Disable** DC 28 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to remove the rune without triggering it, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 26) to dispel the rune.

- **Trigger**: A living creature moves over the rune

**Effect** A frightful moan echoes through the room, and a hoarse telepathic voice shouts, "Get out!" This shout deals `6d12` mental damage to creatures in the room (DC 26 basic Will save). Creatures who fail this saving throw must immediately leave the room and can't willingly reenter it for 1 minute (1 hour on a critical failure).

**Reset** The trap automatically resets after 1 hour.
