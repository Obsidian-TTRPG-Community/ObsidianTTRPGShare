# Freezing Alarm *Hazard 20*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 43 master  

Miniature snowflake-shaped glyphs on the ground cause a layer of ice to ripple over the floor of the room and sound a silent alarm.

- **Disable** DC 51 [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) (legendary) to draw a fiery counteracting glyph over each snowflake, or dispel magic (9th level, counteract DC 48)

[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [cold](../../../rules/traits/cold.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature enters one of the three squares marked with a T on the map

**Effect** The floor of the entire 10-foot-by-15-foot antechamber freezes over, sending deadly magical frost creeping up the legs of the intruders. Any creatures standing in the room must roll a DC 45 Reflex save. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature takes `3d10+5` cold damage. Failure The creature takes `6d10+10` cold damage and is [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for `1d4` rounds. Critical Failure The creature takes `12d10+20` cold damage and is [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute. Additionally, the golems in area B10 become aware of the intruders. The golems activate and come to this room to attack, if they haven't been destroyed already.
