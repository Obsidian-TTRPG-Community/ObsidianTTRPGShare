# Crushing Gate Trap *Hazard 16*  
[trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 42 master to spot the triggering rod beneath the black sand.  

A [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) stone rod causes two immense stone doors to fall forward from their gate, crushing anything beneath them. The doors also fall forward if touched.

- **Disable** [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC 42 (expert) to secure the doors in place without triggering the trap.  

- **AC** 40 , **Fort** +32, **Ref** +25
- **Hardness** 26, **HP** 104 (BT 52)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses**

title: Gate Collapse [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[attack](../../../rules/traits/attack.md)  

- **Trigger**: The stone rod is moved or either door is touched

**Effect** The two falling doors deal `6d12+35` bludgeoning damage (DC 37 basic Reflex save) to all creatures within 15 feet of the gate. On a failure, a creature is also pinned beneath the door and [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until the door is moved (DC 34 [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics)) or destroyed; each door has the same AC, Fortitude save, Hardness, and Hit Points as the trap itself. On a critical failure, the creature is trapped in such a way that it can't attempt to free itself. Moving or destroying one door doesn't help free anyone trapped by the other door.
