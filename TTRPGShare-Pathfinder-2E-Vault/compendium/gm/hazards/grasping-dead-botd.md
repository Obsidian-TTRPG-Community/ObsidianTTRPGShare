```ad-embed-ability
title: Shifting Earth [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: At least two creatures enter the area

**Effect** The earth shifts wildly as the hands of the dead spring forth from the ground. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures within the area are knocked [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone) unless they succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save. The haunt then rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) The grasping hands batter all creatures in the area, dealing `2d6+7` bludgeoning damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature is dragged partially into the earth, becoming [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it [Escapes](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) (DC 26). If already [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), it's fully submerged and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation.
```
^routine

**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all living creatures leave the area. After 1 hour, the haunt reactivates.
