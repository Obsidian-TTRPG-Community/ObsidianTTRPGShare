```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled sensor. On each action, the trap causes a random 10-foot-by-10-foot space in the arena to suddenly freeze.

Each creature that begins its turn in a frozen space takes `2d6+2` cold damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save). A creature that critically fails its save also becomes [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round; if it was already [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed), the creature instead becomes [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round. Any amount of fire damage dealt to a [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) or [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) creature removes the condition. Frozen tiles become unfrozen at the beginning of the trap's next turn.
