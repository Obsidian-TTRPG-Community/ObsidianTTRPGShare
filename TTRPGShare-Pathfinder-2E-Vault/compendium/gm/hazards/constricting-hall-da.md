# Constricting Hall *Hazard 8*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 31  

A hall's four walls become fluid and elastic when a creature reaches the hall's midpoint.

- **Disable** DC 28 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to stabilize each wall, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 26) to counteract each wall

[occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature reaches the hall's midpoint

**Effect** The hall's walls lose their rigidity, becoming fluid and elastic. The hall becomes difficult terrain, and each creature in the hall is knocked [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone) unless they succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save. The trap then rolls initiative.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(4 actions) This trap loses 1 action each round for each wall that has been disabled. Each wall uses 1 action to slam back and forth rapidly, pummeling one creature in the hall with a wall [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, the target is additionally knocked [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). The walls distribute the attacks as evenly as possible among creatures in the hall, and the [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) don't apply the trap's multiple attack penalty.
