title: Explosive Catalyst [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: Slick drinks Gattlebee's growth serum (page 36)

**Effect** The giant lizard bumps into lab tables and workbenches, causing dangerous ingredients to intermix and detonate. The hazard rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) A random 10-foot square in Gattlebee's laboratory explodes, dealing `2d6` damage to creatures and objects in the area (DC 18 basic Reflex save). The damage type is randomly determined each round: acid, cold, electricity, fire, slashing, or sonic.
```

**Reset** The lab contains enough ingredients for this hazard to last 1 minute before all materials are expended.

Alternatively, the hazard resets once Slick shrinks to regular size (see below).
