# Blood Tears *Hazard 10*  
[haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 32 master to notice your vision tint red  

A wailing spirit appears and gouges their own eyes. As they do, blood seeps from the eyes of those who witness the act, obscuring their vision.

- **Disable** DC 30 [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) (master) to talk the spirit out of gouging its eyes or DC 32 [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (trained) to ease the spirit's sorrows
