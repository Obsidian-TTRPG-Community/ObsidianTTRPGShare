# Weight of Guilt *Hazard 7*  
[haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 30 expert to sense an oppressive aura of sorrow  

Influenced by the guilt and regrets of the dead, creatures are wrapped in weighted chains that embody their own sins.

- **Disable** DC 26 [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (expert) to disrupt the haunt through prayer or DC 27 [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) (expert) to openly defy your regrets and banish the haunt. Creatures who haven't committed sins or already made amends for their transgressions are immune to the effects of this haunt.
