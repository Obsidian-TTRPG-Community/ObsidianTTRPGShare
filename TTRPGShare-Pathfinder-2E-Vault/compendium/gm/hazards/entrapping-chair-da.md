- **AC** 22 , **Fort** +15, **Ref** +9

```ad-embed-ability
title: Take a Seat! [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature steps on the track

**Effect** The chair rockets forward along the track and slams into the triggering creature, dealing `3d8+15` bludgeoning damage. A creature who succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save takes no damage and moves out of the chair's path into a random adjacent square not containing the track.

A creature who fails this saving throw is knocked into the chair's seat and immediately captured by the armrests, becoming [grabbed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) ([restrained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) on a critical failure; [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) DC 26).
```

**Reset** The trap resets automatically over 2 rounds if the chair is unoccupied.
