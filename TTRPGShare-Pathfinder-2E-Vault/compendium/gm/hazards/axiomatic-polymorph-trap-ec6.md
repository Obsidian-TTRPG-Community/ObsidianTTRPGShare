# Axiomatic Polymorph Trap *Hazard 20*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 47 master  

A Utopian glyph transforms trespassers into aeons.

- **Disable** DC 48 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (master) to drain the glyph's power harmlessly, or dispel magic (9th level; counteract DC 42) to counteract the glyph.

- **Trigger**: A creature moves within 10 feet of the entryway to the Hall of Wonders (area **N4**) without speaking the passphrase ("The History and Future of Humanity") in Utopian.

**Effect** Each creature within 20 feet of the door is targeted by baleful polymorph (DC 42 Will save), except the effect transforms creatures into the form of an arbiter aeon rather than that of an animal.
