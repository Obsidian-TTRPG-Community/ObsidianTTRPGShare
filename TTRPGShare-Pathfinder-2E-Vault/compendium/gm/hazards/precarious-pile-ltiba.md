title: Collapse [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature attempts to climb or remove an object from the wall or the wall suffers a forceful impact

**Effect** The wall collapses, dealing `2d8` bludgeoning damage to creatures on it or within 10 feet of it. A creature that succeeds at a DC 18 Reflex save takes half damage and rolls out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, they take no damage and can choose the direction.
