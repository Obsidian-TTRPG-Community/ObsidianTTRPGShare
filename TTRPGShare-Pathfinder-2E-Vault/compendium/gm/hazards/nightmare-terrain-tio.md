# Nightmare Terrain *Hazard 6*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 22 [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) to detect the subtle magical aura of the land.  

What seems like an innocent stretch of land assaults trespassers with terrible illusions.

- **Disable** [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) DC 22 (by a hero with expert proficiency in that skill) three times to temporarily disrupt the magic, or dispel magic (3rd-level spell, DC 25)

If a creature that can see moves 10 feet into the affected area, the hazard rolls [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) (+16) for its initiative.
