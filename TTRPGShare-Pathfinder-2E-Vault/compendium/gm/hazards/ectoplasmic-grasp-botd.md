# Ectoplasmic Grasp *Hazard 5*  
[haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 23 trained to notice ectoplasm coalescing  

A massive ectoplasmic hand forms around a creature and squeezes it.

- **Disable** DC 24 [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (trained) to send the ectoplasm back to the Ethereal Plane or DC 26 [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) to move through and disrupt the coalescing ectoplasm before it takes hold

- **Trigger**: A creature moves over the haunt's area

**Effect** The hand forms out of ectoplasm and squeezes the triggering creature, dealing `3d8+14` bludgeoning damage (DC 22 basic Fortitude save). On a failure, the creature is [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) ([Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) DC 22).
