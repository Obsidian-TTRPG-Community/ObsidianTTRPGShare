- **Trigger**: The desk switch is pressed or the trapdoor is opened

**Effect** The charge on the door explodes. All creatures within 10 feet take `2d10+6` fire damage, `1d10+3` piercing damage, and `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) (DC 22 basic Reflex save). The room is filled with steam, making all creatures within the room [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed). The trap then rolls initiative.
