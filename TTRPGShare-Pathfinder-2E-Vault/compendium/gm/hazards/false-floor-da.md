# False Floor *Hazard 3*  
[illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 23 (trained; or 0 if the illusory floor is dispelled)  

The floor in this chamber is an illusion, which conceals a 40-foot drop to the true floor below. Additionally, the area beneath the floor is magically silenced—no sound is audible within nor does sound leave this space.

- **Disable** Succeeding on a [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check against the [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) DC of 21 (including the check to find the trap) disbelieves the illusory floor, or dispel magic (2nd level; counteract DC 18) to dispel the illusory floor; dispel magic (2nd level; counteract DC 20) to dispel the magical silence

title: Drop [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature walks onto the illusory floor

**Effect** The triggering creature falls through the illusory floor and takes falling damage (typically 20 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the [Grab an Edge](../../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) reaction to avoid falling. The DC to [Climb](../../../rules/actions/climb.md) the walls or [Grab an Edge](../../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) is 20.
