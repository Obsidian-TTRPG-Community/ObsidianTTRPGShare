- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +20 expert or DC 30 (expert) to notice the three launching mechanisms built into the wall.

- **AC** 31 , **Fort** +24, **Ref** +15
- **Hardness** 20, **HP** 80 (BT 40) per launching mechanism
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses**
