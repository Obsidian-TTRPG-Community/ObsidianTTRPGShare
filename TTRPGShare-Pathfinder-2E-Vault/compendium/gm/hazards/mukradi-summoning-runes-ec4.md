# Mukradi Summoning Runes *Hazard 15*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +25 master to notice runes marked on the floor.  

Barely visible runes are etched into the stone floor in a 20-foot diameter circle.

- **Disable** DC 36 [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) to approach without triggering the trap followed by DC 34 [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (expert) or DC 38 Thievery(master) to erase the rune, or dispel magic (8th level; counteract DC 34) to counteract the rune..

[conjuration](../../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md)  summon  

- **Trigger**: A creature enters the circle without uttering the passphrase, "Praise to the Water Lizard"

**Effect** The trap summons a mukradi (Bestiary 239). The mukradi rolls initiative and remains for 1 minute, after which the spell ends and the mukradi disappears. The mukradi also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The mukradi can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.

**Reset** The trap resets at the first high tide of each day.
