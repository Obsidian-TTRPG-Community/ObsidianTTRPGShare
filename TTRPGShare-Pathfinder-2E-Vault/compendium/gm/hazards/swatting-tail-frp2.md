# Swatting Tail *Hazard 18*  
[environmental](../../../rules/traits/environmental.md)  [kaiju](../../../rules/traits/kaiju-frp2.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 10  

Mogaru's tail sweeps forth, causing an arc of devastation in a 60-foot cone.

- **Disable** DC 45 [Performance](../../skills.md#Performance) (legendary) or DC 48 [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) (legendary) to momentarily divert Mogaru's attention.  
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Tail Swat [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature takes a [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against Mogaru, produces a visible area effect, or flies within 120 feet of Mogaru

**Effect** Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save or take `6d10+28` bludgeoning damage. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature takes half damage and is pushed 20 feet away. If flying, it descends 20 feet. Failure The creature takes full damage, is pushed 40 feet, and descends 60 feet (if flying) or is knocked [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone). Critical Failure The creature takes double damage, is pushed 60 feet away, descends 120 feet (if flying) or is knocked [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and is [stunned](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
```

**Reset** Mogaru doesn't swat his tail again for `1d4` rounds.
