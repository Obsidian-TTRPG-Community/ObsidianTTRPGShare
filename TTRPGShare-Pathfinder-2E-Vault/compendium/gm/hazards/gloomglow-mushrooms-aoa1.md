title: Glowing Spores [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature moves into the mushrooms' space or damages the mushrooms.

**Effect** The mushrooms can't use this reaction if the damage was cold damage. The triggering creature and all creatures within 10 feet are sprayed with itchy, distracting, glowing spores and must attempt a DC 22 Reflex save. On a failed save, the creatures become [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) (or [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical failure) and take a –4 penalty to [Stealth](../../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks until the spores lose potency in 24 hours or are removed. This requires washing them off by bathing in water for a minute, a [prestidigitation](../../../compendium/spells/prestidigitation.md) spell, or a similar measure allowed by the GM.
