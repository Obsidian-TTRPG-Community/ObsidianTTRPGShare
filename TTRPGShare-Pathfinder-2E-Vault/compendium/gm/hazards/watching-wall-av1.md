# Watching Wall *Hazard 4*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +12 expert  

An overwhelming feeling of being watched wells up in the minds of those in the room, an instant before an eerie red eye opens in the western wall.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) (trained) to appear uninteresting to the watching eye (and thus be ignored by it) or DC 22 [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (trained) to ward against being seen by or affected by the eye.  

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) The eye glances about, and those it can see (whether in area C4 or outside of it) take `4d6` mental damage (DC 21 basic Will save) as fears of being watched impart ripples of pain. A creature that takes mental damage from this effect doesn't reduce their [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value at the end of their next turn.
```
^routine

**Reset** The haunt becomes inert at the end of any round in which there are no [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creatures it can see.

It stays dormant for 1 hour, after which point it resets.
