[attack](../../../rules/traits/attack.md)  

When someone pulls the trip wire, the urn smashes against a creature in the doorway, making a shattering urn [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against that creature, then releases a viper (page 32) into the square that contained the trap. The viper attacks any non-plant creature it detects.
