```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) When it's triggered, the trap has five active nozzles, but at the end of its turn each round, one random nozzle deactivates. On the trap's turn, the active nozzles emit a cloud of acidic poison gas that expands to fill the apartment. The cloud deals `1d6` acid damage and `1d6` poison damage per active nozzle to each creature and object in the room (DC 33 basic Fortitude save). Unattended objects automatically fail saves to avoid the damage.
