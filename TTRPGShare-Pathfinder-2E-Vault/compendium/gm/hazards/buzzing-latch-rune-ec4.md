- **Trigger**: A creature attempts to open the door without using the key

**Effect** The trap makes a loud buzz and deals `5d10` electricity damage and `5d10` sonic damage to the triggering creature (DC 32 basic Reflex save; this save applies to both the electricity damage and the sonic damage). Further, the creature must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save. Critical Success No effect. Success The target is [paralyzed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round. Failure The target is [paralyzed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for `1d4` rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new DC 32 Fortitude save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, or end it entirely on a critical success. Critical Failure The target is [paralyzed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Fortitude save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, or end it entirely on a critical success.
