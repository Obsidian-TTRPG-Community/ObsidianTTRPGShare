**Reset** The trap runs out of darts after 4 rounds of firing and must be reset manually by dismantling the walls to reload the launchers. If at any point there are no longer more than two creatures placing weight on the floor, the trap ceases firing but remains armed, ready to resume firing its remaining darts once triggered again.
