# Images Of Failure *Hazard 12*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 35 expert to realize the illusory images conceal a magical trap (noticing the images has a DC of 0)  

Psychically enhanced illusions flood the minds of creatures in the 40-foot-long, 15-foot-wide hallway (the white dotted box on the map) with memories of their past failures.

- **Disable** DC 32 [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (master) or dispel magic (5th level; counteract DC 26) to weaken the images; three successes are required to disable the trap.

[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature ends a move action within the trap's area

**Effect** The triggering creature takes `2d10+10` mental damage (DC 32 basic Will save) as it recalls its past failures. A creature that takes damage hears a soft whisper offering, "Let me take something from you and I can stop the pain." A creature who agrees loses access to a random skill feat that isn't a prerequisite for another feat, and the creature doesn't take further damage from.

This effect lasts for 1 week and can be ended by effects that remove curses.
```

**Reset** The trap resets immediately and can affect the same creature multiple times on the creature's turn.
