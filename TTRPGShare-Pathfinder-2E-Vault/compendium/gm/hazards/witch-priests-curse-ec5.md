# Witch-priests' Curse *Hazard 18*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 42 expert  

Anyone who opens a secret compartment is subjected to a powerful curse.

- **Disable** DC 39 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (legendary) to carefully remove the bone fetish that holds the curse.

- **Trigger**: A creature opens a secret compartment

**Effect** The creature must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or be subjected to the witch-priests' curse. Whenever a cursed creature takes at least 10 piercing or slashing damage from a single attack, it also takes `3d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). In addition, the cursed creature regains only half as many Hit Points as normal from all healing. The effect is permanent unless removed by magic.

**Reset** The trap resets if both secret compartments are shut.
