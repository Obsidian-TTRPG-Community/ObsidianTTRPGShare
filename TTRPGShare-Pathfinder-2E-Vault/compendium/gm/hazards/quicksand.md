# Quicksand *Hazard 3*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [environmental](../../../rules/traits/environmental.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +12 trained (or –10 and no minimum proficiency if the surface is disturbed)  

A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts to submerge creatures that step onto it.

- **Disable** [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) DC 18 (trained) to disturb the surface.  
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Submerge [F](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: A Huge or smaller creature walks onto the quicksand.

**Effect** The triggering creature sinks into the quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it hasn't already.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature. that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation.

A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Swim](../../../rules/actions/swim.md) to either raise itself by one step if it's submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it's submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone) in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can [Aid](../../../rules/actions/aid.md) the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 20 [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check.
```
^routine

**Reset** The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but the surface doesn't become [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) again until it settles over the course of 24 hours.
