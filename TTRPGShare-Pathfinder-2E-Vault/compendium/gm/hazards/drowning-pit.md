# Drowning Pit *Hazard 3*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [mechanical](../../../rules/traits/mechanical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +10 trained DC 22 (expert) to notice the water spouts once the pit opens.  

A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that's 30 feet deep and has 5 feet of water at the bottom. Four water spouts in the walls connect to [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) water tanks. Each water spout extends out of a different wall, 6 inches from the top of the pit.

- **Disable** [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC 18 (trained) to seal each water spout,

- **Trigger**: A creature walks onto the trapdoor.

**Effect** The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically 12 bludgeoning damage). A creature can [Grab an Edge](../../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) to avoid falling. The trapdoor then slams shut, and the hazard rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled water spout. On each of the trap's actions, a spout pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet.

Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but creatures in the pit begin drowning.
```

**Reset** The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged and the water tanks refilled; it can be reset without draining the pit, but doing so renders it less effective.
