# Stonescale Spirits *Hazard 2*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +11 trained  

A half-dozen ghostly kobolds rise from the rubble in a howling vortex.

- **Trigger**: A creature enters a square either fully or partially filled with rubble in the middle of the room

**Effect** Six ghostly kobolds surge out of the rubble with eerie yowls. Each creature in area A7 must attempt a DC 18 Will save with the following results. The haunt then rolls initiative.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected, is temporarily immune to Confusing Confrontation for 24 hours, and realizes that a display of intimidating dominance might quell the ghostly kobolds' assault.
> - **Success** The creature is [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The creature is [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 round and is [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 2 rounds and is [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened)

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) The spirits swoop together toward one creature in area A7 who's [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), instilling feelings of betrayal and confusion. The target takes `1d10+4` mental damage (DC 18 basic Will save).
```
^routine

**Reset** The haunt deactivates if there are no [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creatures in area A7 at the start of its turn. The ghostly kobolds return to the rubble pile. The haunt can't activate again for 1 hour.
