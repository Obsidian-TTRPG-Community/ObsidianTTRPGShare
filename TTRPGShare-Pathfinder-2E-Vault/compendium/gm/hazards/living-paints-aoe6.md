# Living Paints *Hazard 19*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 41 (Master)  

A mass of brushes use magical paint to convert creatures into art.

- **Disable** DC 41 [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) (master) to mix the paints into bland, useless colors, DC 46 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (legendary) to dismantle the animated brushes, or dispel magic (8th level; counteract DC 41) to counteract the magic within the paint.

- **Trigger**: A creature steps into the same space as the paints (the square marked with a "T" on the map on page 26)

**Effect** The brushes animate and attempt to paint all creatures within 30 feet. The creatures must succeed at a DC 41 Reflex save to avoid the brushes and splashes from paint cans or be converted into living artwork for 1 hour. A creature that becomes living artwork is immediately bound to the nearest flat surface of its size or larger within 30 feet. The creature can move only along flat surfaces such as floors and walls. This allows it to end its movement wrapped around corners when on a continuous surface. While bound to a surface, the creature can attack from its space as normal, including against other creatures bound to the same surface. If the surface it's on is destroyed (such as a portrait hit by a [fireball](../../../compendium/spells/fireball.md) spell or a wall being demolished), the creature takes `10d6` damage and is shunted to the nearest flat surface. If there is no flat surface within 5 feet, the creature is destroyed.
