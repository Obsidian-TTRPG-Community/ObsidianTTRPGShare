- **Trigger**: A creature steps onto the trap's pressure plate (indicated on the map)

**Effect** The front of the iron maiden slams shut with incredible force and locks itself. The triggering creature takes `4d10+10` piercing damage and `2d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) (DC 26 basic Reflex save; if the creature critically succeeds, they avoid the trap completely). The triggering creature is also [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized). The victim can end their immobilization only once a creature outside the iron maiden unlocks the device (requiring two successful DC 28 [Thievery](../../../compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks.

[Disable a Device](../../../rules/actions/disable-a-device.md)) or breaks the iron maiden, after which the trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 check to [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) the trap's spike-lined interior.
```

**Reset** The pressure plate must be reset manually.
