# The Laughing Fiend's Greeting *Hazard 20*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 46 legendary  

Subtle but deadly magical runes link this mural to Kharnas's master. Good- or neutral-aligned creatures who examine the mural witness the castle's drawbridge silently descend, revealing an endless darkness.

- **Disable** DC 44 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (legendary) to obscure or mar the magical runes set into the mural, or dispel magic (9th level; counteract DC 42) to counteract the mural.

- **Trigger**: A creature capable of casting divine magic examines the mural

**Effect** The mural casts weird (DC 43 Will save) on all creatures in the gallery. A snarl fills the creatures' minds.
