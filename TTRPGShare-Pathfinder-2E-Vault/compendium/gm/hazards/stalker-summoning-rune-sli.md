# Stalker Summoning Rune *Hazard 7*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +15 expert  

The sand conceals a rune that summons an [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) stalker into this yard.

- **Disable** [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) DC 25 to approach without triggering the trap followed by [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) DC 25 (expert) or [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC 27 (expert) to erase the rune, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 25) to counteract the rune.

title: Summon Monster [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [conjuration](../../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  summon  

- **Trigger**: A creature that isn't openly bearing an Aspis Consortium badge crosses the center of the yard.

**Effect** The trap summons an invisible stalker. The invisible stalker rolls initiative and remains for `2d6` rounds, after which the spell ends and the [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) stalker disappears. The [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) stalker also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) stalker can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
