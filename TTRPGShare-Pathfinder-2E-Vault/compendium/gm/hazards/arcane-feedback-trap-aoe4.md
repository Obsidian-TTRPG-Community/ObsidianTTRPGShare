# Arcane Feedback Trap *Hazard 13*  
[arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 35 expert  

A spike of stone bursts from the south wall and quickly retracts.

- **Disable** DC 33 [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) (master) to quell the rippling stone or dispel magic (7th level, counteract DC 31) to dispel the magical feedback.

[arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [earth](../../../rules/traits/earth.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature in area E1 casts an arcane spell or uses an arcane ability

**Effect** The trap makes a stone spike attack against the triggering creature. For the next 1 minute thereafter, the ripples are stronger, giving the trap a +2 circumstance bonus on stone spike [Strikes](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) during this time.
