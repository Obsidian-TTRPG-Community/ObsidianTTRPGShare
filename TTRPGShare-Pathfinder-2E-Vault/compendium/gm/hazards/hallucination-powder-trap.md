Any creature in the cone must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 round and take a –2 status penalty to [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks and saves against [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md) effects for `1d4` hours. On a critical failure, the penalty is instead –4.
