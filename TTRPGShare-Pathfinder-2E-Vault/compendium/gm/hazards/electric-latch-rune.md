[electricity](../../../rules/traits/electricity.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 20 trained  

An [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) rune imprinted on a door latch releases a powerful electric discharge.

- **Disable** [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC 20 (expert) to scratch out the rune without allowing electricity to flow, or dispel magic (2nd level; counteract DC 18) to counteract the rune.
