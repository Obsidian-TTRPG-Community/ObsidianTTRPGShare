- **Disable** [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC 41 (expert) at four different junctions to jam all the saw blade's possible paths, preventing it from traveling through the room.  

- **AC** 43 , **Fort** +32, **Ref** +32
- **Hardness** 30, **HP** 120 (BT 60) per junction
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

- **Weaknesses**

- **Trigger**: A creature attempts to exit the room.

**Effect** The saw blade travels along its path, making one [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against each creature in the room, twisting and varying its height for a maximum chance of beheading its targets.

title: Decapitation

On a critical hit, a target must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or be decapitated, [dying](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dying) instantly unless it can survive without a head.
```

**Reset** The trap resets over the course of the round and can be triggered again 1 round later.
