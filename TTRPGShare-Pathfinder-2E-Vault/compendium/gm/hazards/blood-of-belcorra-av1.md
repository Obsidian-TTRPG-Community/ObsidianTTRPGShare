- **Trigger**: A living creature ends its turn in area A11 at night

**Effect** A ghastly image of Belcorra, seemingly composed of fresh blood, rises from the bloodstain on the floor and rotates in place like a lighthouse. Beams of cold blue light shine from Belcorra's eyes and open mouth, causing blisters and decay to spread across flesh. Living creatures within a 30-foot burst from the center of area A11 must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. The haunt then rolls initiative. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature takes `1d8` negative damage. Failure The creature takes `1d8+6` negative damage and is [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. Critical Failure The creature takes `2d8+6` negative damage and is [blinded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round then [dazzled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.

title: Routine
(1 action) The bloody image opens its mouth and appears to inhale, drawing blood from the body of one creature in its line of sight within 90 feet from the center of area A11. The creature targeted must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save.

**Reset** If the haunt is disabled or destroyed through damage, the bloody phantom of Belcorra sprays upward in a spiral, dousing the trap door leading to area A25 before draining upward through the keyhole, which reduces the [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC to Pick the Lock to 20. At the next sunrise, the blood drains back down to this room and the haunt resets. The haunt is destroyed permanently once Lasda Venkervale is rescued from area D9.
