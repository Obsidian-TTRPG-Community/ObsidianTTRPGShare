```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) Each round on its initiative count, the trap pumps more sleeping gas into the room. Any breathing creature in the room is exposed to the toxin.

If a creature acts before the trap on the first round, it has the option of holding its breath to postpone breathing in the poison—holding one's breath after the trap's first action has no effect, since the air in the creature's lungs is already tainted. The trap functions for 1 minute before all the gas is expended, after which it rapidly decays over the next minute. Opening the door to an adjacent room cuts the remaining time it takes for the gas to decay in half but exposes creatures in that room as well.

**Reset** The gas must be manually reloaded.
