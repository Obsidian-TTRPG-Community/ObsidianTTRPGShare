# Final Words *Hazard 4*  
[haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 22 trained to hear the scratch of a quill upon paper  

As a creature touches a hand-written letter, they witness the letter's author scribe it in the past; each pen stroke across the page carves the letter's text into the creature's flesh.

- **Disable** DC 24 [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (trained) to ward off the haunt or DC 25 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to dispose of the letter with extreme care before the haunt can form

- **Trigger**: A creature reads the letter

**Effect** The haunt deals `2d8+11` slashing damage to the triggering creature as the words are carved into its flesh (DC 21 basic Will save). On a failure, the creature takes `2d8` [persistent bleed damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
