# Desperate Hunger *Hazard 12*  
[haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 35 master to feel an odd sense of hunger  

A skeletally thin spirit appears, weeping as it shoves earth and stones down its throat in an effort to stave off hunger.

- **Disable** DC 36 [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) (master) to convince the spirit it's no longer hungry or DC 38 [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (trained) to ritually feed the spirit

[occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature approaches within 10 feet

**Effect** Creatures within 30 feet are filled with painful hunger and must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude save or feel their stomachs fill with rocks, dirt, and worse, dealing `6d10+20` piercing damage.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for as long as it's [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
