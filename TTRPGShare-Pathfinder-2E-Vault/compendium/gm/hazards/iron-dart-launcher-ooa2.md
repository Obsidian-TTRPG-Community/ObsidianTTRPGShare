# Iron Dart Launcher *Hazard 4*  
[mechanical](../../../rules/traits/mechanical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 expert  

A half‑dozen iron darts fire from spring‑loaded launchers [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) in the desk opposite the front door.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to disable the trigger, or DC 18 [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) to squeeze through the partially opened door (this doesn't disable the trap but prevents it from triggering)  

- **AC** 22 , **Fort** +14, **Ref** +8
- **Hardness** 10, **HP** 50 (BT 25)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses** 
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Dart [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: The front door is fully opened, Forced Open, or [broken](../../../rules/conditions.md#Broken)

**Effect** A hail of iron darts launches along a 20‑foot line from the desk through the doorway, dealing `4d8+10` piercing damage to each creature in the area of effect (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
```

**Reset** The trap resets as soon as the door is closed. It has enough darts to trigger three times, after which, it must be reloaded with 20 darts before it can reset again.
