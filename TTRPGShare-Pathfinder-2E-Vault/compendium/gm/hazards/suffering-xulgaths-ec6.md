- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +26 expert to hear the echoed shouts of panicked xulgaths.  

The shadows of four xulgaths endlessly relive their deaths at the hands of the wendigos and their clutchmates.

On a character's first successful check, the character also learns that xulgath funerary rites typically involve cremation, which hints that fire is a viable way to put them to rest.
