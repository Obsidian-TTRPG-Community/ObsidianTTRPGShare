- **Disable** DC 17 [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (trained) to weaken the spirit, DC 18 [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) (trained) to force the spirit's face back inside the wall, or DC 19 [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) (trained) to talk down the spirit; two total successes across all skills are required to disable the haunt  

- **AC** 15 , null
- **Hardness** 9 (wall); **HP** 30 (BT 15)

- **Trigger**: A creature moves adjacent to the wall where the corpse is entombed

**Effect** The spirit gasps and wails for aid while the wall takes on the shape of its face and roils, growing tendrils. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) for as long as the haunt remains active. The haunt then rolls initiative

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(3 actions) The spirit attempts to [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md) up to two creatures within 10 feet with a +14 [Athletics](../../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) modifier, then squeezes each creature it has [grabbed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), dealing `1d10+4` damage. The haunt doesn't apply a multiple attack penalty to the second attempt to [Grapple](../../../rules/actions/grapple.md).
```

**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all creatures leave the area and resets immediately thereafter. If disabled, the haunt resets after 1 day. The haunt is permanently destroyed if the remains of the deceased are removed from the wall.
