title: Earth Vulnerability

The Elemental Plane of Air is opposed by the Plane of Earth. Any spell or [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md) effect with the [earth](../../../rules/traits/earth.md) trait that targets a creature or area within 50 feet of the rift deals 10 damage to the rift per spell levels (or per 2 levels for magic items, feats, and so forth). For example, a 3rd-level [earthbind](../../../compendium/spells/earthbind.md) spell cast on a creature near the air rift deals 30 points of damage to the rift.
```

title: Weightlessness [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature comes within 50 feet of the rift

**Effect** The air rift creates a shroud of subjective gravity around the creature for 1 minute. The creature can use a free action, which has the [concentrate](../../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, to choose any direction they wish for gravity to pull them. This allows a creature to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) along any surface or [Fly](../../../rules/actions/fly.md) in a straight line by choosing a direction into midair. For unattended objects and mindless creatures, this is microgravity: they float in place unless pushed off a surface.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) Winds blow through the area in a random direction, causing creatures and objects within 50 feet of the air rift to float up, down, north, south, east, or west (roll a d6 to determine which direction). Creatures and objects in the area must attempt a DC 37 Fortitude save. If a creature is pushed into a solid object or another creature by this effect, both take `3d8+15` bludgeoning damage on impact.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is pushed 10 feet, but takes only half damage from impact.
> - **Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet, falls [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and takes full damage from impact.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 40 feet, falls [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone), and takes double damage from impact.
