- **Disable** DC 18 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) to harmlessly trigger the trap by nudging the gate or the dangling winch, or DC 24 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) to stabilize the grate so it doesn't collapse.  

- **AC** 21 , **Fort** +17, **Ref** +11
- **Hardness** 14, **HP** 56 (BT 28)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses**

title: Pitfall [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature walks onto the grate

**Effect** The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage (20 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the [Grab an Edge](../../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) reaction to avoid falling. Whether or not the creature Grabs an Edge, the rusty winch above crashes down atop the triggering creature, dealing `3d10` bludgeoning damage and dislodging its grip (DC 24 basic Reflex save). The creature can still try to [Grab an Edge](../../../rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) again.
