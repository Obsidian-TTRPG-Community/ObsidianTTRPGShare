(3 actions) For each of its actions, the trap attempts a ghostly hand [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against a different creature within 50 feet of the ruins of the house (if there are fewer than 3 creatures, the haunt doesn't use its remaining actions).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Ghostly Grip

A creature outside the house that takes damage from the host of spirits' ghostly hand [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save or be pulled directly into the house. If there is a wall in the creature's path, that section of wall is destroyed, and the creature takes an additional `3d12` bludgeoning damage. The haunt's ghostly hand [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) also deals an additional `6d6` bludgeoning damage to a target already inside the house (DC 42 basic Fortitude save).

**Reset** The haunt ends 1 round after no creatures are within 50 feet of the house. The haunt resets after 1 day.
