[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [divine](../../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [environmental](../../../rules/traits/environmental.md)  [kaiju](../../../rules/traits/kaiju-frp2.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 10  

Ebeshra fires a crystal at a creature to pin them onto the Material Plane.

- **Disable** DC 48 [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (legendary) or [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (legendary) to earn Ebeshra's favor and allow safe travel or DC 51 [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) (master) to momentarily divert Ebeshra's attention

title: Fire Pin [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature Ebeshra can see begins to use a [teleportation](../../../rules/traits/teleportation.md) effect or an effect that would move any number of targets to a different plane;

**Effect** Ebeshra hurls a crystal at the triggering creature. The triggering creature and all creatures within 50 feet of the creature take `16d8` piercing damage (DC 45 basic Reflex save) and additional effects based on the result of their save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The effect is counteracted, and the creature can't use [teleportation](../../../rules/traits/teleportation.md) effects or planar travel effects for 1 minute.
> - **Failure** As success, but for 1 day instead of 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** As success, but for 1 week instead of 1 minute. Additionally, the creature becomes pinned under the crystal and must succeed at 3 total DC 45 checks to [Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) from under the crystal.
```

**Reset** Ebeshra waits `1d4` rounds to break off another crystal.
