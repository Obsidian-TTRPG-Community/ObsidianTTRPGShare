# Disorienting Illusions *Hazard 1*  
[illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 20  

Illusions cloaking this chamber cause it to appear distorted and constantly shifting, with the room and all its contents appearing tilted, irregular, and in motion.

- **Disable** DC 17 [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting) (trained) to calculate the room's dimensions despite the illusions, or dispel magic (1st level; counteract DC 17) to counteract the illusions

title: Disorient [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature enters the room

**Effect** Illusions cause the appearance of the room and the objects inside it to constantly warp, shift, bend, and distort for 1 minute. Each creature in the room while it's distorting must attempt a DC 17 [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature disbelieves the illusions and is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature disbelieves the illusions but still sees them. It treats the room as difficult terrain.
> - **Failure** The creature is fooled by the illusions. It treats the room as difficult terrain and becomes [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened). As long as it remains in the room, it can't reduce its [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) value below 1.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but each time the creature attempts a move action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or they lose the action, and on a critical failure, it also falls [prone](../../../rules/conditions.md#Prone).
