[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +17  

Hell hounds [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible) to all but their lone target burn their chosen victim.

- **Disable** [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) DC 24 (expert) to perform an exorcism (with 2 actions)

[conjuration](../../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature that doesn't openly wear the symbol of [Asmodeus](../../../compendium/setting/deities/asmodeus.md) comes within 60 feet of the haunt's initial location.

**Effect** The hounds appear before the chosen target and begin to chase that creature, howling wildly. The haunt rolls initiative. Others cannot see or hear this baying and must [Seek](../../../rules/actions/seek.md) to determine the hounds' location.  
%% #trait/conjuration #trait/occult %%
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(2 actions) The haunt uses its first action to [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md), then its second action for a jaws [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against its designated target if it is in reach. If the target is not in reach, the haunt resets.

Speed 60 feet.
```
^routine

**Reset** If their designated target dies or the hounds can't reach it in a turn, the hounds vanish into noxious smoke, but they manifest again elsewhere in the city after the next sunset.
