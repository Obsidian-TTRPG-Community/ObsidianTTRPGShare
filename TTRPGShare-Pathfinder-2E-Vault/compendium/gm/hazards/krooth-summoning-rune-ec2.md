# Krooth Summoning Rune *Hazard 8*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  [uncommon](../../../rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +14 expert  

The haze conceals a rune that summons a krooth in front of the door to area B10.

- **Disable** DC 24 [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) to approach without triggering the trap followed by DC 26 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to erase the rune, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 24) to counteract the rune.

title: Summon Monster [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [conjuration](../../../rules/traits/conjuration.md)  summon  

- **Trigger**: A non-xulgath, non-demon creature that isn't carrying a religious symbol of Zevgavizeb crosses from the north part of the hall to the south part of the hall

**Effect** The trap summons a krooth (Bestiary 215). The krooth rolls initiative and remains for `2d6` rounds, after which the spell ends and the krooth disappears. The krooth also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. Unlike most summoned creatures, the krooth can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions.

**Reset** The trap resets after 24 hours.
