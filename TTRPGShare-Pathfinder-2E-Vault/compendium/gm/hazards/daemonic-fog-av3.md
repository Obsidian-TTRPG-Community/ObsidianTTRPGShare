# Daemonic Fog *Hazard 10*  
[environmental](../../../rules/traits/environmental.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 30 expert  

The fog solidifies into tiny, gnawing creatures that devour everyone within before fading back into mist.

- **Disable** DC 28 [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) (expert) to disrupt the fog before the hazard triggers or dispel magic (5th level; counteract DC 26) to counteract the magic.

[divine](../../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature crosses the cavern's midpoint (the dotted line on the map)

**Effect** The hazard deals `9d6` piercing damage (DC 32 basic Reflex save) to the triggering creature and all other non-fiend creatures within 20 feet. A creature that critically fails the saving throw is [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for `1d4` rounds.

```

**Reset** The hazard resets over the course of an hour as the daemonic stain reenergizes the fog.
