- **Disable** DC 38 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (master) to deface the mirror's pane, or dispel magic (7th level; counteract DC 36) to dispel the mirror or counteract the transformation

title: Painful Transformation [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[attack](../../../rules/traits/attack.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature is reflected in the mirror

**Effect** The triggering creature's body is painfully squished, stretched, and distorted to match their reflection. The creature takes `6d10+30` force damage and must attempt a DC 39 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and is [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage and is [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 4 rounds.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute. As long as the creature is [clumsy](../../../rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) or [enfeebled](../../../rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), it additionally takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.
>
>    When the effects of this trap end, the triggering creature's transformation ends, and its body reverts to its natural form.
