Four huge tubs containing congealed wax, enchanted to melt and envelop unwary intruders, each sit atop a cold fire.

- **Disable** [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC 43 (master) to drain the wax from a tub or [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) DC 45 (master) to push through the wax blocking a sealed door and escape (other creatures must push their own way through, as the wax reseals)  

- **AC** 39 , **Fort** +30, **Ref** +25
- **HP** 72 (BT 36) to destroy the wax on a sealed door and allow anyone to escape through the door; **Tub Hardness** 25, **Tub HP** 104 (BT 52) to destroy a tub and prevent it from making any further attacks
- **Immunities** critical hits; fire (tubs only); object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses**

title: Seal Room [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature comes within 5 feet of a tub

**Effect** The fires beneath the vats blaze to life, magically melting the wax in the tubs. The tubs emit gouts of wax over the room's exits, sealing them shut. The trap then rolls initiative.

````ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn per [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) or destroyed tub. On each action, a different tub spews hot wax at a random creature in the room, dealing `3d12` fire damage to the target and all adjacent creatures (DC 35 basic Reflex save). On a failure or critical failure, the creature is also encased in hot wax.

A creature that starts its turn encased in wax takes `8d12` fire damage and is [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it Escapes the hardening wax (DC 35). Each turn it remains encased, the damage dealt by the hot wax decreases by `2d12` but.

[Escape](../../../rules/actions/escape.md) increases by 2 (minimum 0 damage, maximum DC 43). A creature that can't get free from the wax might suffocate (Core Rulebook 478).

**Reset** The trap deactivates and resets after 1 hour. At that time, the wax in the tubs cools and congeals, and any wax elsewhere in the room magically goes back into the tubs.
