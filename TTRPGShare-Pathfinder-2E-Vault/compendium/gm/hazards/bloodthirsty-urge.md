# Bloodthirsty Urge *Hazard 10*  
[haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 31 trained  

An object haunted by the echoes of a vicious mind attempts to kill someone who comes near.

- **Trigger**: A creature moves within 10 feet of the haunted object.

**Effect** The haunt takes control of the triggering creature, forcing it to attack itself. The creature must attempt a DC 29 Will save.

> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target makes a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against itself and automatically hits; the target also becomes [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The target makes a [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) against itself and automatically scores a critical hit; the target also becomes [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target attempts a Fortitude save. If the target succeeds, it is subject to the effects of a failure instead. If the target fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and dies.
