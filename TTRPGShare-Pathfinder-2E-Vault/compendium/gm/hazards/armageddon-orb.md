# Armageddon Orb *Hazard 23*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 10 or detect magic.  

A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of the god Rovagug's blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.

- **Disable** [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC 48 (legendary) to imbue thieves' tools with aspects representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use them to drain away the orb's power over 10 minutes; the character attempting this check takes 5 fire damage each round until the orb is depleted.

- **Trigger**: A special condition set by the trap's creator occurs; this is typically the event of their death.

**Effect** Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing `10d6` fire damage to creatures and objects in the area. Each creature or object can attempt a DC 46 basic Reflex save. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level an entire mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.
