- **Trigger**: A non-Arodenite creature approaches within 5 feet of the lectern

**Effect** A spectral minister appears before the pulpit, resembling an ever-shifting amalgamation of several past priests. The spectral minister delivers fervent exhortations about faithlessness. Each creature on the dais must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or become [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained). On a critical failure, the creature is [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained).

**Reset** The spirits return in `1d8` hours as long as any xulgaths remain in Moonstone Hall.
