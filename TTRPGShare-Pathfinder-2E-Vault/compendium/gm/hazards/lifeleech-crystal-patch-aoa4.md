- **Trigger**: A creature with blood moves through a patch of lifeleech crystals.

**Effect** The crystals twist and slash, animating and cutting into the creature as it walks, dealing `5d8` slashing damage. The creature must attempt a DC 28 Reflex saving throw. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature takes full damage and is [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained). Failure The creature takes double damage and is [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained). Critical Failure As failure, plus the creature's blood causes fresh growth. A new 10-foot-square patch of lifeleech crystals grows in an adjacent space to the current patch of crystals.
