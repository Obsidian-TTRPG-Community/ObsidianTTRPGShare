# Wronged Monk's Wrath *Hazard 13*  
[haunt](../../../rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 32 trained  

A monk's tormented spirit attacks intruders.

- **Disable** DC 32 [Irori Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) (trained) to clean the room and return the prayer items to their proper arrangement, DC 37 [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (expert) to state an Iroran prayer of peace and put the haunt to rest, or DC 40 [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism) (master) to create a ward against future hauntings.

- **Trigger**: A creature enters the prayer room

**Effect** The abbot's spirit appears and begins to channel powerful ki energy. One round later, the room fills with a powerful kinetic storm, dealing `3d10+15` electricity damage and `3d10+15` force damage to all creatures in the room. Creatures in the room must attempt a DC 37 Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes [deafened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes full damage, `2d8` [persistent electricity damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and becomes [deafened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute.
```

**Reset** The haunt re-forms after 1 hour. The haunt becomes disabled and doesn't re-form if a creature lights all of the candles in the room and offers a prayer to [Irori](../../setting/deities/irori.md).
