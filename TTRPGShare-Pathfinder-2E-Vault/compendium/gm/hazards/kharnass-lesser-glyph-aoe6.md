# Kharnas's Lesser Glyph *Hazard 17*  
[magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](../../../rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 43  

A [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) glyph suddenly lights up and dominates the mind of any creature not bearing the sigil of Kharnas the Angel-Binder.

- **Disable** DC 46 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (legendary) to destroy the glyph, DC 42 [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana) (master) to harmlessly divert the glyph's power, or dispel magic (7th level; counteract DC 38) to counteract the glyph.  
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Dominate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[arcane](../../../rules/traits/arcane.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature who doesn't bear the sigil of Kharnas attempts to open the door

**Effect** A surge of the Radiant Spark's latent power courses through the glyph and washes over the triggering creature. If the creature is undead, it takes `10d10` positive damage. If it's living, it instead regains `10d10` Hit Points. It then must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be affected by a 6th-level [dominate](../../../compendium/spells/dominate.md) spell. The spell commands the affected creature to attack the nearest creature who doesn't bear the sigil of Kharnas.

**Reset** The glyph can affect two creatures before it deactivates for 5 minutes and automatically resets.
