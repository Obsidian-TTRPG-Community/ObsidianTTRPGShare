- **Trigger**: The trip wire is pulled or severed, typically because a creature walked through the square with the trip wire

**Effect** Steam erupts from the pipes, dealing `3d6` bludgeoning damage and `3d6` fire damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save) to all creatures within 15 feet. Creatures that critically fail their save are knocked prone.
