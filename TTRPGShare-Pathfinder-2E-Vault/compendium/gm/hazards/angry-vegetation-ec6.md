# Angry Vegetation *Hazard 20*  
[complex](../../../rules/traits/complex.md)  [environmental](../../../rules/traits/environmental.md)  [unique](../../../rules/traits/unique.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 42 master to notice massive buds beneath the other foliage before they open.  

Five large flowers in the weed-choked field unfurl, each dusting pollen onto vines that animate into wemmuths.

- **Disable** DC 48 [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) (master) or DC 48 [Performance](../../skills.md#Performance) (legendary) to calm a flower, closing it.  

- **AC** 37 , **Fort** +33, **Ref** +30
- **HP** 120 per flower
- **Immunities** [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses** nullfire 20
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Bloom [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A non-plant creature enters the garden

**Effect** The blooms open, spawning a single wemmuth that acts on the hazard's initiative, and the hazard rolls for initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
[>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") If there are fewer wemmuths than open flowers, the flowers create more wemmuths (so there as many wemmuths as open flowers) as their first action.

For their second action, the flowers produce a mindaddling pollen. Each non-plant creature within 30 feet of a flower must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or become [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round (or [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 round, on a critical failure). The pollen is an emotion, mental, and olfactory effect.
```
^routine

**Reset** Wemmuths collapse into ordinary vines and the trap resets if the area is left alone for 1 minute.
