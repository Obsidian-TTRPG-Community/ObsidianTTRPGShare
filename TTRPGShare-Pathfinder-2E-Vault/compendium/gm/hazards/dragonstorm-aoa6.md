# Dragonstorm *Hazard 18*  
[environmental](../../../rules/traits/environmental.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** +40 legendary  

A massive storm stirs in the skies above Breachill and Citadel Altaerein. As specific events begin during the three waves of the manifestation's retribution, the dragonstorm wreaks localized havoc.

- **Disable** The dragonstorm can't be disabled—only endured.

It ends only once the attack on Breachill and Citadel Altaerein is over.
