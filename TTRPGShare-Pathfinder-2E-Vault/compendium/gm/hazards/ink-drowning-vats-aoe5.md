(4 actions) The trap loses 1 action for each disabled ink spout. On each of the trap's actions, a spout pours ink, increasing the depth of the ink in that vat by 2 feet. Creatures standing in the ink are exposed to a dose of poison ink. Once the vat is full of ink, the trap stops using actions, but creatures in the vat might start drowning.
