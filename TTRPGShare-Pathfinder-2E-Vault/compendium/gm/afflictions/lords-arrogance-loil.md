# Lord's Arrogance
*Curse 7*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

You're filled with the unearned confidence of a young noble and carry yourself as if you can do no wrong.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 23 Will

**Effect** Whenever you make a [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check or a [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) check that would give you information (such as to [Sense Motive](../../../rules/actions/sense-motive.md)), you always receive at least one piece of false information that you believe with absolute confidence, even on a success or better. If you attempt to act on this false information, you receive a –1 circumstance penalty on any skill checks you attempt.
