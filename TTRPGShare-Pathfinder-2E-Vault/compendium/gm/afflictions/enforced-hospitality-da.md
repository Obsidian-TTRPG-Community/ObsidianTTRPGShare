# Enforced Hospitality
*Curse 13*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

Cast upon the rude or inconsiderate, this curse compels you to offer a genuine and warm greeting to each new creature you meet.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 31 Will

**Effect** This curse compels you to great those you meet as though they were old friends. Whenever you come across a creature (or group of creatures) for the first time, you must spend 1 action greeting them or become [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute, even if the creature is obviously [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile). No matter your intention, your greeting comes across as warm and genuine, and it grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Make an Impression](../../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md).
```

## Tempting Curse

Your compulsion to greet newcomers intensifies. You must greet every individual creature you meet for the first time by spending 1 action greeting them or become [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute. If you meet more creatures than you have actions, you can continue spending actions greeting creatures across multiple turns. For example, if you encountered six bandits, you could greet three bandits on the first round and three bandits on the second round, and you wouldn't become [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed) unless you took another action before you finished greeting them. For 1 minute or until you take a hostile action, you gain the effects of a 7th-level [sanctuary](../../spells/sanctuary.md) against creatures you've greeted in this way (DC 31).
