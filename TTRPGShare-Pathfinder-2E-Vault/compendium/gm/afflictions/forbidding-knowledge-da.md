Information you never should have known lingers everpresent in your mind.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 28 Will

**Effect** This curse is acquired when encountering forbidden knowledge. This curse is always associated with a specific piece or topic of knowledge, such as a demon lord's plan to overtake a government or the true name of a powerful wizard. Your tongue trips when you try to tell another this knowledge, and your hand stalls when you attempt to write it. Any attempt at communicating it fails, even as you can't stop thinking about it.
```

## Tempting Curse

When you activate the tempted curse, you must spend 2 actions to attempt to speak the triggering knowledge. This allows you to redirect the curse's energy and cast [silence](../../spells/silence.md) heightened to 4th level, centered on yourself. You are still unable to speak the knowledge clearly, but you can convey a single word to an adjacent creature. You gain the [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition for the remainder of the day. This condition can't be reduced until the next time you perform your daily preparations, at which point it ends.
