# Sellsword's Folly
*Curse 9*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [emotion](../../../rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

Even the most experienced combat veteran becomes as reckless as a rookie when suffering from sellsword's folly.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 26 Will

**Effect** The chaos of combat overwhelms you. Each time you roll initiative for a combat encounter, you must attempt a new saving throw against the curse; on a failure, you become [confused](../../../rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 round. This is an [incapacitation](../../../rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect.
```
