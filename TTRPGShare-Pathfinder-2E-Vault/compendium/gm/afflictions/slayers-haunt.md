# Slayer's Haunt
*Curse 4*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [visual](../../../rules/traits/visual.md)  

You are haunted by all those you have killed.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 19 Will

**Effect** You see all creatures around you as those you have slain, still bearing their wounds. You can't identify, [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about, or otherwise interact with these creatures in any way that involves seeing their true form without first succeeding at a Will save against the curse's DC to see through the illusion. On a critical failure for such a Will save, you become [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
```
