# Exhaustive Addiction
*Disease 15*  
[disease](../../../rules/traits/disease.md)  [unique](../../../rules/traits/unique.md)  

Addictive exhaustion results from exposure to Kuworsys's spores, through close proximity with the monster or in fungus-filled pits throughout Kuworsys's lair. At the onset, afflicted creatures find themselves gradually becoming disinterested in life. As the disease worsens, they become hyper-focused on a single activity. As the disease reaches its final stages, sustenance and rest provide no relief for them.
