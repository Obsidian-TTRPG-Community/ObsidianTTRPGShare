# Rage of The Excommunicant
*Curse 10*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  

Placed upon heretics or those who broke faith, this curse causes symbols of your former faith to burn you upon sight.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 27 Will

**Effect** This curse is always associated with a specific deity, and is typically experienced only by one of their former clerics or champions. The sight of that deity's religious symbol burns you, dealing `1d6` damage every round you look upon it. You can avert your eyes to avoid losing Hit Points once you know where the symbol is located. In addition, the curse hardens you against that god. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws and AC versus divine spells cast by that deity's clergy.
```

## Tempting Curse

The sight of the deity's religious symbol burns you with the god's rage. You can activate the tempted curse upon viewing the deity's symbol. You are [quickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 minute and can use the extra action each round only to [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) and [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md). For the rest of the day, whenever you see the deity's religious symbol, you lose `2d6` Hit Points.
