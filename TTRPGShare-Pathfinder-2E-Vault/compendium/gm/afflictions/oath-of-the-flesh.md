# Oath of the Flesh
*Curse 7*  
[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

When you swear an oath, you must obey that oath or suffer terrible consequences.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 23 Fortitude

**Effect** Each time you make a promise to someone, an ornate symbol representing that promise is magically carved into your flesh. Breaking any of these promises causes the symbol tattoo to grow into a gaping wound, dealing `3d6` slashing damage to you; damage from the curse can't be healed as long as the curse is still in effect.
