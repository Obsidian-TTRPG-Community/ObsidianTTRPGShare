# Curse of Biting Swarms
*Curse 5*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

You emit a deathlike stench that attracts swarms of carrion-eating insects.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 20 Fortitude

**Effect** You smell like a charnel house, making it easy for creatures with scent to notice you; they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their [Perception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) against you. Additionally, the first time you're exposed to sunlight each day, biting insects attack you, scattering once they've taken damage. You then become [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained) until the next time you take a full night's rest. These conditions can't be reduced below 1 by other means.
