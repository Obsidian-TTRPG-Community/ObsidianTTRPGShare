This ward placed on valuables aims to bog down thieves and prevent them from fleeing.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 15 Fortitude

**Effect** This curse causes stolen items to weigh you down. While the curse is in effect, you treat any stolen items you carry as 1 Bulk heavier. This increase in Bulk remains in effect until the curse is lifted or the item is returned to its owner.
```

## Tempting Curse

Your pockets weigh you down as you dream of filling them with riches. You are encumbered, but you double your total maximum carrying capacity.
