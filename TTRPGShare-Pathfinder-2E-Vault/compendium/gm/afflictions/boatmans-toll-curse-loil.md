# Boatman's Toll Curse
*Curse 20*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [death](../../../rules/traits/death.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](../../../rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

Your soul is treated as collateral for the crimes you've committed. This punishment is reserved for those who have committed truly heinous acts, such as using holy magic against an important undead citizen or conspiring with enemies of the state.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 43 Will

**Effect** A tattoo of a skull with coins on its eyes etches itself into your skin, dealing `6d10` cold damage and `6d10` negative damage and causing you to become [drained](../../../rules/conditions.md#Drained). If the tattoo is ever removed or destroyed by any means, it reappears after 24 hours and deals its damage again unless this curse is removed first. If you're reduced to 0 Hit Points while the tattoo is on your body, you die immediately, and your soul is banished to Abaddon. You can't be revived, reincarnated, raised as an undead, or otherwise come back to life unless the boatman Charon relinquishes your soul.
