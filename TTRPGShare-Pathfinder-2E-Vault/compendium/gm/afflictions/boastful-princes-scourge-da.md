# Boastful Prince's Scourge
*Curse 7*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [polymorph](../../../rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [rare](../../../rules/traits/rare.md)  [transmutation](../../../rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

Used as a punishment against the vain or the arrogant, this curse slowly transforms you into a frog in note just body, but mind as well.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 23 Will

**Effect** Your features slowly morph into that of a frog's as you grow a prominent vocal sac. You gain the [amphibious](../../../rules/traits/amphibious-b1.md) trait and can breathe both air and water. You are [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) as long as you are under the effect of this curse, and you can't reduce your [stupefied](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) value below 1.
```

## Tempting Curse

You transform fully, as [animal form](../../spells/animal-form.md), giving you the specific abilities of a frog. The duration of this casting is until you make your daily preparations, and you can't [Dismiss](../../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell. While you are under the effect of [animal form](../../spells/animal-form.md) due to this curse, you have all the usual limitations of [animal form](../../spells/animal-form.md), including the fact that you can't speak (though you can still understand any languages you know).
