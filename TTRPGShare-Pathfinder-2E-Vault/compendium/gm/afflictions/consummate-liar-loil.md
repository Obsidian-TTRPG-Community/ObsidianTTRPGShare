# Consummate Liar
*Curse 14*  
[curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [enchantment](../../../rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  [mental](../../../rules/traits/mental.md)  

It becomes your first instinct to answer every question with an obvious and blatant lie, no matter how trivial.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 31 Will

**Effect** Whenever you're asked a question directly, you must attempt a DC 32 Will save. On a failure, you spout an obvious lie with an automatic failure at your [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) check. If you succeed, you can choose your words carefully and answer however you wish, but if you choose to answer truthfully, the agony of telling the truth causes you to take `3d8` mental damage.
