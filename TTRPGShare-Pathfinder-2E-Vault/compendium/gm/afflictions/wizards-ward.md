# Wizard's Ward
*Curse 6*  
[abjuration](../../../rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

A wizard's ward is placed upon a single book, usually a spellbook. If you damage the book, you must attempt a save against the curse's effect.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 22 Will

**Effect** You take `5d6` damage of the same damage type as the damage you dealt to the book, and the damage can't be healed as long as the curse lasts. Repairing the book, including replacing any missing text, ends this curse.
```
