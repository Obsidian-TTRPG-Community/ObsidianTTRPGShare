# Curse of Petulant Whispers
*Curse 2*  
[auditory](../../../rules/traits/auditory.md)  [curse](../../../rules/traits/curse.md)  [illusion](../../../rules/traits/illusion.md)  [magical](../../../rules/traits/magical.md)  

A cruel, ghostly voice follows you, whispering your transgressions to anyone you encounter.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 16 Will

**Effect** Whenever you try to speak to another creature who doesn't know you well, they hear whispers in a language they understand that reveal hints and phrases related to the things about which you feel most guilty. You have a –2 circumstance bonus to [Diplomacy](../../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Make an Impression](../../../rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) against those creatures, and if you roll a failure on your check, you get a critical failure instead.
