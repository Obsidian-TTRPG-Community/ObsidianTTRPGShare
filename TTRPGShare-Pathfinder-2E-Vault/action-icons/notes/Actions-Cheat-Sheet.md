| [Aid](../../rules/actions/aid.md) *⬲{ .Pathfinder }*                       | Must have used an action previously to help your ally. When an ally makes a skill check, you assist them, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to their check. If you’re a master with the check you attempted, the bonus is +3, and if you’re legendary, it’s +4 Crit. Fail: -1 circumstance penalty to their check. Must pass a check set by the GM, Base DC 20.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You are [flat-footed](TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) (-2 circumstance penalty to AC) and take a –2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls. The only move actions you can take while prone are [Crawl](../../rules/actions/crawl.md) and [Stand](../../rules/actions/stand.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*                 | **[Attack](../../rules/traits/attack.md)** You attempt to escape from being [Grabbed](../../rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [Immobilized](../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), or [Restrained](../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained) against one impediment. Attempt a acrobatics, athletics or unarmed attack check vs. DC of the effect (Athletics of creature grabbing, Thievery of creature that tied you up, Spell effect or [Escape](../../rules/actions/escape.md) DC). Crit: You are free and can stride 5ft. Crit. Fail: You don’t get free, and you can’t attempt again until next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [Interact](../../rules/actions/interact.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*             | **[Manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)** You can [Grab](../../rules/abilities/grab.md) an unattended or stored object, open a door, etc.. You might have to attempt a skill check to determine if successful. This action generally provokes reactions such as [Attack of Opportunity](../../rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

You land in the space where [Leap](../../rules/actions/leap.md) ends. Leap Vertically moves 3ft. Vertically and 5ft. Horizontally. The Athletics skill offers [Long Jump](../../rules/actions/long-jump.md) and [High Jump](../../rules/actions/high-jump.md) activities, which each cost 2 actions and can be taken by any creature, and allow you to move a greater distance based on how high your check result is. (p. 241)                                                                           |

If the trigger occurs before the start of your next turn, you can use the chosen action as a reaction (provided you still meet the requirements to use it). If you [Ready](../../rules/actions/ready.md) an attack, and that attack would have a multiple attack penalty if it were made on your turn, the penalty still applies during your reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Release](../../rules/actions/release.md) *⭓{ .Pathfinder }*               | **[Manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md)** You release something you’re holding in your hand(s). Does not trigger reactions that can be triggered by actions with the [Manipulate](../../rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait. If you want to Release something outside of turn, use [Ready](../../rules/actions/ready.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Seek](../../rules/actions/seek.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*                     | **[Concentrate](../../rules/traits/concentrate.md) [Secret](../../rules/traits/secret.md)** You look for unseen creatures or objects in a 30ft cone or 15ft burst within line of sight. If searching for objects (secret doors, hazards), you [Search](../../rules/actions/search.md) a 10-foot square adjacent to you. The GM makes a secret [Perception](TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Perception) check vs. Stealth DCs of hidden creatures or objects in that area. Success: One or more hidden creatures’ or objects’ position is revealed. Otherwise, the GM will not specify.                                                                             |

Crit: You determine creature’s true intentions and any [Mental](../../rules/traits/mental.md) magic affecting it. Success: You determine whether it is behaving normally, but not its exact intentions or magic affecting it. Fail: You detect what it wants you to believe or think they’re behaving normally. Crit. Fail. You get a false sense of its intentions. You typically can’t try again until the situation changes significantly. |

| [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*                     | **[Move](../../rules/traits/move.md)** Your speed is at least 10ft. Move 5ft without provoking reactions that trigger as a result of your moving or leaving or entering a square. You can’t [Step](../../rules/actions/step.md) into [Difficult Terrain](../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Difficult%20Terrain) without Feather Step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
