  You heat a foe's blood and boil it within its veins. The target takes 10d10 fire damage, with a Fortitude save. A nonliving creature with blood in its body (such as a vampire) can be affected, but a creature with no blood is immune.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target takes half damage.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[Drained]] 2.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [[Drained]] 3.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.
