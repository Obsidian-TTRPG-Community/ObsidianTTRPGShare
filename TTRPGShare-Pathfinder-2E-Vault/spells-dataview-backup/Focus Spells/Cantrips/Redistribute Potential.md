**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Range** 60 feet; **Area** 2 adjacent 5-foot squares
**Saving Throw** basic Fortitude

---
Energy attempts to balance out, but with your magic, you can shunt all the energy in one area to another. Creatures in either area take `dice: 4d4|avg` damage with a basic Fortitude save. Choose one of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature that fails its save also becomes [Clumsy](../../../Conditions/Clumsy.md) 1 from numbness if it's in the area of stolen heat or [Enfeebled](../../../Conditions/Enfeebled.md) 1 from heat stroke if it's in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its save against; it's unaffected by the other area.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`.

**Amp** You can affect the flow of energy on a much grander scale. Instead of two 5-foot squares, you create two 10-foot bursts. They still must be adjacent to one another and can overlap. A creature in both areas can still be affected by only one of your choice. The spell's damage increases to `dice: 6d6|avg`. The conditions last for 1 minute.
**Amp** **Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by `dice: 2d6|avg` instead of 1d4.
