**Cast** ►►► material, somatic, verbal
**Range** 60 feet; **Area** 1 cube 20 feet on each side
**Duration** 1 minute

You weave light into a cube of vivid and fantastic patterns. The walls shed bright light for 10 feet (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and completely block line of sight; creatures within the cage can't be seen by creatures outside of it, though they can see each other, and creatures outside of it can't see into it. You can Dismiss the spell, and if you Cast the Spell again, your previous hologram cage ends.

**Heightened (7th)** The range of the spell increases to 80 feet, and you can expand the cube to be 25 feet on each side.

---
**Amp** Force walls make the cage's barrier physical as well as visual. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the cage's wall has AC 10, Hardness equal to double the spell's level, and HP equal to quadruple the spell's level. The spell is disrupted if any of its walls would pass through a creature when you cast it.
