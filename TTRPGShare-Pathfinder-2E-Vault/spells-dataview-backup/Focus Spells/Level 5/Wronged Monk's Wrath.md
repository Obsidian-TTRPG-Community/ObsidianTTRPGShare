---
You unleash your ki as a powerful storm of force and lightning, dealing `dice: 2d6|avg` force damage and `dice: 2d12|avg` electricity damage to creatures in the area.

If you use 2 actions to cast the spell, increase the size of the emanation to 10 feet and the damage to `dice: 3d6|avg` force damage and `dice: 3d12|avg` electricity damage.

If you use 3 actions to cast the spell, increase the size of the emanation to 20 feet and the damage to `dice: 4d6|avg` force and `dice: 4d12|avg` electricity damage.

Each creature attempts one basic Reflex save that applies to both types of damage. On a failed save, the creature is [Deafened](../../../Conditions/Deafened.md) for 1 round; on a critical failure, the creature also takes `dice: 2d12|avg` persistent electricity damage and is deafened for 1 minute.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The force damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg` and the electricity damage by `dice: 1d12|avg`, or `dice: 2d6|avg` and `dice: 2d12|avg` if you use 2 or 3 actions.
