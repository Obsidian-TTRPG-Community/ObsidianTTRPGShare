**Bloodline** shadow
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Area** 10-foot emanation; **Targets** enemies in the area
**Saving Throw** Reflex; **Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

---
Your shadow wriggles before spreading out from you, forming a gateway of clinging, consuming shadow through which the horrors of another plane can barely be seen. The first time each turn you Sustain the Spell, the radius increases by 5 feet. Each enemy that enters the area or begins its turn in the area takes `dice: 2d6|avg` negative damage and must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature sinks partially into the shadow, taking half damage and a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for as long it remains in the area.
**Failure** As success, but the creature takes full damage and a –10-foot circumstance penalty.
**Critical Failure** The creature is absorbed into the shadows, where it can be seen below the surface; it takes double damage and is [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md) for 1 round or until it Escapes.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
