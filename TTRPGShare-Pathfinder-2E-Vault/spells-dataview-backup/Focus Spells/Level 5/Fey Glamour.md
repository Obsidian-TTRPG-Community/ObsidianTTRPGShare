You call upon fey glamours to cloak an area or the targets in illusion. This has the effect of either [Illusory Scene](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%205/Illusory%20Scene.md) on the area or [Veil](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%204/Veil.md) on the creatures, as if heightened to a level 1 level lower than fey glamour, using fey glamour's range and duration.
