**Mystery** life
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Duration** 1 minute

You transcend your physical form, becoming a beacon of healing energy. Your body exudes bright light like a torch. You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5 to negative damage, and your unarmed Strikes deal an extra `dice: 1d4|avg` positive damage.

You can touch a living creature with an Interact action to restore `dice: 6d8|avg` Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to life-giving form's healing for 1 minute. This is a positive healing effect. You can't heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by positive damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes `dice: 3d4|avg` positive damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune.

You can Dismiss this spell.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the Hit Points restored with an Interact action by `dice: 1d8|avg`, the positive damage by 1, and the resistance and weakness by 1.
