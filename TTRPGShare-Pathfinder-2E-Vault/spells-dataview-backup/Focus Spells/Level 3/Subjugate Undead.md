**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** varies

---
You attempt to seize control of the target. It can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If the target is already being [Controlled](../../../Conditions/Controlled.md) by another creature, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw and the undead uses the better result. Casting subjugate undead again ends any previous subjugate undead you cast.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The undead creature becomes a [Minion](../../../rules/traits/minion.md) under your control for 1 minute. The spell is dismissed if you or an ally takes a [hostile action](../../../Rules/Hostile%20Actions.md) against the minion undead.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 10 minutes.
