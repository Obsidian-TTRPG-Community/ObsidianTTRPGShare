You unleash your ki as a powerful blast of force that deals `dice: 2d6|avg` force damage. If you use 2 actions to cast ki blast, increase the size of the cone to 30 feet and the damage to `dice: 3d6|avg`. If you use 3 actions to cast ki blast, increase the size of the cone to 60 feet and the damage to `dice: 4d6|avg`. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [pushed](../../../Rules/Forced%20Movement.md) 5 feet.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is pushed 10 feet.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`, or by `dice: 2d6|avg` if you use 2 or 3 actions.
