You force the Material and Ethereal Planes to partially overlap, creating a zone that causes incorporeal and spiritual entities to take on many of the aspects of corporeal creatures. Within the ectoplasmic interstice, [Incorporeal](../../../Traits/Incorporeal.md) creatures cannot pass through solid objects or corporeal creatures, and they can manipulate and attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures and objects.

An incorporeal PC or other creature with a normal Strength modifier simply uses that modifier, but if the creature had a Strength modifier of –5, like most incorporeal monsters, it uses a +4 modifier instead, increasing its Athletics modifier by 9 accordingly. Attacks against creatures that are within the interstice overcome resistances as if they were by [Ghost Touch](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Ghost%20Touch.md) weapons.
