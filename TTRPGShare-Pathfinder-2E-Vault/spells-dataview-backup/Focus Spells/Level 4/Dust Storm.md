You call forth a swirling storm of dust. The dust storm obscures vision, with the effect of obscuring mist. The dust also makes the air unbreathable; creatures in the area must hold their breath, though wearing a scarf or similar clothing over the mouth increases the time the creature can hold its breath to 5 rounds. Creatures entering or starting their turn in the dust storm take `dice: 1d6|avg` slashing damage. Creatures that have the water trait or that are made primarily of liquid take double damage.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
