---
You summon a tangible manifestation of loneliness to cloak the target from view as surely as if it were wreathed in darkness. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target becomes [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md), but only to its allies. Any creature not allied with the target can see it normally. Effects such as [See Invisibility](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%202/See%20Invisibility.md) enable an ally to see the target. The target's allies still know the target is present and can still see all the effects of the target's actions.
**Failure** As success, except the target also becomes inaudible to its allies and imperceptible to them through any other senses.
