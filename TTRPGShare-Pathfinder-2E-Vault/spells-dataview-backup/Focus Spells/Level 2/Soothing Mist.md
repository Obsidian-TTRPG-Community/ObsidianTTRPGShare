You call forth a magical mist of positive energy that envelops a creature. The mist restores `dice: 2d8|avg` Hit Points to a target living creature and ends one source of persistent acid, bleed, fire, negative, or poison damage affecting it.

If the creature is taking [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md) from multiple sources, you select which one is removed. Against an undead target, you deal `dice: 2d8|avg` positive damage (basic Fortitude save); if it fails the save, it also takes 2 persistent positive damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing (or damage to an undead target) increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`, and the persistent positive damage to an undead creature increases by 1.
