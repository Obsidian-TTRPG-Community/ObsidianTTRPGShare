With soothing song or tales, you lull the target into an enchanting dream. When you cast the spell, the target falls [Unconscious](../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md) if it wasn't already.

While unconscious, it experiences a dream of your choice. If it sleeps for at least 1 minute, it gains the benefit of the dream for the remainder of the spell's duration.
