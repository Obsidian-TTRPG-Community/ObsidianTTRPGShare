---
You probe the target's mind to glean knowledge. This deals `dice: 1d8|avg` mental damage with a basic Will save. If the target fails the save, you sort through the stolen memories to attempt a single check to Recall Knowledge. Choose a skill that has the Recall Knowledge action, and use the target's skill modifier for the check.

**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
