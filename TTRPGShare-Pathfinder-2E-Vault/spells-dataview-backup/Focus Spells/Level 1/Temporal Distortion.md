You share some of your own temporal distortions with a foe, altering their mind and body unpredictably as they're thrown backward or forward in time. Roll `dice: 1d4|avg`. On a 1, the foe becomes [Clumsy](../../../Conditions/Clumsy.md); on a 2, it becomes [Enfeebled](../../../Conditions/Enfeebled.md); on a 3, it becomes [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md); and on a 4, you choose which condition applies.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature is either clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, or stupefied 1 for 4 rounds, depending on the result of the d4.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the time warp is stronger, increasing the condition's effects but making it run its course faster. The condition's value is 3, and the condition lasts for 2 rounds.
