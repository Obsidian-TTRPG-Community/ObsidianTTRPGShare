You fling a hollow icicle filled with winter’s wrath. Make a spell attack against a target within range. The bolt deals `dice: 1d8|avg` piercing damage and lodges in the target.

At the end of the target’s next turn, the bolt shatters, releasing a whirl of snow and ice that deals `dice: 1d12|avg` cold damage to the target and all adjacent creatures. The bolt can be removed with an Interact action, which causes it to melt harmlessly without detonating.

**Critical Success** The initial bolt deals full damage and is especially well anchored, taking 2 Interact actions to remove. The bolt’s explosion deals double damage.
**Success** The bolt and its explosion deal full damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg` and the secondary damage increases by `dice: 1d12|avg`.
