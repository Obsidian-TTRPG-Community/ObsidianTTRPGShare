**Lesson** lesson of calamity
**Cast** ► somatic
**Range** 60 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** Reflex; **Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

---
With a twist of a finger, you send a creature careening on a haphazard trajectory. The target must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes a –2 status penalty to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.
**Failure** As success, and each time the target Strides, it uses the first 5 feet of movement of the Stride to move 5 feet in a random direction (this is forced movement). This has no effect on a creature with only 5 feet of movement.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except you control the direction of the target's first 5 feet of movement of the Stride.
