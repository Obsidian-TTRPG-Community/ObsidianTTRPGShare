**Bloodline** hag
**Cast** ► verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** up to 1 minute

---
You draw forth a hag's innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute. The target is cursed with an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier: Strength ([Enfeebled](../../../Conditions/Enfeebled.md)); Dexterity ([Clumsy](../../../Conditions/Clumsy.md)); Constitution ([Drained](../../../Conditions/Drained.md)); or Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ([Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md)).

On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The condition's value is 1.
**Critical Failure** The condition's value is 2.

At the start of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect on a success.
