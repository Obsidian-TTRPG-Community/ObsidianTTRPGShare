By touching an object, you draw forth the experience of those who created and used it. If you touch a weapon, your proficiency rank with that weapon temporarily increases to trained (if it is not already higher).

If you touch a tool, your proficiency rank with the next skill check you attempt with that tool (such as a Crafting check with a blacksmith’s hammer) within the spell’s duration temporarily increases to trained (if it is not already higher). This spell has no benefit for activities that take longer than a minute to complete.
