Nothing can hold you in place. You immediately escape from every magical effect that has you [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md) or [Grabbed](../../../Conditions/Grabbed.md) unless the effect is of a higher level than your unimpeded stride spell. You then Stride. During this movement, you ignore difficult terrain and any circumstance or status penalties to your Speed.
