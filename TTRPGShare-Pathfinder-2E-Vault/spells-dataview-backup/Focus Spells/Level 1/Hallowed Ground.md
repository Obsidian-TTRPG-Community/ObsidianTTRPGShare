One small space becomes inhospitable to undead as you fill it with life-infused benevolent magic. Each undead creature in the area takes `dice: 1d6|avg` positive damage and `dice: 1d4|avg` good damage when you Cast the Spell, with a basic Fortitude save. After that, undead creatures have weakness 1 to [Positive](../../../rules/traits/positive.md) damage and your necromancy spells while in the area.

This spell also automatically attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) any attempt to raise undead in the area (if either the undead would appear in the area or the effect's caster or creator is in it).

If you Cast this Spell again, any previous hallowed ground you had cast ends.

**Heightened (+2)** The positive damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`, good damage increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`, and weakness increases by 1.
