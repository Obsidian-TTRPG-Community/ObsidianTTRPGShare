You create a shadowy illusion of a creature or a stationary object, but the illusion can exist only in an area of dim light or [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness). The spell ends if the illusion is ever out of an area of dim light or darkness. If the illusion is an object, it must fit within a 20-foot burst, and the creature can be of any size up to Gargantuan, filling a 20-foot-by-20-foot space.

The object or creature appears to animate naturally; it even generates the appropriate sounds and smells, and feels believable to the touch, though its coloring is always muted.

If the illusion is a creature, shadow illusion has the effects of an [Illusory Creature](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%202/Illusory%20Creature.md) spell of the same level, except it deals `dice: 2d8|avg` damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of the amount listed in illusory creature.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The area that an illusory object can fit in increases by 10 feet. The damage of the illusory creature's Strike increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
