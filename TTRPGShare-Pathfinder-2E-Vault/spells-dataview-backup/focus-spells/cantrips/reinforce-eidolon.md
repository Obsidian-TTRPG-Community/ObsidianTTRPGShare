You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and reinforce your eidolon's defenses. Your eidolon gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws, plus resistance to all damage equal to half the spell's level. 

Your eidolon can benefit from either [Boost Eidolon](Boost%20Eidolon.md) or reinforce eidolon, but not both; if you cast one of these spells during the other's duration, the newer spell replaces the older one.
