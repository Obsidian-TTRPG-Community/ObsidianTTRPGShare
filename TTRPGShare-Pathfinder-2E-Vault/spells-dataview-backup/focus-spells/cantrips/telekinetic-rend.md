**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Range** 60 feet; **Area** 2 non-overlapping 5-foot bursts
**Saving Throw** basic Fortitude

---
Your mind creates a violent axis of motion in a nearby space. You deal your choice of `dice: 1d6|avg` bludgeoning or `dice: 1d6|avg` slashing damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Fortitude save. A creature large enough to be in more than one of the bursts takes damage only once.
<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.

<hr>

**Amp** Your thoughts expand in scope and power. The bursts deal `dice: 1d6|avg` bludgeoning damage and `dice: 1d6|avg` slashing damage, instead of the usual damage. A creature that critically fails its save is also [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1.
**Amp** **Heightened (+2)** Both types of damage increase by 1d6 instead of just one. Add a third non-overlapping 5-foot burst to the area.
