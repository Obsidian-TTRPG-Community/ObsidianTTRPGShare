Drawing your hand in a sweeping gesture, you shroud the target in a veil of night. The target's eyes are blanketed in [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness). If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with [Light Blindness](../../../Bestiary/Abilities/Light%20Blindness.md)), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The target is shrouded in murky darkness. Unless the target has [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Bestiary/Abilities/Darkvision](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Bestiary/Abilities/Darkvision), other creatures are [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) to it.
