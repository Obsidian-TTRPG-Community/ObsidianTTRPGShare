**Critical Success** The target disbelieves the illusion and is unaffected.
**Success** For 1 round, the target is [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) 2 and takes a –2 status penalty to any checks it makes to determine the effects of reactions.
**Failure** For 1 minute, the target is stupefied 2 and can't use reactions.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and all spaces are difficult terrain for the target.
