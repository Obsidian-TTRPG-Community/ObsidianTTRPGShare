You draw an occluding veil of spirits around yourself, blocking yourself especially well from undead eyes. You become [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) to all creatures, and you are [Hidden](../../../Conditions/Hidden.md) from undead creatures regardless of what precise senses they have; this grants the effects of [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level 2/Invisibility](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%202/Invisibility), but against all the undead creature's precise senses. If you physically interact with an undead creature or use a [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action, the spell ends.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** You can target one additional willing creature within 30 feet. The spell ends if any target physically interacts with an undead creature or uses a hostile action
