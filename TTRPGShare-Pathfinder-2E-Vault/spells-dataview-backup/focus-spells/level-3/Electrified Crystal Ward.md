**Cast** ►► somatic
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 hinge or latch

You create an [Electric Latch Rune](../../../Hazards/Electric%20Latch%20Rune.md) hazard on the target, creating a special crystalline lock on the object. You can also substitute your spell DC for any of the hazard’s listed DCs. You can have only one such hazard active at a time, and if you cast this spell while a previous electric latch rune is active, the older hazard discharges harmlessly.

**Heightened (+2)** The hazard’s damage increases by `dice: 1d12|avg`.
