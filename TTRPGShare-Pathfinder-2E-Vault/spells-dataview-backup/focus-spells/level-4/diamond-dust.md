**Domain** cold
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Area** 15-foot emanation centered on you
**Saving Throw** basic Fortitude; **Duration** 1 minute

---
You supercool the nearby air, forming a cloud of dancing ice crystals in an emanation around you. A creature other than you that enters the area or ends its turn within the area takes `dice: 2d6|avg` cold damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. The crystals scatter and refract light; if a light effect enters diamond dust’s area, any creatures that effect goes on to affect gain a `dice: 1d20+2|avg|nodice`  status bonus to AC and saves against it. While the spell persists, you can activate or deactivate this aura by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You can Dismiss this spell.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
