---
You understand that holding a secret is in itself a kind of power. Each target must attempt a Will save.

**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** A rune symbolizing a secret the target is keeping (at the GM's discretion) appears floating in front of you. If that creature attempts a Strike or spell attack against you while you hold their secret, you can discharge the rune as a reaction to deal `dice: 7d6|avg` mental damage to the creature.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes convinced you know their secret and takes `dice: 1d6|avg` persistent mental damage from worry. If the rune with the secret is discharged while the creature is still taking the persistent mental damage, the persistent mental damage immediately ends.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 2d6, and the persistent mental damage on a critical failure increases by 1.
