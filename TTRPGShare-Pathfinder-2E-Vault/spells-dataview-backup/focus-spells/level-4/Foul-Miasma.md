**Domain** plague
**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature affected by a disease
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** 1 minute

---
You multiply the disease within a creature, drawing it into an infectious mist outside their body where it can spread to other creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target is willing, it can choose to take the effects of critical failure.

**Critical Success** The target receives the benefit of a successful save against the lowest-level disease affecting it.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** One randomly chosen disease affecting the target fills the air in a 15-foot emanation centered on the target. For the spell’s duration, any creature that enters or ends its turn within the area is exposed to that disease.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except the miasma contains all the diseases affecting the target.
