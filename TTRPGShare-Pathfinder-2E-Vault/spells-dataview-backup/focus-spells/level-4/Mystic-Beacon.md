**Duration** until the start of your next turn

---
The next damaging or healing spell the target casts before the start of your next turn deals damage or restores Hit Points as if the spell were heightened 1 level higher than its actual level.

The spell otherwise functions at its actual level. Once the target casts the spell, mystic beacon ends.
