Your unarmed attacks or weapon gain the benefits of a weapon rune you choose when you cast this spell: [Corrosive](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Corrosive.md), [Flaming](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Flaming.md), [Frost](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Frost.md), [Ghost Touch](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Ghost%20Touch.md), [Returning](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Returning.md), [Shock](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Shock.md), or [Thundering](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Thundering.md). If you cast runic impression on a weapon, this spell ends if you cease holding the weapon.

If this spell would give a weapon more property runes than its normal maximum, one of the existing property runes (you choose) is suppressed until the spell ends.

For [Unarmed](../../../rules/traits/unarmed.md) attacks, if this spell would give you more property runes than you could have from [Handwraps of Mighty Blows](../../../Items/Worn%20Items/Other%20Worn%20Items/Handwraps%20of%20Mighty%20Blows.md), one of the existing property runes is similarly suppressed.

**Heightened (8th)** Add [Keen](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Keen.md) to the list of runes you can choose as well as the greater types of corrosive, flaming, frost, shock, and thundering.
