You evoke the energy of an Abyssal realm. The damage types of the spell (one energy and one physical) are based on the result of rolling on the table below.

| `dice: 1d4` | Realm    | Manifestation                   | Damage Type              |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1           | Skies    | Bolts, lightning, flying debris | Bludgeoning, Electricity |
| 2           | Depths   | Acid, demonic shells            | Acid, Slashing           |
| 3           | Frozen   | Frigid air, ice                 | Bludgeoning, Cold        |
| 4           | Volcanic | Jagged volcanic rock, magma     | Fire, Piercing           |

You deal `dice: 4d6|avg` damage of each of the corresponding damage types to each creature in the cone (`dice: 8d6|avg` total damage).

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage for each type increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
