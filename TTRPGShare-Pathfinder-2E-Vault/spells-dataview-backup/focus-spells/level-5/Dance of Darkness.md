You dance, Striding up to half your Speed. At either the start or end of your Stride, you create an area of magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) in a 10-foot burst centered on your location.

This area is filled with magical darkness that works the same way as that created by a [Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%202/Darkness) spell of the same level. When you create the darkness, attempt a Performance check to dance, with a standard DC for your level, to determine the duration of the darkness.
