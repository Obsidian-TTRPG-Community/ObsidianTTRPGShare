**Domain** zeal
**Cast** ► somatic
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 weapon you're wielding

---
Holding your weapon aloft, you fill it with divine energy. On your next Strike with that weapon before the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll and the weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon has a striking rune, this instead increases the number of dice from the striking rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice).

If the target weapon leaves your possession, weapon surge immediately ends.
