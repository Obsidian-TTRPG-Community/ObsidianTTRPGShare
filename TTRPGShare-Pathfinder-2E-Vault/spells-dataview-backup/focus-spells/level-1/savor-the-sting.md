---
You inflict pain upon the target and revel in their anguish. This deals `dice: 1d4|avg` mental damage and `dice: 1d4|avg` persistent mental damage; the target must attempt a Will save.

As long as the target is taking [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md) from this spell, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks against the target.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes half damage and no persistent damage.
**Failure** The target takes full initial and persistent damage.
**Critical Failure** The target takes double initial and persistent damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by `dice: 1d4|avg` and the persistent damage increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
