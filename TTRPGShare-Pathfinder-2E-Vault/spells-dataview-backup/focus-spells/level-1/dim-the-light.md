**Bloodline** shadow
**Cast** ◄ somatic; Trigger You cast a [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) or shadow spell.

---
You magnify the darkness from the triggering effect, causing the ambient light level to flicker briefly so you can slip from sight. You can immediately attempt a Stealth check to [hide](../../../rules/actions/hide.md), and you can become [Hidden](../../../Conditions/Hidden.md) to a creature even if you don't have cover and aren't otherwise [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) from that creature.

You cease being hidden at the end of your turn unless you move into cover or become concealed before then.
