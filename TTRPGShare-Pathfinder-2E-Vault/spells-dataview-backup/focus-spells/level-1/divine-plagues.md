---
Your deity sends wracking plagues. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. When you Cast the Spell, decide whether the disease inflicts the [Clumsy](../../../Conditions/Clumsy.md), [Enfeebled](../../../Conditions/Enfeebled.md), or [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) condition.

**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The target is afflicted with divine plague at stage 1.
**Critical Failure** The target is afflicted with divine plague at stage 2.

**Divine Plague** ([Disease](../../../rules/traits/disease.md)) Level 1;
- **Stage 1** clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, or stupefied 1 (1 round); 
- **Stage 2** [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 and clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, or stupefied 1 (1 round); 
- **Stage 3** clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, or stupefied 1 and the target can’t recover from the condition until they are cured (1 day)

<hr>

**Heightened (5th)** The divine plague disease gains the virulent trait. The condition value for the clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied condition is 2 instead of 1.
