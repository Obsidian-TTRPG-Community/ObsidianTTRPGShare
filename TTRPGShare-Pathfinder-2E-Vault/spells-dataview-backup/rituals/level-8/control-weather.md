**Cast** 1 day; **Secondary Casters** 1
**Primary Check** Nature (master); **Secondary Check** Survival
**Area** 2-mile-radius circle centered on you
**Duration** `dice: 4d12|avg` hours

You alter the weather, making it calm and normal for the season or choosing up to two effects based on the season:

You can’t specifically control the manifestations, such as the exact path of a tornado or the targets of lightning strikes.
- **Autumn** cold weather, fog, mild heat, sleet
- **Spring** drizzle, heat, hurricane, sleet, thunderstorm, tornado
- **Summer** drizzle, downpour, extreme heat, hail, heat
- **Winter** blizzard, mild cold, extreme cold, thaw

**Critical Success** You change the weather as desired and can affect a larger area (up to a 5-mile-radius circle), or a longer duration (any number of additional d12 hours, up to `dice: 16d12|avg`).
**Success** You change the weather as desired.
**Failure** You fail to change the weather as desired.
**Critical Failure** The weather changes in an unanticipated way, determined by the GM but generally as contradictory to your true desires as possible (for instance, a terrible storm emerges when you would prefer good weather).

**Heightened (9th)** You can create unseasonable weather and contradictory weather effects, such as extreme cold and a hurricane. You can make the weather calm and normal weather for a different season or choose weather effects from any season’s list.
