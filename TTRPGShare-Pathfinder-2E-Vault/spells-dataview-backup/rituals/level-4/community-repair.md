You lead your community in repairing a public work, such as a bridge, well, or mural, through the power of memory and art. The primary caster serves as an emcee or leader, while each secondary caster provides a heartfelt anecdote that somehow involves the public work; for instance, recounting a story of playing at a fountain each summer. 

The anecdotes don't need to be firsthand accounts—a community member might sing of how their grandparents fell in love crossing a bridge every day—but they must be directly connected in some way. The GM can offer a +1 circumstance bonus to the secondary caster whose anecdote seems most moving.

If the public work was destroyed intentionally by one of the casters, the ritual automatically critically fails.

**Critical Success** The public work is restored to its prior construction, and it takes on further qualities, encouraged by the thoughts of the community. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they receive a +1 status bonus to Will saves against emotion effects and a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds.
**Success** The public work is restored to its prior construction and function.
**Failure** The ritual has no effect.
**Critical Failure** The public work refuses to repair itself, and the memories of the community members are soured in response to the botched ritual. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they cannot receive any benefit from beneficial emotion effects, and they take a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds as their movement slows to a morose crawl.
