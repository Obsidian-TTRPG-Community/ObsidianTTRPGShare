You call upon an owb to assist you in a goal. Only caligni callers can use this ritual with relative safety. If a different type of caligni attempts this ritual, they use an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their check. If a non-caligni attempts this ritual, the result is an automatic critical failure.

**Critical Success** You conjure the owb. It decides your goals closely match its own and doesn't request a favor in return.
**Success** You conjure the owb. It isn't eager to pursue the task, so it requires a favor in return.
**Failure** You don't conjure an owb.
**Critical Failure** You conjure an owb, but it deems you unworthy and siphons away some of your soul energy. All casters become [Doomed](../../../Conditions/Doomed.md) 2.
