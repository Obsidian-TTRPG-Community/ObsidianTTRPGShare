# Chapter 1: Essentials of Magic
<sup>SoM p. 7</sup>

> [!pf2-sidebar] Magical Backgrounds
> 
> Starting on page 28 are new backgrounds that have a particular magical bent. As with many backgrounds, these can work with all sorts of characters, from those who went on to be spellcasters to others who dabbled in magic but ended up choosing a different path.
> 
> You might also want to look at the following backgrounds from the _Core Rulebook_ and _Advanced Player's Guide_.
> 
> **Core Rulebook**: [Acolyte](../../compendium/character/backgrounds/acolyte.md), [animal whisperer](../../compendium/character/backgrounds/animal-whisperer.md), [fortune teller](../../compendium/character/backgrounds/fortune-teller.md), [herbalist](../../compendium/character/backgrounds/herbalist.md), [hermit](../../compendium/character/backgrounds/hermit.md), [scholar](../../compendium/character/backgrounds/scholar.md)

> ### Rare Backgrounds
> <sup>SoM p. 7</sup>
> 
> Some of these magical backgrounds require atypical magical events in a character's past (such as the circumstances of their birth); these are rare backgrounds, and you'll need to work with your GM if you'd like to take one of them. Rare backgrounds start on page 30.

## Tradition Treatises
<sup>SoM p. 7</sup>

- **Principals of Elementary Thaumaturgy (page 8):** Arcane scholars are prone to stultifying pedantry, digging into every bit of minutiae. Toff Ornelos is among the few to present anything approaching a text suitable for beginners.
- **Journeys of the Spirit and Flesh (page 10):** The divine tradition is as varied in practice as the many gods that empower it. Zorahar the Wandering Cleric compiled an absolutely massive study of different Nethysian subfaiths. I thought a sampling would be enlightening.
- **A Letter from Djavin Vhrest (page 12):** Scholarship on the occult tradition can melt your mind to a puddle (figuratively, for the most part). Luckily, I possess a letter from a foremost curator in my discipline: Djavin Vhrest of the Forae Logos.
- **On Primal Practice (page 14):** Primal theorists publish almost nothing—they prefer an oral tradition held within secret druidic circles—though I did find this kindly letter. As it's from one family member to another, I find it especially fitting I now place it in your hands, my dear.

## Rare Magical Backgrounds
<sup>SoM p. 30</sup>

These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly different roleplaying experience by setting their character up with a history or legacy beyond the norm. Whether a character with the chosen one background has been prophesied to achieve a goal that's part of the main plot of the campaign or a side quest just for them, the character is situated in a special position within the narrative. Your character's background is an intrinsic part of where they come from and not something they earn during the game. Rare backgrounds should be chosen only after a discussion between the GM and the other players as to whether one would apply for a particular character in your group's game.
