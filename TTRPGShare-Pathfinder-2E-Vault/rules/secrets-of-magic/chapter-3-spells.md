# Chapter 3: Spells
<sup>SoM p. 79</sup>

> [!pf2-sidebar] Rune Manifestations
> 
> The runes that manifest around a caster's hands during spellcasting express the baseline characteristics of invoked magical energies—a common, albeit vaguely understood phenomenon. Scholars have confirmed that these symbols represent schools of magic or power sources, changing to reflect a magical undertaking's complexity. While spellcasters from the same traditions can manifest similar runes—for example, bards invoking runes that resemble musical notes—the exact aesthetic represents an individual's personality and experience, evolving as a spellcaster develops. The study of runes common in the Thassilonian empire originally began as an attempt to use these runic manifestations to comprehend the language of magic and the nature of the universe.

> ### Spell Lists
> <sup>SoM p. 79</sup>
> 
> The following eight pages list the new spells of each tradition. (Focus spells for magus and summoner appear on pages 143–145.) A superscript "H" indicates a spell has extra effects when heightened, and a spell whose rarity is greater than common has a superscript with the first letter of that rarity. An abbreviation in parentheses indicates the spell's school.

> [!pf2-sidebar] Targeting Companions and Eidolons
> 
> Some spells in this chapter can affect the caster's companion or eidolon. When "companion" is used in a stat block, it refers to animal companions, familiars, and future types of companions—such as construct companions—but not eidolons. Some spells are even more specific. For example, if the spell says, "**Targets** your familiar," you could cast it only on a familiar, not other kinds of companions. If you Cast a Spell that can benefit only a type of creature you don't have, such as Casting a Spell that can target only an eidolon when you don't have an eidolon, the spell does nothing.
> 
> If the spell would affect an ability the creature doesn't have, the spell doesn't give the creature that ability unless the spell says it does. For example, a spell that causes your companion to make a Strike wouldn't let a familiar make a Strike but would give it all other benefits of the spell.
> 
> The spells in this section that can target companions or eidolons are: [clone companion](../../compendium/spells/clone-companion-som.md), [envenom companion](../../compendium/spells/envenom-companion-som.md), [juvenile companion](../../compendium/spells/juvenile-companion-som.md), [protect companion](../../compendium/spells/protect-companion-som.md), [rapid adaptation](../../compendium/spells/rapid-adaptation-som.md), [summoner's precaution](../../compendium/spells/summoners-precaution-som.md), [summoner's visage](../../compendium/spells/summoners-visage-som.md), [thundering dominance](../../compendium/spells/thundering-dominance-som.md), and [timely tutor](../../compendium/spells/timely-tutor-som.md).

> [!pf2-sidebar] Incarnate Spells
> 
> A spell with the incarnate trait is similar in theme to spells that summon creatures, but it doesn't conjure a minion with the summoned trait. Instead, when summoned, the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish Casting the Spell. At the end of your next turn, the incarnate creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another movement type it has (such as Climb or Burrow), and then takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the word "Arrive" or "Depart" respectively, along with any traits.
> 
> A creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines what the incarnate would do. It might even become more inclined to do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings.
> 
> The incarnate is not fully a creature. It can't take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by [Strikes](../actions/strike.md), spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as [dispel magic](../../compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md)). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it doesn't block movement. If applicable, its effects use your spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.

## Rituals
<sup>SoM p. 147</sup>

> [!pf2-note]
> Please visit the rituals page to view all Rituals from Secrets of Magic.

> [!pf2-brown] Sympathetic Magic
> 
> Some rituals work by exploiting magical bonds created between two creatures or a creature and an object tied to them with some kind of personal connection, such as a possession or lock of hair, in a style of spellcasting known as sympathetic magic. Sympathetic magic can be a tool for great good, binding the souls of a guardian and his ward together until a noble quest is completed, or for great evil, hiding assassins from the sight of an otherwise competent watcher.

> [!pf2-brown] Empathy, Sympathy, and Hate
> 
> Sympathetic magic draws much of its power from emotional and spiritual forces, which is one of the reasons it's more likely to be harnessed in occult rituals than any other magical tradition. Strong emotions directed towards the target of the ritual, such as love or empathy for a beloved ally or hatred for an unrelenting enemy, are often key to determining the ritual's success and effectiveness.
> 
> Powerful emotions from enough people can even give rise to such effects without a formalized ritual. In the orcish hold of Belkzen, Ardax the White-Hair rules the orcs with an iron fist and defies powerful runelords and magical tyrants with impunity. Some scholars posit that the collective emotions of the Belkzen orcs united under Ardax might have formed a pseudo sympathetic ritual with enough power to deflect the hateful spells of the wizards who would rather see Ardax removed from his position of leadership.
