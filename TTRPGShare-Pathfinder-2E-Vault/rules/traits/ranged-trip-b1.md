# Ranged Trip  
*Source: Bestiary p. 85*  

The weapon can be used to [Trip](../actions/trip.md) with the [Athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check is attempted with a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to [Trip](../actions/trip.md), a ranged trip weapon doesn't deal any damage when used to [Trip](../actions/trip.md). This trait usually appears only on a [thrown](thrown.md) weapon.
