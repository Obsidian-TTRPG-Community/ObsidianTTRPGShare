# Additive  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 75*  

Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an [infused](infused.md) [alchemical](alchemical.md) item, and some can be used only with the [Quick Alchemy](../actions/quick-alchemy.md) action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive <2>. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.
