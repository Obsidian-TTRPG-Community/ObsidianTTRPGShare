# Composition  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 629*  

To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you usually use a type of [Performance](../../compendium/skills.md#Performance). If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an [auditory](auditory.md) performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a [visual](visual.md) one. The spell gains all the traits of the performance you used. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately.
