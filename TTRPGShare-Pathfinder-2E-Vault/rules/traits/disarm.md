# Disarm  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 282*  

You can use this weapon to [Disarm](../actions/disarm.md) with the [Athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the [Athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.
