# Magical  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 633*  

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.

Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the [arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md), or [primal](primal.md) trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.
