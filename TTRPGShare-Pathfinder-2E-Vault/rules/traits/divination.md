# Divination  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 631*  

The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.

Divinations allow you to learn the secrets of the present, past, and future. They bestow good fortune, grant you the ability to perceive remote locations, and reveal secret knowledge.

Divinations often have the detection trait if they find something, the [prediction](prediction.md) trait if they grant you insight about what might happen in the future, the [revelation](revelation.md) trait if they show things as they truly are, or the [scrying](scrying.md) trait if they let you perceive another location.
