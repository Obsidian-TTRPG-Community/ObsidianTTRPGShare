# True Name  
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 244*  

Certain spells, feats, and items have the true name trait. This trait means they require you to know a creature's true name to use them. But even without these specialized abilities, knowing a creature's true name gives you certain advantages. If you know a creature's true name, you have a +2 circumstance bonus to the following checks.

- Checks to [Recall Knowledge](../actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the creature
- [Arcana](../../compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](../../compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](../../compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](../../compendium/skills.md#Religion) checks relating to the creature, such as [Deciphering its Writing](../actions/decipher-writing.md), [Identifying its Magic](../actions/identify-magic.md), or [Learning its Spells](../actions/learn-a-spell.md)
- [Deception](../../compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), and [Intimidation](../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks used on or related to the creature, such as to [Coerce](../actions/coerce.md) it, [Gather Information](../actions/gather-information.md) on it, or [Impersonate](../actions/impersonate.md) it
