# Metamagic  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 634*  

Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before [Casting the Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md) you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than [Cast a Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md) directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
