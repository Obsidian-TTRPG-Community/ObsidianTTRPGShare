# Contingency  
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 252*  

Spells with this trait grant you an action during the spell's effects, typically a reaction with a special trigger. They typically have a long duration, such as 24 hours. You can have only one spell with the contingency trait, or one [contingency](../../compendium/spells/contingency.md) spell, active at a time. If you cast another spell with the contingency trait or [contingency](../../compendium/spells/contingency.md), the newer casting supersedes the older.
