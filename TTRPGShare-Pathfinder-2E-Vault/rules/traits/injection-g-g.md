# Injection  
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 233*  

This weapon can be filled with an injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with the weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison with a single [Interact](../actions/interact.md) action. Refilling the weapon with a new substance requires three [Interact](../actions/interact.md) actions and uses both hands.
