# Enchantment  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 631*  

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the enchantment school of magic, typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and other mental effects.

Enchantments affect the minds and emotions of other creatures—sometimes to influence and control them, and other times to bolster them to greater heights of courage. Enchantment spells almost always have the [mental](mental.md) trait, and many have the [emotion](emotion.md) trait or the [fear](fear.md) trait.
