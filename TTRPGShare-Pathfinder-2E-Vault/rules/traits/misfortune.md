# Misfortune  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 634*  

A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a [fortune](fortune.md) effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
