# Unarmed  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 283*  

An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be [Disarmed](../actions/disarm.md). It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon.
