# Conjuration  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 630*  

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the conjuration school of magic, typically involving summoning, creation, [teleportation](teleportation.md), or moving things from place to place.

Conjuration spells transport creatures via teleportation, create an object, or bring a creature or object from somewhere else (typically from another plane) to follow your commands.

Conjuration spells often have the [teleportation](teleportation.md) trait, and the creatures summoned by conjuration spells have the [summoned](summoned.md) trait.
