# Character Options
<sup>LOGM p. 102</sup>

A character's faith or philosophy can shape them in powerful ways both fundamental and peripheral, from the cleric who receives spells by the grace of their deity to a champion who fights tyranny wielding a weapon imbued with divine power to a raging barbarian who cares only that their companions' [divine](../traits/divine.md) healing keeps them in the fight. In a world rife with [divine](../traits/divine.md) magic, only a few rare individuals live without considering how faith affects their lives—even if that consideration means working in opposition to the divine. The gifts and curses of the gods filter down through all aspects of life, from the truly world-shaking powers of the mightiest clerics to the minor miracles performed by righteous crusaders and wicked priests to the everyday minutiae of a common acolyte.

While any character can express their faith through their actions, the options presented in this chapter provide ways for a character to incorporate their convictions into their abilities as well. New domains and domain spells expand a cleric's options beyond those listed in the _Pathfinder Core Rulebook_. New spells grant specialized abilities to clerics and other spellcasters, while new feats, weapons, and gear provide ways for characters of any class and philosophy to embrace and express their ideology.

Many of the new rules presented in this section are closely related to a single deity or domain, but in some cases, they're simply more common among a given faith, and practitioners of any faith can make use of them if they can gain access. Priests of [Brigh](../../compendium/setting/deities/brigh-logm.md) might develop the formula for a revolutionary magic item available to the faithful, but that doesn't mean they won't ever trade it in exchange for information about another creator's inventions. Similarly, priests of [Nalinivati](../../compendium/setting/deities/nalinivati-logm.md) certainly aren't the only warriors who wield [urumis](../../compendium/equipment/items/urumi-logm.md), but they are in part responsible for the popularity of the weapon across the Inner Sea region, and the [polytool](../../compendium/equipment/items/polytool-logm.md) is only one of numerous innovations emerging from Numeria.

In addition to seeking access to options simply more common among other faiths, if you'd like to incorporate an option limited to a faith other than the one your character holds, work with your GM to make sure your use of that option works with the campaign and doesn't diminish the choices of other characters who might worship the original deity who grants that option. If so, you and the GM might work together to alter certain aspects of a feat, spell, item, or other option to ensure it fits your faith and makes sense within the larger story you want to tell.

## Feats
<sup>LOGM p. 102</sup>

Feats can be used to customize a character in several specific ways, whether by expanding the options available to a character whose class is already tied to a deity, or by granting ways for a character with an unrelated class to incorporate a philosophy into their suite of abilities. Some of the feats presented here enhance a follower's powers, while other abilities arise among those working to foil or deceive the faithful. This section includes general feats, skill feats, and a small number of more specialized class feats.

## Spells
<sup>LOGM p. 103</sup>

Divine spellcasters can call a deity's might to their fingertips, acting as a worldly conduit for divine wrath or redemption—but not just anyone can call the power of the gods. Some of the spells in this section are new additions to the [divine](../traits/divine.md) spell list, and thus they can be cast by any clerics, sorcerers whose bloodlines grant [divine](../traits/divine.md) spells, or other characters with access to [divine](../traits/divine.md) spells. Others are more commonly used by bards, druids, sorcerers, wizards, and other characters with access to spellcasting, but can be granted to worshippers of a specific deity as a blessing to the faithful.

## Domains and Domain Spells
<sup>LOGM p. 103</sup>

This section provides a number of new domains, as well as basic and advanced domain spells for each of these new domains. Several of the gods presented in this book rely upon the new domains listed here, but several of the entries for the more common deities on Golarion list some of the domains in this section as alternate domains, representing lesser-known or niche aspects of the deity. Followers of these deities can take the [Expanded Domain Initiate](../../compendium/feats/expanded-domain-initiate-logm.md) or [Splinter Faith](../../compendium/feats/splinter-faith-logm.md) feats to gain access to alternate domains and their associated spells. GMs may instead prefer to take inspiration from the rules in the [Splinter Faith](../../compendium/feats/splinter-faith-logm.md) feat to present new approaches to existing faiths or altogether new faiths.

## Items and Weapons
<sup>LOGM p. 103</sup>

The final section of this chapter provides rules for a number of new items, both magical and non-magical, suitable for characters who operate closely within a faith or philosophy—or those who oppose them! The deities in this book are revered across all of Golarion, with some having origins or centers of worship far removed from the Inner Sea region. As such, many of these deities favor weapons not commonly found around the Inner Sea.

In addition to the new weapons, this section presents a variety of exciting items to give all characters the means to express their faith and make their mark on the world, from simple trinkets to powerful items granted to the most favored of a god's servants.

## Appendix
<sup>LOGM p. 103</sup>

The tables at the end of this book list dozens of other deities whose faiths are prominent in the Age of Lost Omens. The chart provides the basic details required for a worshipper, such as permitted alignments, edicts, and anathema. GMs and players are encouraged to use the tables as inspiration for characters and new deities.

## Feats
<sup>LOGM p. 104</sup>

While champions and clerics have clear ties to their chosen deities and gain definitive benefits from them, they don't hold a monopoly on such abilities. The following feats represent ways all characters might benefit from adherence to a deity or a particular philosophy—as well as feats for characters who oppose the faithful.

## Domains
<sup>LOGM p. 112</sup>

Though each god wields great power over many aspects of the universe, their focus tends toward specific areas of concern, known as domains. Worshippers who devote themselves to a deity may be granted access to secret spells, known as domain spells, through which they can manifest a sliver of their deity's power and work great feats of magic.

This section presents spells for 18 new domains.
