# Overview
<sup>LOGM p. 6</sup>

A defining characteristic of fantasy as a genre is the presence and use of magic—a fantasy roleplaying game without magic would be like a science fiction story without technology or a horror story without fear! Pathfinder posits four traditions of magic: arcane, divine, occult, and primal. For a faithful character, divine magic is usually the most intrinsically appealing, as it reflects a direct connection to a deity.

Divine magic is the intersection of the instinctual and faith-based vital essence that rules over life and death, and the otherworldly spiritual essence that forms the building blocks of all souls. It can close wounds in seconds, call down blasts of divine vengeance, uncover hidden truths, reveal the future, and even temporarily turn a devotee into an avatar of their god. The idea of divine might invokes images of a righteous crusader, but neutral and evil gods similarly imbue their devotees with power to further their own causes. The divine tradition also encompasses spiritual philosophies that don't involve any specific deity, as well as pantheons of multiple deities.

This book presents an in-depth look at the gods presented in 8 of the _Pathfinder Core Rulebook_, including alternate domains and divine intercessions each god grants. Following that are 20 additional gods, with rules for playing their clerics and champions, including how to assume the forms of their mighty avatars. Following these entries, this book describes demigod pantheons, such as the Eldest and the empyreal lords, as well as spiritual philosophies, including the [Green Faith](../../compendium/setting/deities/green-faith.md) and [Sangpotshi](../../compendium/setting/deities/sangpotshi-logm.md). This book also includes exciting new domains, feats, items, spells, and weapons useful for many characters, not just clerics.

## Why Belief Matters
<sup>LOGM p. 6</sup>

Faith is important in any fantasy world where mortals can wield divine power. On Golarion, the existence of the gods is not a speculative question. To the contrary, the veracity of each of the gods is demonstrable, visible through manifestations ranging from powerful divine spells to portentous curses and boons.

Belief and devotion shape life on Golarion in numerous ways. Generally, the gods imbue their most devoted followers with their magic. A cleric's adherence to the principles and observances of their god underpins their ability to access the divine magic that powers their spells. A champion forges their very identity in devotion to their deity and cause, from which they draw their righteous zeal. Other mortals often view with awe those characters commanding divine power through such intense piety.

Yet these are exceptional cases, and more mundane faith is common. A fighter might worship [Kurgess](../../compendium/setting/deities/kurgess-logm.md), the god of healthy competition and physical development, while a barbarian similarly follows [Gorum](../../compendium/setting/deities/gorum.md), the god of strength and battle, each finding inspiration for their personal growth and values in their worship. Wilderness-roaming characters, such as rangers and druids (whose magic derives from primal forces rather than the divine), may feel drawn to the [Green Faith](../../compendium/setting/deities/green-faith.md) or [Shoanti animism](../../compendium/setting/deities/shoanti-animism-logm.md) as an expression of their connection to the earth—or they might venerate [Gozreh](../../compendium/setting/deities/gozreh.md), the god of nature; [Sarenrae](../../compendium/setting/deities/sarenrae.md), the goddess of the sun; or [Tsukiyo](../../compendium/setting/deities/tsukiyo-logm.md), the god of the moon. Scholarly characters, such as alchemists and wizards, may recognize that religious devotions provide them with a connection to community, a sense of purpose, or even a path to greater personal power. They might worship a deity associated with intellectual pursuits, like the god of magic, [Nethys](../../compendium/setting/deities/nethys.md), or they might enjoy established and well-connected churches, such as those of [Abadar](../../compendium/setting/deities/abadar.md), the god of cities and wealth; [Iomedae](../../compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md), the goddess of justice and honor; or [Asmodeus](../../compendium/setting/deities/asmodeus.md), the god of tyranny and pride. Sorcerers and bards, on the other hand, might be inspired to worship [Shelyn](../../compendium/setting/deities/shelyn.md), the goddess of art and love; [Desna](../../compendium/setting/deities/desna.md), the goddess of luck and travel; or even [Cayden Cailean](../../compendium/setting/deities/cayden-cailean.md), the god of freedom and alcohol. Devotion might be woven into their self-expression, or it could provide a connection to like-minded followers, or give them a deeper sense of purpose. Characters who rely on perfecting their skills, such as rogues and monks, might be drawn to the worship of [Irori](../../compendium/setting/deities/irori.md), the god of knowledge and self-perfection—or of [Norgorber](../../compendium/setting/deities/norgorber.md), the god of secret knowledge and thievery.

While most characters faithful enough to gain power from their deity do so in service to a single god or goddess, most people on Golarion venerate many deities, giving praise or asking for aid based on the circumstances of their lives. The focus of a person's faith may change as circumstances do. A barbarian might have a central devotion to [Chaldira](../../compendium/setting/deities/chaldira-logm.md), the halfling god of battle and luck, but add prayers to [Shelyn](../../compendium/setting/deities/shelyn.md), god of beauty and love, when she finds true love. Upon the untimely death of her lover, she may turn to [Pharasma](../../compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md), god of death and fate, or to [Desna](../../compendium/setting/deities/desna.md), god of dreams, to ease her grief—or to [Calistria](../../compendium/setting/deities/calistria.md), god of vengeance, to repay the death. Similarly, a dishonored politician might continue to honor [Gruhastha](../../compendium/setting/deities/gruhastha-logm.md) the Keeper but offer a prayer to [Achaekek](../../compendium/setting/deities/achaekek-logm.md), the mantis god of assassins and death, to regain her power.

## The Role of the Gods
<sup>LOGM p. 7</sup>

As befits a reality in which gods and magic are demonstrable, the deities of the Pathfinder setting are not aloof constructs whose power merely provides options for character creation. They are deeply involved in the fabric of reality, shaping the course of Golarion's people in particular. Ascension to godhood is a real and living thing on Golarion; deities including [Arazni](../../compendium/setting/deities/arazni-logm.md), [Cayden Cailean](../../compendium/setting/deities/cayden-cailean.md), [Iomedae](../../compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md), [Norgorber](../../compendium/setting/deities/norgorber.md), and most recently [Casandalee](../../compendium/setting/deities/casandalee-logm.md) were mortals on Golarion who ascended to become deities. Others, such as [Abadar](../../compendium/setting/deities/abadar.md) and [Sarenrae](../../compendium/setting/deities/sarenrae.md), have their homes in other planes and predate Golarion's existence, yet they nevertheless take an active interest in its workings.

Political upheavals can favor particular gods, and some show deities' direct influence. Cheliax's pact with [Asmodeus](../../compendium/setting/deities/asmodeus.md) has inarguably extended his diabolical influence across the Inner Sea region. The success of the undead nation of Geb is a boon to [Urgathoa](../../compendium/setting/deities/urgathoa.md), while simultaneously offering endless worry to [Pharasma](../../compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md) and her legions of psychopomps. The destruction of Lastwall was a blow to [Iomedae](../../compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md), greatly reducing her influence in that region. While these gods also have myriad extraplanar and extra-worldly concerns beyond mortal consideration, they are still—to varying degrees and at various times—deeply invested in the dramas playing out across Golarion, and they manifest their will accordingly.

Despite a long and deep divine connection to Golarion, it is extremely rare for a god to appear in the world. The gift of divine power is the most common way in which the gods influence mortal (as well as undead and immortal) lives on the planet. Divine intercession, through the granting of boons and curses, is another way in which the gods spread their influence. Golarion's deities don't spend the majority of their time doling out curses and boons, nor does every god pay attention to every mortal—no god has that much time amid their plots and alliances playing out on an extraplanar scale. Yet when their attention is attracted through particular merit or outrage, or when it fits into a larger objective, they may intercede to bless or to curse a mortal who has drawn their attention. Finally, a god might speak to a mortal through a dream, portent, or singular religious experience. Such moments can shape a character's deepest values and motives, and they are entirely at the GM's discretion.

Campaigns set on worlds other than Golarion can still use the rules and information found in this book to deepen religious themes. The gods exert their influence across the multiverse, and they might enact dramas similar to those described here on any world of the GM's creation. Alternatively, different gods might take the center stage in another world's pantheon, or they might have entirely different relationships. On a different world, [Rovagug](../../compendium/setting/deities/rovagug.md) might be the primary deity and principal villain behind truly monstrous schemes, and [Nethys](../../compendium/setting/deities/nethys.md)—in his role as a destroyer—might support the Rough Beast.

## Rules Elements
<sup>LOGM p. 7</sup>

This book presents the following new rules elements.

### Alternate Domains
<sup>LOGM p. 7</sup>

Each deity grants four domains—these are their primary domains. Some deities, however, have such expansive jurisdiction that more than four domains are appropriate for them. Many of these alternate domains are available only to characters who specialize in these areas, as they often fall outside of their deity's main purposes or areas of focus. This book lists alternate domains a deity may have. Followers of a deity do not initially have access to these alternate domains, but a cleric can take the [Expanded Domain Initiate](../../compendium/feats/expanded-domain-initiate-logm.md) feat on the following page to gain access to one of their deity's alternate domains, and either a cleric or a champion from an unusual branch of their faith can take the [Splinter Faith](../../compendium/feats/splinter-faith-logm.md) feat below to redefine the domains available to them.

![Expanded Domain Initiate](../../compendium/feats/expanded-domain-initiate-logm.md)

![Splinter Faith](../../compendium/feats/splinter-faith-logm.md)

### Changing Faith
<sup>LOGM p. 8</sup>

Whether dramatic or gradual, a character may have a crisis of faith or even a fall from grace. When this happens, the character is no longer able to use the spells, feats, and other class features tied to their now-lost faith. As reflects the genuine struggle within their soul, such characters may find themselves hobbled in their actions and interactions until they are restored to good standing via the atone ritual—or, in the case of a more complete break, until they retrain.

[Retraining](../actions/retraining.md) requires substantial downtime—in most cases, at least a month. A character who wishes to [retrain](../actions/retraining.md) into a different faith with similar concerns and domains requires less time to convert than a character moving into a radically divergent faith. Thus, a cleric of [Grandmother Spider](../../compendium/setting/deities/grandmother-spider-logm.md) might move to the worship of [Calistria](../../compendium/setting/deities/calistria.md) with a month's tutelage and service in one of her temples. However, that same cleric of [Grandmother Spider](../../compendium/setting/deities/grandmother-spider-logm.md) could not so easily become a priest of [Asmodeus](../../compendium/setting/deities/asmodeus.md), even though both deities share the trickery domain—their longstanding animosity is reflected in their diametrically opposed doctrines and cultures. Such a conversion is not impossible but could take several months of downtime or happen piecemeal over months of in-game development. In some instances, particularly in the case of PCs or other high-profile targets of conversion, a new deity might send an emissary directly to a character struggling with a crisis of faith in order to tempt that character to righteousness or villainy. In these cases, the emissary might be able to offer a near-immediate transformation as an enticement, funneling vital and spiritual essence primed to the deity's philosophy into the converting character to remove the need for any downtime at all. Such a transformation is not without risks, however, and may come with complications down the line.

At the GM's discretion, characters for whom divine patronage is essential but who lose faith completely can [retrain](../actions/retraining.md) into a new class. A champion might retrain as a fighter or a ranger, swapping out faith-based feats and class features for appropriate analogues. The length of downtime required in any of these cases is at the GM's discretion, though the player and GM are advised to work together to determine a suitable time frame that does not fully interrupt play and can help tell a satisfying story.

### Divine Intercession
<sup>LOGM p. 9</sup>

To make their influence on Golarion felt directly—but without manifesting on the planet in all their divine glory—each god has the tool of divine intercession. Divine intercession manifests as a boon or a curse, of varying duration and power, visited upon a mortal. Curses are not triggered simply by doing something a god does not like, or everyone in Golarion would be cursed all the time; they are often reserved for followers of the god who commit anathema that aren't strong enough to warrant ejection from the faith, or those who have committed shocking blasphemies. Conversely, an unaffiliated worshipper embroiled in high-profile actions that are anathema to a god could earn a curse. Similarly, boons are not automatically granted to anyone petitioning the god. Certainly, someone who upholds a deity's edicts could earn a boon, especially when acting under adverse circumstances. Most often, as befits their inscrutable nature, a deity will bestow a boon or a curse for their own reasons. Perhaps a mission is of dire importance to a god's plan for a specific place or people, or perhaps the survival of a particular character figures in their plans decades from now.

The divine intercessions provided in each entry are examples, and the GM can have any deity grant a different effect than the intercessions provided. These intercessions are special and are always at the deity's, and thus the GM's, direct discretion, with the GM deciding when a boon or curse goes into effect. The GM is also at liberty to remove a boon or curse as is appropriate for the game's story. A PC or NPC can never select a feat, spell, or other rules option that entitles them to a divine boon or bestows a divine curse upon foes. Minor intercessions are memorable for the recipient, providing either a relatively modest and long-lasting effect or a spectacular but fleeting one. Moderate intercessions are hugely significant events that typically come with permanent consequences, and major intercessions can pivotally reshape a recipient's life, granting powers wildly beyond their innate abilities or inflicting life-changing curses.

#### Creating New Intercession
<sup>LOGMWS p. 2</sup>

The intercessions presented in _Lost Omens Gods & Magic_ and in this document provide intercessions for the featured deities of the Inner Sea region. However, the people of Golarion worship countless deities, including those that may not already have intercessions listed. If you wish to create new intercessions for these other deities or even new deities of your own design, here are a few suggestions.

**Balance:** Deities are all-powerful beings in the Age of Lost Omens, capable of feats far beyond those that any PC or NPC could ever achieve. However, even with this unlimited power and potential, deities tend to only use a fraction of their abilities to help or hinder mortals. A good guideline to determine the power and capability of a boon or curse is to look at the effects of spells and rituals. Minor effects should be on par with a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell or ritual. Use 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-level spells and rituals as a guideline for moderate effects. Major effects should probably be equivalent to a 7th-, 8th-, or 9th-level spell or ritual.

The effects of intercessions tend to be instantaneous or last a single combat at most. As these effects aren't spells, feel free to be a bit more liberal with the power of the effects, however. For example, an intercession that [quickens](../conditions.md#Quickened) a creature but grants the creature 2 additional actions instead of 1 is more powerful than a standard [haste](../../compendium/spells/haste.md) spell, but would probably still serve well as a moderate boon. Any effects that last much longer should probably remain closer to the power of a spell or ritual. Deities can be fickle, though, so feel free to enhance, reduce, or outright remove any effect that isn't working how you would like.

**Frequency:** Repeated use of divine intercessions will quickly cause them to lose their luster. Deities tend to avoid interceding for the most part and will only do so on rare occasions. If PCs started receiving boons with every prayer, the intercessions would eventually lose what makes them unique and become just another "buff" that the PCs use in their everyday adventures. Try to keep intercessions restricted to key moments of drama or as rewards for significant events in your campaign.

In addition, try to avoid keeping long-lasting intercessions in effect for too long. A PC that earns a boon might only keep it until their deity's will is done, such as after the slaying of a significant enemy. A cursed PC could lose their curse after a genuine attempt to atone and seek forgiveness for their misdeeds against a deity. Typically, one level's worth of adventuring or a significant story milestone is a good place to remove the effects of an intercession. Allowing a PC to keep the effects of an intercession for longer has effects on the overall balance of play, either in or against the PC's favor. However, in the end, your group can decide what's best. A group of divinely mandated characters each with a unique boon from their respective deity can make for a truly exciting and heroic game!

**Theme:** Most important of all is that any new intercession matches the theme of the deity who grants it. In some cases, a thematic and flavorful intercession is more interesting than a simple numerical bonus. For example, [Iomedae's](../../compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md) minor boon allows a PC to remain clean and tidy at all times, regardless of what events they undergo. This has no mechanical effect but ties into [Iomedae's](../../compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md) themes of purity and valor. Minor boons are a great place for effects such as these. Rather than granting a bonus to Diplomacy checks, consider having the boon allow a PC to be heard by anyone who can see them, enabling them to influence others at a distance.

Beyond making these unique abilities, you can always choose to provide existing effects that are thematic. A storm deity might grant the ability to cast [chain lightning](../../compendium/spells/chain-lightning.md) as an innate spell. Beyond that, you can also restrict specific effects to their more thematic elements. The same storm deity could grant [elemental form](../../compendium/spells/elemental-form.md), but restrict the form to only that of an air elemental. Finally, feel free to tweak the flavor or effects of a spell or ritual to better match the associated deity. The storm deity could grant [fireball](../../compendium/spells/fireball.md) but have it become a spell named _thunderclap_, using the original spell's mechanics but changing the damage type from fire to sonic. Tweaking existing effects in this way can help you create new intercessions with relatively little work, especially in cases where you feel an intercession is needed on short notice.

### New Background
<sup>LOGM p. 9</sup>

The following background is available to characters of any class. Each deity stat block in this book presents a pair of associated ability scores that this background can boost in its Divine Ability entry.

![Raised by Belief](../../compendium/character/backgrounds/raised-by-belief-logm.md)

### Favored Weapon
<sup>LOGM p. 9</sup>

Each deity has a favored weapon. These weapons are not restricted for use by their clerics and champions alone; lay worshippers often train with and wield them in battle as another way to show their devotion. Each of the favored weapons detailed in this book is available to any character with access to it. The same is true of the divine items included in this book.

### Theme Templates
<sup>LOGM p. 9</sup>

Theme templates (introduced in the _Lost Omens Character Guide_) allow a GM to replicate creatures and NPCs that worship specific deities. When you add a theme template that grants many additional abilities, you should consider removing one or more of the creature's original abilities to compensate, or raising the creature's level by 1 and adjusting its statistics accordingly so as to add the template's abilities without taking anything away. Either way, a template adds abilities based on the creature's final level; for example, if you raised a 6th-level creature to 7th level, adjusted its numbers, and added a template, it would gain the 7th-level or higher template abilities. A deity's theme template works as follows.

**All Creatures:** Add any traits in the deity's alignment. Remove any alignment traits not in the deity's alignment.

**1st Level or Higher:** Add the deity's favored weapon and a wooden religious symbol of the deity to the creature's items. Add a favored weapon [Strike](../actions/strike.md) with an attack bonus equal to the creature's highest melee or ranged [Strike](../actions/strike.md) (whichever is appropriate). If the favored weapon is simple, increase the damage die of that Strike by one step.

**4th Level or Higher:** The creature can cast the initial domain spell of one of the deity's domains and gains a pool of 1 Focus Point.

**7th Level or Higher:** The creature can cast the 1st-level spell the deity grants clerics three times per day as a [divine](../traits/divine.md) innate spell.

**12th Level or Higher:** The creature can cast the advanced domain spell of the domain you chose for 4th level or higher, and its focus pool increases to 2 Focus Points.

**17th Level or Higher:** The creature has been truly blessed. Either the creature can cast the deity's other deity spells of up to 7th level once per day each as [divine](../traits/divine.md) innate spells, or, at the GM's discretion, the creature gains the benefits of one of the deity's boons.
