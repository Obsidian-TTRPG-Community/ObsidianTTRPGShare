# Gods of the Inner Sea
<sup>LOGM p. 10</sup>

The gods venerated—or feared—by the people of the Inner Sea region are as diverse as the people themselves. This chapter provides information about many of the gods that are important in the region and beyond. While the 20 primary deities of the Inner Sea region are well known due to either widespread worship or their historical tendency to help or harm the people who live there, the other 20 gods detailed in this chapter grant their worshippers just as much power and are just as important in their worshippers' lives.

## Using the Entries
<sup>LOGM p. 10</sup>

The entries for deities in this book use one of the two stat block formats described below to present the vital information required for worship, depending on the prominence of the particular deity. Additional information useful for playing a champion, cleric, or worshipper of one of the 20 core deities is available in 8 of the _Pathfinder Core Rulebook_.

### Core Deities
<sup>LOGM p. 10</sup>

The entries for the 20 deities who are most influential in the Inner Sea region present information useful for understanding those gods. Each entry includes three boons and three curses the god might use to express their approval of or displeasure at a specific deed; the power of these intercessions varies between deities, depending on their specific focuses and interest in mortal concerns. Each section also begins with statistics for the deity, which use the following format.

> [!pf2-note]
> Please note that many of these statistics are found in the _Lore_ tab on the deities page.

**Name:** The deity's name plus a common title or epithet.

**Alignment:** The deity's alignment and areas of concern.

**Realm:** Where the deity and the souls of their deceased faithful live among the Outer Planes, including the name of the god's divine realm, if they have one.

**Allies:** Gods this deity has good working or personal relationships with and whom they can call on for aid.

**Enemies:** Gods this deity often comes into conflict with due to philosophical differences, conflicts in aims, or personal vendettas.

**Relationships:** Gods the deity has the most important connections to, including siblings, lovers, or other vital relationships. This section is omitted if it doesn't apply to the god.

**Temples:** If temples to this deity tend to be in a certain kind of place, or if they tend to serve a certain societal function, that information is listed here.

**Worshippers:** The kind of people who tend to worship this deity, aside from dedicated priests.

**Alternate Domains:** If the deity offers 1, they are listed here. If the deity does not offer alternate domains, this section is omitted.

### Other Deities
<sup>LOGM p. 11</sup>

Starting on page 52, this chapter also provides details on 20 additional deities who are important in their own right, including their statistics and the mechanical information required to play a champion, cleric, or other worshipper of that deity. Each god's stat block presents information useful for understanding that deity and lists the benefits worshippers receive from the [avatar](../../compendium/spells/avatar.md) spell. These statistics use the following format.

**Name:** The deity's name plus a common title or epithet.

**Areas of Concern:** The topics that the deity cares most deeply about.

**Alignment:** The deity's alignment. In parentheses, the entry lists other character alignments that this deity accepts from worshippers. For instance, [Kazutal](../../compendium/setting/deities/kazutal-logm.md), the goddess of protection and community, accepts any good-aligned clerics. [Arazni](../../compendium/setting/deities/arazni-logm.md), who is embittered and prone to cruelty, nonetheless has some sympathy for victims of abuse and accepts evil, neutral, and good worshippers, since she is less concerned about her worshippers' morality.

**Divine Font:** This entry presents whether the deity grants worshippers [heal](../../compendium/spells/heal.md) or [harm](../../compendium/spells/harm.md), or can grant both. [Heal](../../compendium/spells/heal.md) heals the living and harms undead, while [harm](../../compendium/spells/harm.md) harms the living and heals undead. Usually, good deities channel [heal](../../compendium/spells/heal.md), evil deities channel [harm](../../compendium/spells/harm.md), and neutral deities can channel [harm](../../compendium/spells/harm.md) or [heal](../../compendium/spells/heal.md), but there are exceptions.

**Divine Ability:** This section lists the two ability boosts the deity grants as options for characters with the [raised by belief](../../compendium/character/backgrounds/raised-by-belief-logm.md) background.

**Divine Skill:** This section lists a skill that is especially associated with this deity, which their followers would naturally be good at due to their worship or association with this deity.

**Domains:** The domains that best represent this deity.

**Alternate Domains:** If the deity offers 1, they are listed here. If the deity doesn't offer alternate domains, this section is omitted.

**Cleric Spells:** Each deity provides at least three additional spells to the spell list of clerics who worship them. Typically these are a 1st-level spell and two other thematically appropriate spells.

**Edicts:** These are things that the deity urges their followers to do. Followers must adhere to these as closely as possible if they wish to gain favor with this deity.

**Anathema:** These are things that are absolutely abhorrent to the deity; committing these acts will likely earn a follower disfavor or punishment.

**Favored Weapon:** The deity's 1.
