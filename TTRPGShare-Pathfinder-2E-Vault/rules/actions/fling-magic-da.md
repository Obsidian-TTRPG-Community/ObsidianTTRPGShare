- **Requirements**: You are holding your First Implement and Esoterica|Thaumaturge|DA|wand|DA|1||wand implement.
- **Activity**: Two-Action

You fling magical energy at a target within 60 feet, dealing damage equal to `1d4` + your Charisma modifier to the target, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The damage is of the type you selected when you gained your First Implement and Esoterica|Thaumaturge|DA|wand|DA|1||wand implement. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.

You can expend more energy than usual to boost the effect of Fling Magic, dealing d6s of damage instead of `d4`s. After you do so, the wand takes `1d4` rounds to recharge, during which you can't boost the wand's damage but can continue to Fling Magic normally. If you critically hit with a [Strike](strike.md), your wand recharges immediately as it draws in power from the clash.
