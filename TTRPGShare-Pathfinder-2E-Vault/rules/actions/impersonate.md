**Skill** [deception](../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) (untrained)

You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a [disguise kit](../../compendium/equipment/items/disguise-kit.md), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you're not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM's discretion.

In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if they use the [Seek](seek.md) action to attempt [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks against your [Deception](../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a secret [Deception](../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) check for you against that creature's [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC instead. If you're disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you're imitating, or the GM might roll a secret [Deception](../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) check even if you aren't directly interacting with others.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You trick the creature into thinking you're the person you're disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behavior changes.
> - **Failure** The creature can tell you're not who you claim to be.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature can tell you're not who you claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.
