# Create Forgery (basic)
[downtime](../traits/downtime.md)  [secret](../traits/secret.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 251*  

**Skill** [society](../../compendium/skills.md#Society) (trained)

You create a forged document, usually over the course of a day or a week. You must have the proper writing material to create a forgery. When you Create a Forgery, the GM rolls a secret DC 20 [Society](../../compendium/skills.md#Society) check. If you succeed, the forgery is of good enough quality that passive observers can't notice the fake. Only those who carefully examine the document and attempt a [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) or [Society](../../compendium/skills.md#Society) check against your [Society](../../compendium/skills.md#Society) DC can do so.

If the document's handwriting doesn't need to be specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to your check, as well as to your DC (the GM determines the bonus). To forge a specific person's handwriting, you need a sample of that person's handwriting.

If your check result was below 20, the forgery has some obvious signs of being a fake, so the GM compares your result to each passive observer's [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC or Society DC, whichever is higher, using the success or failure results below. Once the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result is used against all passive observers' DCs no matter how many creatures passively observe that document.

An observer who was fooled on a passive glance can still choose to closely scrutinize the documents on the lookout for a forgery, using different techniques and analysis methods beyond the surface elements you successfully forged with your original check. In that case, the observer can attempt a [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) or [Society](../../compendium/skills.md#Society) check against your [Society](../../compendium/skills.md#Society) DC (if they succeed, they know your document is a forgery).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The observer does not detect the forgery.
> - **Failure** The observer knows your document is a forgery.
