**Variant Rule** Stamina
- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), [Intimidation](../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), [Performance](../../compendium/skills.md#Performance)

You spend 1 minute encouraging your ally. Though this action typically has the auditory and linguistic traits, if you're using the [Performance](../../compendium/skills.md#Performance) skill, the GM might adjust the traits for this action to match the traits for your type of performance.

Attempt a DC 15 skill check. The GM might adjust this DC based on the circumstances, such as attempting to Rally an ally who just suffered a humiliating defeat.
