*Source: Core Rulebook p. 244*  

**Skill** [crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (trained)

You can make an item from raw materials. You need the [Alchemical Crafting](../../compendium/feats/alchemical-crafting.md) skill feat to create alchemical items, the [Magical Crafting](../../compendium/feats/magical-crafting.md) skill feat to create magic items, and the [Snare Crafting](../../compendium/feats/snare-crafting.md) feat to create snares.

To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:

- The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting), and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary.
- You have the formula for the item; see Getting Formulas below for more information.
- You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield.
- You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item's Price. You always expend at least that amount of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you're in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials.

You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check. The GM determines the DC to Craft the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances.

If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the raw materials you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item's Price in materials to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the value of the materials you need to expend to complete the item. This amount is determined using [Table 4–2: Income Earned](../tables/income-earned.md), based on your proficiency rank in [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in materials. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off. An example of [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) appears in the sidebar.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting).
> - **Success** Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank.
> - **Failure** You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try again, you must start over.
> - **Critical Failure** You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of the raw materials you supplied, but you can salvage the rest. If you want to try again, you must start over.

> [!pf2-example] Consumables and Ammunition
> 
> You can Craft items with the [consumable](../traits/consumable.md) trait in batches, making up to four of the same item at once with a single check. This requires you to include the raw materials for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must complete the batch all at once. You also [Craft](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/craft.md) non-magical ammunition in batches, using the quantity listed in [Table 6–8: Ranged Weapons](../tables/ranged-weapons.md) (typically 10).

> [!pf2-example] Getting Formulas
> 
> You can gain access to the formulas for all common items in Chapter 6: Equipment by purchasing a [basic crafter's book](../../compendium/equipment/items/basic-crafters-book.md). See the rules on page 293 for information on how to acquire other formulas.

> [!pf2-brown] Crafting Example
> 
> Ezren is a 5th-level wizard and an expert in [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting). He has a [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) modifier of +13 and the [Magical Crafting](../../compendium/feats/magical-crafting.md) feat. With 2 weeks of downtime ahead of him, he decides to craft a [striking](../../compendium/equipment/items/striking.md) rune, a 4th-level item. The GM secretly chooses a DC of 19.
> 
> The item has a Price of 65 gp, so Ezren prepares 32 gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials. He has another 32 gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials on hand. After spending 4 days building and incanting spells, he rolls a 12 on his [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check, for a result of 25. That's a success! At this point, Ezren can spend the additional 32 gp, 5 sp worth of materials to complete the item immediately for 65 gp.
> 
> However, Ezren has 10 more days on his hands, so he decides to spend additional time to complete the item.
> 
> Because he's a 5th-level character and an expert at [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting), he reduces the amount he has to pay by 1 gp for each day spent. After spending 10 days working, he reduces the cost to complete the item from 65 gp to 55 gp. He spends the remaining portion of its Price in materials, completes the [striking](../../compendium/equipment/items/striking.md) rune, and goes out on his next adventure. (He could have stayed home to keep working on the striking rune, eventually reducing the item's total Price to just the half he paid up front, but adventuring is far more lucrative!) If Ezren's [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check result were a 29 or higher, he'd have gotten a critical success. In that case, he'd reduce the remaining amount by 2 gp per day, lowering the amount needed to complete the item after 10 additional days of work to 45 gp.
