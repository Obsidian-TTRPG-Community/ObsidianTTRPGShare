- **Requirements**: Legendary in [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You use legendary Vudran techniques to craft a disharmonic instrument that incorporates pieces of Kothogaz's heart. This is likely a tanpura, but legends mention other instruments and even voice enhancers. A disharmonic instrument is a virtuoso musical instrument.

This activity requires seven [disharmonic heartslivers](harvest-heartsliver-lomm.md), the formula for a disharmonic instrument, 55,000 gp worth of rare materials, and 7 days of work. At the end of the 7 days, attempt a DC 40 Crafting check to [Craft](craft.md).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You masterfully complete the disharmonic instrument. Holding the instrument grants immunity to Kothogaz's tympanic heartbeat and many-eyed blight.
> - **Success** You complete the disharmonic instrument.
> - **Failure** You don't complete the disharmonic instrument, and you contract many-eyed blight from the heartslivers.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever you're on the same plane as Kothogaz, it can immediately teleport to you with its Disharmonic Door ability.
