# Invest an Item (basic) [V](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies")
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 531*  


- **Activity**: Varies

You invest your energy in an item with the [invested](../traits/invested.md) trait as you don it. This process requires 1 or more Interact actions, usually taking the same amount of time it takes to don the item. Once you've Invested the Item, you benefit from its constant magical abilities as long as you meet its other requirements (for most invested items, the only other requirement is that you must be wearing the item). This investiture lasts until you remove the item.

You can invest no more than 10 items per day. If you remove an invested item, it loses its investiture. The item still counts against your daily limit after it loses its investiture. You reset the limit during your daily preparations, at which point you Invest your Items anew. If you're still wearing items you had invested the previous day, you can typically keep them invested on the new day, but they still count against your limit.
