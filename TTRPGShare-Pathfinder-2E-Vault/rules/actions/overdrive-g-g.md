**Class** inventor
- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Activity**: Single Action

Temporarily cranking the gizmos on your body into overdrive, you try to add greater power to your attacks. Attempt a [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check that has a [standard DC for your level](../tables/dcs-by-level.md).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your gizmos go into a state of incredible efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to your attacks. Your [Strikes](strike.md) deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or reset, and you can't use Overdrive for 1 minute.
> - **Success** Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is equal to half your Intelligence modifier.
> - **Failure** You make a miscalculation and nothing happens.
> - **Critical Failure** Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire damage equal to your level, and you can't use Overdrive again for 1 minute as your gizmos cool down and reset.
