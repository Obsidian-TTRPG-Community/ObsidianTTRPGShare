# Cover Tracks (basic)
[concentrate](../traits/concentrate.md)  [exploration](../traits/exploration.md)  [move](../traits/move.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 252*  

**Skill** [survival](../../compendium/skills.md#Survival) (trained)

You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed. You don't need to attempt a [Survival](../../compendium/skills.md#Survival) check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a [Survival](../../compendium/skills.md#Survival) check against your [Survival](../../compendium/skills.md#Survival) DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.

In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn't have the [exploration](../traits/exploration.md) trait.
