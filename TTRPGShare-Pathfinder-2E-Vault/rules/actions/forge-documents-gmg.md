**Variant Rule** Infiltration

You prepare forgeries that might serve as convincing props. Attempt a hard or very hard [Society](../../compendium/skills.md#Society) check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You create convincing forgeries and gain 1 EP you can use only when presenting some form of paperwork.
> - **Failure** You create unconvincing documents. You gain 1 EP that (unknown to you) grants no benefit when used.
> - **Critical Failure** As a failure, but a PC who tries to use the Edge Point gets a critical failure, even if they use the Edge Point after rolling a failure.
