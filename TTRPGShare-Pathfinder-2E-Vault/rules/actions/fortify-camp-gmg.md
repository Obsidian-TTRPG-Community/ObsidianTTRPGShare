# Fortify Camp
*Source: Gamemastery Guide p. 173*  

**Variant Rule** Hexploration

You can spend time fortifying your camp for defense with a successful [Crafting](../../compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check (typically at a trained or expert DC). Anyone keeping watch or defending the camp gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls and [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](seek.md) creatures attempting to sneak up on the camp.
