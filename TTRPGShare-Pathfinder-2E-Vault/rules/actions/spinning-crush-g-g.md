**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Vanguard
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or loaded crossbow.
- **Activity**: Three-Action

You go into a vicious spin, smashing your weapon into those nearby and increasing your momentum by firing. All creatures adjacent to you take `1d6` bludgeoning damage plus your Strength modifier; this increases to `2d6` if your firearm has a [striking](../../compendium/equipment/items/striking.md) rune, `3d6` if it has a greater striking rune, and `4d6` if it has a major striking rune. This ability does not apply other effects that increase damage with your firearm [Strikes](strike.md) such as weapon specialization. Creatures affected by this attack must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save is also pushed 5 feet directly away from you.
