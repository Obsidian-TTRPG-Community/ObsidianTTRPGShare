*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 116*  

**Class** champion; **Subclass** Desecrator
- **Trigger** An enemy within 15 feet damages you.
- **Activity**: Reaction

Your self-interest keeps you safe. You gain resistance against the triggering damage equal to 2 + half your level, regardless of damage type.

In addition, your [Strikes](strike.md) against the triggering creature deal 1 extra damage until the end of your next turn. You choose whether this extra damage is evil or negative each time you use this reaction. This extra damage increases to 2 at 9th level and 3 at 16th level.
