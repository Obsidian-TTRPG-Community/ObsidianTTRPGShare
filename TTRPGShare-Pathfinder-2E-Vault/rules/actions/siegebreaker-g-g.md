**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Vanguard
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a firearm that has the kickback or scatter trait, or a two-handed crossbow.
- **Activity**: Three-Action

With unbelievable force, you charge and smash your weapon into a target before digging in your heels and pulling the trigger. [Leap](leap.md) or [Stride](stride.md), then make a [Strike](strike.md) with the required firearm or crossbow against an adjacent target. This Strike deals an additional `3d8` bludgeoning damage and ignores 10 points of the target's Hardness (if any), or of their shield's Hardness if the target uses [Shield Block](../../compendium/feats/shield-block.md).

After the [Strike](strike.md), you become [immobilized](../conditions.md#Immobilized) and position the required weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the chosen weapon has the [parry](../traits/parry.md) trait. Both effects last until the start of your next turn. If a force would move you while you're [immobilized](../conditions.md#Immobilized) in this way, it must succeed at an appropriate check against your class DC.
