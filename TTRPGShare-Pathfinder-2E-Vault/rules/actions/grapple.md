# Grapple (basic) [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[attack](../traits/attack.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 242*  

**Skill** [athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (untrained)
- **Requirements**: You have at least one free hand or have your target grappled or [restrained](../conditions.md#Restrained). Your target cannot be more than one size larger than you.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You attempt to grab an opponent with your free hand. Attempt an [Athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against their Fortitude DC. You can also Grapple to keep your hold on a creature you already grabbed or restrained.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your opponent is [restrained](../conditions.md#Restrained) until the end of your next turn unless you move or your opponent [Escapes](escape.md).
> - **Success** Your opponent is [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) until the end of your next turn unless you move or your opponent [Escapes](escape.md).
> - **Failure** You fail to grab your opponent. If you already had the opponent [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../conditions.md#Restrained) using a Grapple, those conditions on that creature end.
> - **Critical Failure** If you already had the opponent [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../conditions.md#Restrained), it breaks free. Your target can either grab you, as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you, or force you to fall and land [prone](../conditions.md#Prone).
