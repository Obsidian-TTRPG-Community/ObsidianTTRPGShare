*Source: Guns & Gears p. 108*  

**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Drifter
- **Requirements**: On your last action, you failed (but didn't critically fail) a Strike with a firearm or crossbow you're holding in one hand, and your other hand is either wielding a melee weapon or empty.
- **Activity**: Single Action

Your last attack failed, but it set you up for another. Make a [Strike](strike.md) with your other hand, using a one-handed melee weapon or unarmed attack. This [Strike](strike.md) uses the same multiple attack penalty as the [Strike](strike.md) that failed on the last action. Afterward, increase your multiple attack penalty normally.
