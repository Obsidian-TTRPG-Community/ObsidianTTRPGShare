# Avoid Notice (basic)
[exploration](../traits/exploration.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 479*  



You attempt a [Stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check to avoid notice while traveling at half speed. If you have the [Swift Sneak](../../compendium/feats/swift-sneak.md) feat, you can move at full Speed rather than half, but you still can't use another exploration activity while you do so. If you have the [Legendary Sneak](../../compendium/feats/legendary-sneak.md) feat, you can move at full Speed and use a second exploration activity. If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a [Stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check instead of a [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DCs, as normal for [Sneak](sneak.md), regardless of their initiative check results).
