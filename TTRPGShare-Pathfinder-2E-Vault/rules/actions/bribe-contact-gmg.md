# Bribe Contact
[downtime](../traits/downtime.md)  [secret](../traits/secret.md)  
*Source: Gamemastery Guide p. 163*  

**Variant Rule** Infiltration
- **Cost**: A bribe worth at least one-tenth of the Currency per Additional PC listed on [Table 10–9: Party Treasure by Level](../tables/party-treasure-by-level.md). Doubling this amount grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.
- **Requirements**: You've successfully [Gained a Contact](gain-contact-gmg.md)

You offer a bribe to your contact to help the heist in some way. Attempt a hard or very hard [Deception](../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 EP.
> - **Failure** You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained 1 EP, but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, adding 1 AP to the infiltration. The GM can reveal that this Edge Point grants no benefit at any point during the infiltration, as befits the story.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but adding 2 AP to the infiltration.
