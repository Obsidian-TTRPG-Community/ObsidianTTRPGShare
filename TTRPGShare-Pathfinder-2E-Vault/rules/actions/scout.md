# Scout (basic)
[concentrate](../traits/concentrate.md)  [exploration](../traits/exploration.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 480*  



You scout ahead and behind the group to watch danger, moving at half speed. At the start of the next encounter, every creature in your party gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls.
