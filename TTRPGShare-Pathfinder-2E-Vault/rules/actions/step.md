*Source: Core Rulebook p. 471*  


- **Requirements**: Your Speed is at least 10 feet.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You carefully move 5 feet. Unlike most types of movement, Stepping doesn't trigger reactions, such as Attacks of Opportunity, that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square.

You can't Step into difficult terrain, and you can't Step using a Speed other than your land Speed.
