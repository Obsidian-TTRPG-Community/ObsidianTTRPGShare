# Conceal an Object (basic) [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[manipulate](../traits/manipulate.md)  [secret](../traits/secret.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 251*  

**Skill** [stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Single Action

You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon of light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your [Stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check and compares it to this passive observer's [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC. Once the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same result is used no matter how many passive observers you try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for an item, it can attempt a [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against your [Stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DC (finding the object on success).

You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their [Perception](../../compendium/skills.md#Perception) check results to your [Stealth](../../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DC to determine whether they find the object.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The object remains [undetected](../conditions.md#Undetected).
> - **Failure** The searcher finds the object.
