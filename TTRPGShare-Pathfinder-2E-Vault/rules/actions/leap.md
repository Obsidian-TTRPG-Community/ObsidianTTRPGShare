# Leap (basic) [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 470*  


- **Activity**: Single Action

You take a careful, short jump. You can [Leap](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/leap.md) up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 30 feet. You land in the space where your [Leap](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/leap.md) ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap, or a 10-foot gap if your Speed is 30 feet or more).

If you [Leap](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/leap.md) vertically, you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally onto an elevated surface.

Jumping a greater distance requires using the [Athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill.
