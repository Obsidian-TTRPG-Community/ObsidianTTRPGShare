# Long Jump (basic) [>>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 242*  

**Skill** [athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Two-Action

You [Stride](stride.md), then make a horizontal [Leap](leap.md) and attempt an [Athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to increase the length of your jump. The DC of the [Athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check is equal to the total distance in feet you're attempting to move during your [Leap](leap.md) (so you'd need to succeed at a DC 20 check to [Leap](leap.md) 20 feet). You can't [Leap](leap.md) farther than your Speed.

If you didn't [Stride](stride.md) at least 10 feet, or if you attempt to jump in a different direction than your [Stride](stride.md), you automatically fail your check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation, as determined by the GM.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** Increase the maximum horizontal distance you [Leap](leap.md) to the desired distance.
> - **Failure** You [Leap](leap.md) normally.
> - **Critical Failure** You [Leap](leap.md) normally, but then fall and land [prone](../conditions.md#Prone).
