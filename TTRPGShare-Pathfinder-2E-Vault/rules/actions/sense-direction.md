# Sense Direction (basic)
[exploration](../traits/exploration.md)  [secret](../traits/secret.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 252*  

**Skill** [survival](../../compendium/skills.md#Survival) (untrained)

Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a [Survival](../../compendium/skills.md#Survival) check only once per day, but some environments or changes might necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so). More unusual locales or those you're unfamiliar with might require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense Direction. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to checks to Sense Direction.

> - **Success** You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you have a sense of those directions.
