# Hero Point Deck  
*Source: Hero Point Deck p. 0*  

| `d52` | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Ancestral Might:** _Play during your turn._ Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 status bonus to checks based on the ability scores that are boosted by your ancestry (ignoring free boosts). If your ancestry only grants free boosts, select one ability score to gain the bonus to instead. |
| 2 | **Aura of Protection:** _Play this after [Casting a Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md) from your spell slots._ You surround yourself with an aura of residual magic power. Until the start of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage equal to the level of the spell that you just cast. |
| 3 | **Battle Cry:** _Play after making a successful melee attack._ You unleash a terrifying battle cry. Attempt an [Intimidation](../../compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](../actions/demoralize.md) and compare the result against all enemies within 30 feet. |
| 4 | **Called Foe:** _Play before you make a [Strike](../actions/strike.md)._ Designate a foe that you can see. You gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls made against that foe, but you take a -4 status penalty to attack rolls made against any other creature. This lasts until the end of your next turn or until you critically hit the designated foe, whichever comes first. |
| 5 | **Catch your Breath:** _Play at the end of your turn._ Select yourself or an ally within 30 feet. The creature you choose must have fewer than half their total Hit Points. The creature gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to twice your level, which last until the end of the combat. |
| 6 | **Channel Life Force:** _Play on your turn after you have spent all of your Focus Points._ Gain 1 Focus Point that must be spent by the end of your turn or it's lost. If you use this Focus Point, you become [drained](../conditions.md#Drained). |
| 7 | **Class Might:** _Play during your turn._ Until the start of your next turn you gain a +2 status bonus to checks based on the key ability score of your class. If your class grants a choice for its key ability, select one of those ability scores to gain the bonus. |
| 8 | **Critical Moment:** _Play this after rolling a check._ Reroll the check twice and take the best result. This is a [fortune](../traits/fortune.md) effect. If you still fail this check, you become [doomed](../conditions.md#Doomed). |
| 9 | **Cut Through the Fog:** _Play before you attempt a Will save._ You succeed at the saving throw without needing to roll. You gain the [stupefied](../conditions.md#Stupefied) condition, which lasts until the next time you get a full night's rest. |
| 10 | **Daring Attempt:** _Play at the start of your turn._ Select one untrained skill. You are trained in that skill until the end of your next turn. If you use that skill before the end of your next turn and succeed at your skill check, you keep this benefit until the end of the combat, or for 1 minute if not in combat. |
| 11 | **Desperate Swing:** _Play during your turn._ Make a [Strike](../actions/strike.md), ignoring the multiple attack penalty. If you roll a critical success, you get a normal success instead. If the attack fails, you [release](../actions/release.md) your weapon, or drop [prone](../conditions.md#Prone) if you were using an unarmed attack or otherwise can't [release](../actions/release.md) your weapon. |
| 12 | **Distract Foe:** _Play this when a foe within 30 feet makes a melee attack against another creature._ That foe is [fascinated](../conditions.md#Fascinated) with you and it can't end this condition until it takes a hostile action against you or the combat ends. |
| 13 | **Dive Out of Danger:** _Play before you attempt a Reflex save._ You succeed at the saving throw without needing to roll. You gain the [clumsy](../conditions.md#Clumsy) condition, which lasts until the next time you get a full night's rest. |
| 14 | **Drain Power:** _Play when you [Activate a magic item](../actions/activate-an-item.md) that [Casts a Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md)._ Heighten the spell by 1 level. This can't heighten the item's spell above half your level, rounded up. If the item wasn't consumed on use, you can't use the item again for 24 hours. |
| 15 | **Endure the Onslaught:** _Play at any time._ Give a creature you can see resistance 5 to all damage until the start of your next turn. If you are 7th level or higher, the resistance is 10, and if you are 12th level or higher, the resistance is 15. |
| 16 | **Flash of Insight:** _Play at the start of your turn._ Until the end of your turn, you gain [Automatic Knowledge](../../compendium/feats/automatic-knowledge.md) for any one skill. If you already have [Automatic Knowledge](../../compendium/feats/automatic-knowledge.md), when you use that feat to attempt a [Recall Knowledge](../actions/recall-knowledge.md) check this turn, use an outcome one degree of success better than the result of your roll. If you use this to learn about a creature, you gain twice the number of clues about its abilities. |
| 17 | **Fluid Motion:** _Play at the start of your turn._ For the rest of your turn, you gain a climb Speed and a swim Speed equal to half your Speed. If you make a horizontal [Leap](../actions/leap.md), increase the distance jumped by 10 feet. |
| 18 | **Grazing Blow:** _Play after a foe hit you with a [Strike](../actions/strike.md)._ If the foe rolled a critical success, it gets a success instead. If the foe rolled a success, it deals minimum damage instead of rolling for damage. |
| 19 | **Hasty Block:** _Play when you are hit by a physical attack, and you have a shield within reach and a free hand._ You [Interact](../actions/interact.md) to draw and wield the shield and then use it to [Shield Block](../abilities/shield-block.md) against the attack. After the attack and block are resolved, the shield is torn from your grip and lands in an adjacent space. |
| 20 | **Healing Prayer:** _Play during your turn._ Select yourself or an ally within reach. The target regains `1d8+8` Hit Points. If you are 7th level or higher, the target regains `2d8+16 ` Hit Points. If you are 12th level or higher, the target regains `3d8+24` Hit Points. |
| 21 | **Hold the Line:** _Play during your turn._ Until the start of your next turn, each time an enemy would leave a space adjacent to you while using a [move](../traits/move.md) action, it must succeed at an [Acrobatics](../../compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against your Fortitude DC or the move action is disrupted. |
| 22 | **I Hope This Works:** _Play at the start of your turn._ Once during your turn, you can [Activate an item](../actions/activate-an-item.md) to [Cast a Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md), even if you can't normally cast spells or don't have that spell on your spell list. After casting this spell, your turn ends. |
| 23 | **Impossible Shot:** _Play when making a ranged attack, either with a [Strike](../actions/strike.md) or a spell._ If you're attempting a [Strike](../actions/strike.md), double the range increment of the weapon or unarmed attack. If you're [Casting a Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md), increase the range of the spell by half. |
| 24 | **Last Ounce of Strength:** _Play at the start of a turn when you are [dying](../conditions.md#Dying)._ You regain consciousness and can act normally on your turn, but you can't regain Hit Points or remove the [dying](../conditions.md#Dying) condition during this turn. At the end of your turn, you fall [unconscious](../conditions.md#Unconscious) and your [dying](../conditions.md#Dying) condition increases by 1. Do not attempt a recovery check this turn. |
| 25 | **Last Second Sidestep:** _Play when you are targeted by a ranged [Strike](../actions/strike.md)._ The [Strike](../actions/strike.md) automatically misses. |
| 26 | **Last Stand:** _Play when you take damage._ Until the start of your next turn, any damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points leaves you with 1 Hit Point remaining and gives you the [doomed](../conditions.md#Doomed) condition, or increases your [doomed](../conditions.md#Doomed) value by 1 if you're already [doomed](../conditions.md#Doomed). As usual, you die when your [doomed](../conditions.md#Doomed) condition equals the dying value that would kill you (usually [doomed](../conditions.md#Doomed)). |
| 27 | **Magical Reverberation:** _Play this after [Casting a Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md)._ The spell's power reverberates in your mind. You can [Cast this Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md) one additional time without having it prepared or expending a spell slot. If you don't [Cast the Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md) by the end of your next turn, it is lost. After [Casting the Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md) again, you become [stupefied](../conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute. |
| 28 | **Make Way!:** _Play at the start of a [Stride](../actions/stride.md)._ During the [Stride](../actions/stride.md), you must move in a straight line, but you can attempt to [Shove](../actions/shove.md) any creature in your way, moving it to an adjacent space out of the way of your movement. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to any of these free [Shove](../actions/shove.md) attempts, nor do they increase your multiple attack penalty. If you fail to [Shove](../actions/shove.md) a creature out of your way, your movement ends. |
| 29 | **Misdirected Attack:** _Play after a foe critically fails on a melee [Strike](../actions/strike.md) against you._ That foe rerolls the attack, targeting one of its allies within reach. |
| 30 | **Opportune Distraction:** _Play at the start of your turn._ Until the end of your turn, you gain the benefits of greater cover after taking the [Hide](../actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../actions/sneak.md) action, allowing you to [Hide](../actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../actions/sneak.md) in the open. This effect ends if you do anything other than [Hide](../actions/hide.md), [Sneak](../actions/sneak.md), or [Step](../actions/step.md). |
| 31 | **Pierce Resistance:** _Play after you learn about a foe's resistance._ Until the end of your next turn, the foe loses a resistance of your choice. You must be aware of the resistance, either from seeing it shrug off damage from an attack or due to a successful [Recall Knowledge](../actions/recall-knowledge.md) check. |
| 32 | **Press On:** _Play at the start of your turn._ Until the end of your turn, ignore penalties to checks and DCs from conditions. |
| 33 | **Protect the Innocent:** _Play when an incapacitated ally or noncombatant NPC within sight takes damage from an attack or effect._ Prevent all of the damage. You take half of the damage they would have taken (in addition to the damage you would normally take from the attack or effect, if any). You can only use this to prevent damage to an ally if that ally is unable to act, such as when they are [unconscious](../conditions.md#Unconscious) or [paralyzed](../conditions.md#Paralyzed). |
| 34 | **Push Through the Pain:** _Play before you attempt a Fortitude save._ You succeed at the saving throw without needing to roll. You gain the [drained](../conditions.md#Drained) condition. |
| 35 | **Rage and Fury:** _Play when an ally is knocked [unconscious](../conditions.md#Unconscious) or when you take damage from a critical hit._ At the start of your next turn, you enter a rage (+2 damage to melee [strikes](../actions/strike.md), -1 AC penalty, no [concentrate](../traits/concentrate.md) actions unless they have the [rage](../traits/rage.md) trait, or use the stats for your rage|barbarian||1 class feature if you have one). At the end of that turn, if you don't have the rage|barbarian||1 class feature, the rage ends and you are [fatigued](../conditions.md#Fatigued). |
| 36 | **Rampage:** _Play at the start of your turn._ Make a [Strike](../actions/strike.md) against each foe within reach. The multiple attack penalty applies as normal. At the end of these attacks, your turn ends and you are [fatigued](../conditions.md#Fatigued). |
| 37 | **Reckless Charge:** _Play after taking two consecutive [Stride](../actions/stride.md) actions._ Make a melee [Strike](../actions/strike.md). You are [flat-footed](../conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn. |
| 38 | **Rending Swipe:** _Play after making two successful consecutive melee [Strikes](../actions/strike.md) against the same target with two different weapons._ The target takes `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](../conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [sickened](../conditions.md#Sickened) until the bleeding stops. If you are 7th level or higher, increase the bleed to `2d6`. If you are 12th level or higher, increase the bleed to `3d6`. |
| 39 | **Reverse Strike:** _Play after you fail an attack roll._ You get a success on the attack roll rather than a failure. |
| 40 | **Roll Back:** _Play after an attack or effect causes you to become [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) or knocks you [prone](../conditions.md#Prone)._ You roll backward from the attack, landing on your feet. Take a [Step](../actions/step.md) away from the source of the attack (if any), and you're no longer [prone](../conditions.md#Prone) or [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed). |
| 41 | **Run and Shoot:** _Play when you take a [Stride](../actions/stride.md) action._ You make a ranged [Strike](../actions/strike.md) at any point during this movement. |
| 42 | **Shake it Off:** _Play at any time._ All [persistent damage](../conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) affecting you immediately comes to an end. |
| 43 | **Shoot Through:** _Play when you are about to make your attack roll for a ranged [Strike](../actions/strike.md)._ If the path of the [Strike](../actions/strike.md) goes through another creature's space before reaching the target, the target is [flat-footed](../conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the attack, and the other creature doesn't provide cover. |
| 44 | **Spark of Courage:** _Play when you have the [frightened](../conditions.md#Frightened) condition._ You lose that condition and instead gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks until the end of your next turn. |
| 45 | **Stay in the Fight:** _Play at the start of a turn when you or an ally is affected by an ongoing [incapacitation](../traits/incapacitation.md) effect._ The creature ignores that [incapacitation](../traits/incapacitation.md) effect until the end of their turn. This turn doesn't count as part of the duration for that effect. |
| 46 | **Stoke the Magical Flame:** _Play when you or an ally is [Casting a Spell](../actions/cast-a-spell.md)._ Heighten that spell by 1 level. This can't heighten a spell above the highest level of spell you or the ally can cast. |
| 47 | **Strike True:** _Play when you or an ally are about to make a [Strike](../actions/strike.md)._ The target rolls twice and takes the higher result. This strike deals an extra die of damage on a hit if the attacker has fewer than half their maximum Hit Points, or two extra dice if they have fewer than one quarter their maximum Hit Points. This is a [fortune](../traits/fortune.md) effect. |
| 48 | **Surge of Magic:** _Play during your turn._ Until the end of your turn, you can [Activate one magic item](../actions/activate-an-item.md) that you have already activated once today. This activation doesn't count against the item's frequency limit if the limit is once per day, or a shorter increment of time. If the item is a [wand](../traits/wand.md), activating it this way doesn't overcharge it. |
| 49 | **Surge of Speed:** _Play at the start of a creature's turn._ That creature is [quickened](../conditions.md#Quickened) on its turn and can use the extra action only to take a single action with the [move](../traits/move.md) trait. |
| 50 | **Tuck and Roll:** _Play after a creature or hazard hits you with a [Strike](../actions/strike.md)._ You take the minimum amount of damage and fall [prone](../conditions.md#Prone). |
| 51 | **Tumble Through:** _Play after you end your movement adjacent to a creature that is larger than you._ Move to the opposite side of that creature. This movement doesn't trigger any reactions based on movement. |
| 52 | **Warding Sign:** _Play at any time._ Select a creature within sight. That creature is immune to [misfortune](../traits/misfortune.md) effects for 1 round. If the creature was already affected by a [misfortune](../traits/misfortune.md) effect, it ignores that effect for the duration, then the effect returns. |
