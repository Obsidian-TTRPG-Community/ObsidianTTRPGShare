### Regional Languages
<sup>CRB p. 432</sup>

These languages are uncommon outside the region of their genesis. A character hailing from one of the regions listed below automatically has access to that language. In the Inner Sea region, the language referred to as Common elsewhere in the rules is the same as Taldane—a result of Taldor's legacy of control and influence over the whole region.

Nearly every language listed here is spoken on the melting-pot streets of Absalom.

The factions summarized below represent a sampling of those active in the Inner Sea region.

## Religion
<sup>CRB p. 437</sup>

### Deities
<sup>CRB p. 437</sup>

Anyone can worship a deity, but those who do so devoutly should take care to pursue the faith's edicts (behaviors the faith encourages) and avoid its anathemas (actions considered blasphemous). Each deity below has their alignment listed in parentheses after their name, followed by a short description and their edicts, anathemas, and the alignments permitted for followers. Following that are benefits available to the most ardent devotees of the deities.

You get these benefits only if you're a cleric of the deity or some other rule specifically gives you a devotee benefit.

### Faiths and Philosophies
<sup>CRB p. 440</sup>

Of course, faith can express itself in more ways than venerating a single deity—or a deity at all. A few examples of nondeific religions and philosophies are presented below. Clerics can work with allied faiths and philosophies, but the organizations here turn to other classes—such as sorcerers with divine bloodlines, druids, or monks—to serve as their leaders. These faiths and philosophies don't have an external godhead that offers benefits to devotees.

### Domains
<sup>CRB p. 441</sup>

The following domains are used by the primary deities of Golarion, as listed on pages 437–440.
