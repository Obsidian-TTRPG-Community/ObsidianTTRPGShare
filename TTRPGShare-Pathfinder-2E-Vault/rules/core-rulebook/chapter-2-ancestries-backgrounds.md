# Chapter 2: Ancestries & Backgrounds
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

A character has one ancestry and one background, both of which you select during character creation. You'll also select a number of languages for your character. Once chosen, your ancestry and background can't be changed.

This chapter is divided into three parts:

- **Ancestries** express the culture your character hails from. Within many ancestries are heritages—subgroups that each have their own characteristics. An ancestry provides ability boosts (and perhaps ability flaws), Hit Points, ancestry feats, and sometimes additional abilities.
- **Backgrounds**, starting on page 60, describe training or environments your character experienced before becoming an adventurer. Your character's background provides ability boosts, skill training, and a skill feat.
- **Languages**, starting on page 65, let your character communicate with the wonderful and weird people and creatures of the world.

## Ancestry Entries
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

Each entry includes details about the ancestry and presents the rules elements described below (all of these but heritages and ancestry feats are listed in a sidebar).

### Hit Points
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

This tells you how many Hit Points your character gains from their ancestry at 1st level. You'll add the Hit Points from your character's class (including their Constitution modifier) to this number. For more on calculating Hit Points, see Step 7: Record Class Details, on page 25.

### Size
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

This tells you the physical size of members of the ancestry.

Medium corresponds roughly to the height and weight range of a human adult, and Small is roughly half that.

### Speed
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

This entry lists how far a member of the ancestry can move each time they spend an action (such as Stride) to do so.

### Ability Boosts
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

This lists the ability scores you apply ability boosts to when creating a character of this ancestry. Most ancestries provide ability boosts to two specified ability scores, plus a free ability boost that you can apply to any other score of your choice. For more about ability boosts, see page 20.

### Ability Flaw
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

This lists the ability score to which you apply an ability flaw when creating a character of this ancestry. Most ancestries, with the exception of humans, include an ability flaw. For more about applying ability flaws, see page 20.

### Languages
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

This tells you the languages that members of the ancestry speak at 1st level. If your Intelligence modifier is +1 or higher, you can select more languages from a list given here. More about languages can be found on page 65.

### Traits
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

These descriptors have no mechanical benefit, but they're important for determining how certain spells, effects, and other aspects of the game interact with your character.

### Special Abilities
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

Any other entries in the sidebar represent abilities, senses, and other qualities all members of the ancestry manifest.

These are omitted for ancestries with no special rules.

### Heritages
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

### Ancestry Feats
<sup>CRB p. 32</sup>

This section presents ancestry feats, which allow you to customize your character. You gain your first ancestry feat at 1st level, and you gain another at 5th level, 9th level, 13th level, and 17th level, as indicated in the class advancement table in the descriptions of each class.

Ancestry feats are organized by level. As a starting character, you can choose from only 1st-level ancestry feats, but later choices can be made from any feat of your level or lower. These feats also sometimes list prerequisites—requirements that your character must fulfill to select that feat.

## Dwarf
<sup>CRB p. 34</sup>

If you want to play a character who is as hard as nails, a stubborn and unrelenting adventurer, with a mix of rugged toughness and deep wisdom—or at least dogged conviction—you should play a dwarf.

## Elf
<sup>CRB p. 38</sup>

If you want a character who is magical, mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.

For the full entry on elves, click here.

## Gnome
<sup>CRB p. 42</sup>

If you want a character with boundless enthusiasm and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should play a gnome.

For the full entry on gnomes, click here.

## Goblin
<sup>CRB p. 46</sup>

If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic, and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.

For the full entry on goblins, click here.

## Halfling
<sup>CRB p. 50</sup>

If you want to play a character who must contend with these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort, you should play a halfling.

For the full entry on halflings, click here.

## Human
<sup>CRB p. 54</sup>

If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.

For the full entry on humans, click here.

## Backgrounds
<sup>CRB p. 60</sup>

At 1st level when you create your character, you gain a background of your choice. This decision is permanent; you can't change it at later levels. Each background listed here grants two ability boosts, a skill feat, and the trained proficiency rank in two skills, one of which is a Lore skill.

If you gain the trained proficiency rank in a skill from your background and would then gain the trained proficiency rank in the same skill from your class at 1st level, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice.

Lore skills represent deep knowledge of a specific subject and are described on page 247. If a Lore skill involves a choice (for instance, a choice of terrain), explain your preference to the GM, who has final say on whether it's acceptable or not. If you'd like some suggestions, the Common Lore Subcategories sidebar on page 248 lists a number of Lore skills that are suitable for most campaigns.

Skill feats expand the functions of your skills and appear here.

## Languages
<sup>CRB p. 65</sup>

Your ancestry entry states which languages you know at 1st level. Typically, this means you can both speak and read these languages. Having a positive Intelligence modifier grants a number of additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can choose these languages from the list presented in your character's ancestry entry and from those available from your region or ethnicity.

Ask your GM if there's a language you want to select that isn't on these lists. If your Intelligence changes later on, you adjust your number of languages accordingly.

The languages presented here are grouped according to how common they are throughout the Inner Sea region.

Languages that are common are regularly encountered in most places, even among those who aren't native speakers.

Languages that are uncommon (see [Table 2–2](../tables/uncommon-languages.md) and Regional Languages) are most frequently spoken by native speakers, but they are also spoken by certain scholars and others interested in the associated cultures.

Druidic is a secret language, and is available only to characters who are druids. In fact, druids are prohibited from teaching the language to non-druids (described further in Anathema on page 130).

It is possible for your character to learn languages later in their adventuring career. Selecting the Multilingual feat, for example, grants a character two new languages chosen from those listed in [Table 2–1: Common Languages](../tables/common-languages.md) and [Table 2–2: Uncommon Languages](../tables/uncommon-languages.md). Other abilities and effects might grant access to common or uncommon languages, as detailed in their descriptions.

![Common Languages](../tables/common-languages.md)

![Uncommon Languages](../tables/uncommon-languages.md)

![Secret Language](../tables/secret-language.md)

### Regional Languages
<sup>CRB p. 65</sup>

Regional languages depend on the game world you're playing in. Chapter 8: The Age of Lost Omens lists the regional languages of the Pathfinder world and where they're spoken (page 432). These languages are uncommon.

Most characters learn the Common language. This is the most widely used language in the region where the campaign takes place. In the Inner Sea region of Golarion, the Common tongue is Taldane, for example. Characters with Common might face a language barrier if they travel somewhere with a different Common language.

### Sign Language and Reading Lips
<sup>CRB p. 65</sup>

The language entry for most characters lists languages they use to communicate in spoken words. However, you might know the signed version of a language or know how to read lips. You can learn these by taking the Sign Language and Read Lips skill feats. If you are creating a character who is deaf, hard of hearing, or unable to speak, discuss with your GM whether it makes sense for your character to know sign languages or lip reading. If so, your GM might allow you to select one of these feats for free (even if you don't meet the prerequisites) to represent your character concept.
