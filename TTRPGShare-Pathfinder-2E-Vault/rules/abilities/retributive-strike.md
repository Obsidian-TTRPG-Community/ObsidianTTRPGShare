# Retributive Strike [R](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: An enemy damages the monster's ally, and both are within 15 feet of the monster.

**Effect** The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + the monster's level. If the foe is within reach, the monster makes a melee [Strike](../actions/strike.md) against it.
