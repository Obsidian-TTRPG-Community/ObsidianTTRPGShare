# Darkvision

A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level [darkness](../../compendium/spells/darkness.md) spell, block normal [darkvision](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/abilities/darkvision.md). A monster with greater darkvision, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.
