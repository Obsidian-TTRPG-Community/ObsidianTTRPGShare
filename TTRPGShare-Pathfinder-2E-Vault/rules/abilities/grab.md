# Grab [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Requirements**: The monster's last action was a success with a Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or it has a creature grabbed using this action.

**Effect** The monster automatically Grabs the target until the end of the monster's next turn. The creature is [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) by whichever body part the monster attacked with, and that body part can't be used to [Strike](../actions/strike.md) creatures until the grab is ended. Using Grab extends the duration of the monster's Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) by it. A [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) creature can use the [Escape](../actions/escape.md) action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) creatures if the monster moves away from it.
