# Collapse [R](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: The skeleton is critically hit.

**Effect** The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is [immobilized](../conditions.md#Immobilized) and [flat-footed](../conditions.md#Flat-footed).
