# Find Footing [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[concentrate](../traits/concentrate.md)  

The NPC attempts an [Architecture Lore](../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), [Engineering Lore](../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), or similar skill check to find a stable path across uneven ground. This grants them and anyone they share this information with a +2 circumstance bonus on [Acrobatics](../../compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Balance](../actions/balance.md) across that ground.
