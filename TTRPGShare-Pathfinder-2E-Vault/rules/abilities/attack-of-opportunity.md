# Attack of Opportunity [R](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

**Effect** The monster attempts a melee [Strike](../actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This [Strike](../actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](../actions/strike.md).
