# Push [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Requirements**: The monster's last action was a success with a Strike that lists Push in its damage entry.

**Effect** The monster automatically knocks the target away from the monster. Unless otherwise noted in the ability description, the creature is pushed 5 feet. If the attack was a critical hit, this distance is doubled.
