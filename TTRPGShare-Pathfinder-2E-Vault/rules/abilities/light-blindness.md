# Light Blindness

When first exposed to bright light, the monster is [blinded](../conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of its next turn. After this exposure, light doesn't blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in [darkness](../../compendium/spells/darkness.md). However, as long as the monster is in an area of bright light, it's [dazzled](../conditions.md#Dazzled).
