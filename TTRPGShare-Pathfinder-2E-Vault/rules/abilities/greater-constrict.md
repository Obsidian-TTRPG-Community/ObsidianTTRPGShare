# Greater Constrict [>](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures [grabbed](../conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](../conditions.md#Restrained) by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save falls [unconscious](../conditions.md#Unconscious), and a creature that succeeds is then temporarily immune to falling [unconscious](../conditions.md#Unconscious) from Greater Constrict for 1 minute.
