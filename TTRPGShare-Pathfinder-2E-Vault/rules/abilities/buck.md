# Buck [R](../core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature Mounts or uses the Command an Animal action while riding the monster.

**Effect** Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to buck off unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless the mounts are spooked or mistreated. The triggering creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the listed DC or fall off the creature and land [prone](../conditions.md#Prone). If the save is a critical failure, the triggering creature also takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage in addition to the normal damage for the fall.
