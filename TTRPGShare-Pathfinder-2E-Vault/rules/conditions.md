# Conditions  


## Blinded

You can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail [Perception](../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a –4 status penalty to [Perception](../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled).

## Broken

Broken is a condition that affects objects. An object is broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points below its Broken Threshold. A broken object can't be used for its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses—with the exception of armor. Broken armor still grants its item bonus to AC, but it also imparts a status penalty to AC depending on its category:–1 for broken light armor, –2 for broken medium armor, or –3 for broken heavy armor.

A broken item still imposes penalties and limitations normally incurred by carrying, holding, or wearing it. For example, broken armor would still impose its Dexterity modifier cap, check penalty, and so forth.

If an effect makes an item broken automatically and the item has more HP than its Broken Threshold, that effect also reduces the item's current HP to the Broken Threshold.

## Clumsy

Your movements become clumsy and inexact. Clumsy always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Dexterity-based checks and DCs, including AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and skill checks using [Acrobatics](../compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), [Stealth](../compendium/skills.md#Stealth), and [Thievery](../compendium/skills.md#Thievery).

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 618_

## Concealed

While you are concealed from a creature, such as in a thick fog, you are difficult for that creature to see. You can still be [observed](conditions.md#Observed), but you're tougher to target. A creature that you're concealed from must succeed at a DC 5 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check. If the check fails, the attack, spell, or effect doesn't affect you.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 618_

## Confused

You don't have your wits about you, and you attack wildly. You are [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed), you don't treat anyone as your ally (though they might still treat you as theirs), and you can't [Delay](actions/delay.md), [Ready](actions/ready.md), or use reactions.

You use all your actions to [Strike](actions/strike.md) or cast offensive cantrips, though the GM can have you use other actions to facilitate attack, such as draw a weapon, move so that a target is in reach, and so forth. Your targets are determined randomly by the GM. If you have no other viable targets, you target yourself, automatically hitting but not scoring a critical hit. If it's impossible for you to attack or cast spells, you babble incoherently, wasting your actions.

Each time you take damage from an attack or spell, you can attempt a DC 11 flat check to recover from your confusion and end the condition.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 618_

## Controlled

Someone else is making your decisions for you, usually because you're being commanded or magically dominated. The controller dictates how you act and can make you use any of your actions, including attacks, reactions, or even Delay. The controller usually does not have to spend their own actions when controlling you.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 618_

## Dazzled

Your eyes are overstimulated. If vision is your only precise sense, all creatures and objects are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) from you.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 619_

## Deafened

You can't hear. You automatically critically fail [Perception](../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks that require you to be able to hear. You take a –2 status penalty to [Perception](../compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks for initiative and checks that involve sound but also rely on other senses. If you perform an action with the [auditory](traits/auditory.md) trait, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost; attempt the check after spending the action but before any effects are applied. You are immune to [auditory](traits/auditory.md) effects.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 619_

## Doomed

A powerful force has gripped your soul, calling you closer to death. Doomed always includes a value. The dying value at which you die is reduced by your doomed value. If your maximum dying value is reduced to 0, you instantly die. When you die, you're no longer doomed.

Your doomed value decreases by 1 each time you get a full night's rest.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 619_

## Drained

When a creature successfully drains you of blood or life force, you become less healthy. Drained always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to your drained value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude saves. You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. For example, if you're hit by an effect that inflicts drained 3 and you're a 3rd-level character, you lose 9 Hit Points and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these Hit Points doesn't count as taking damage.

Each time you get a full night's rest, your drained value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don't immediately recover the lost Hit Points.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 619_

## Dying

You are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. While you have this condition, you are [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious). Dying always includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you're dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy's critical hit or a critical failure on your save.

If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious), but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded 1 condition, or increase your wounded condition value by 1 if you already have that condition.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 619_

## Encumbered

You are carrying more weight than you can manage. While you're encumbered, you're [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) and take a 10-foot penalty to all your Speeds. As with all penalties to your Speed, this can't reduce your Speed below 5 feet.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 619_

## Enfeebled

You're physically weakened. Enfeebled always includes a value. When you are enfeebled, you take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Strength-based rolls and DCs, including Strength-based melee attack rolls, Strength-based damage rolls, and [Athletics](../compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 619_

## Fascinated

You are compelled to focus your attention on something, distracting you from whatever else is going on around you. You take a –2 status penalty to [Perception](../compendium/skills.md#Perception) and skill checks, and you can't use actions with the [concentrate](traits/concentrate.md) unless they or their intended consequences are related to the subject of your fascination (as determined by the GM). For instance, you might be able to [Seek](actions/seek.md) and [Recall Knowledge](actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the subject, but you likely couldn't cast a spell targeting a different creature. This condition ends if a creature uses hostile actions against you or any of your allies.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 619_

## Fatigued

You're tired and can't summon much energy. You take a –1 status penalty to AC and saving throws. You can't use exploration activities performed while traveling.

You recover from fatigue after a full night's rest.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Flat-Footed

You're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others—especially conditions—can make you universally flatfooted against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed).

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Fleeing

You're forced to run away due to fear or some other compulsion. On your turn, you must spend each of your actions trying to escape the source of the fleeing condition as expediently as possible (such as by using [move](traits/move.md) actions to flee, or opening doors barring your escape). The source is usually the effect or caster that gave you the condition, though some effects might define something else as the source. You can't [Delay](actions/delay.md) or [Ready](actions/ready.md) while fleeing.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Friendly

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters. A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character. The character can attempt to make a [Request](actions/request.md) of a friendly creature, and the friendly creature is likely to agree to a simple and safe request that doesn't cost it much to fulfill. If the character or one of their allies uses hostile actions against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Frightened

You're gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves. The frightened condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to all your checks and DCs. Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases by 1.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Grabbed

You're held in place by another creature, giving you the [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) and [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized) conditions. If you attempt a [manipulate](traits/manipulate.md) action while grabbed, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Helpful

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters. A creature that is helpful to a character wishes to actively aid that character. It will accept reasonable Requests from that character, as long as such requests aren't at the expense of the helpful creature's goals or quality of life. If the character or one of their allies uses a hostile action against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Hidden

While you're hidden from a creature, that creature knows the space you're in but can't tell precisely where you are. You typically become hidden by using [Stealth](../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) to [Hide](actions/hide.md). When [Seeking](actions/seek.md) a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden), rather than [observed](conditions.md#Observed). A creature you're [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you, and it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails affect you. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.

A creature might be able to use the [Seek](actions/seek.md) action to try to observe you, as described on page 471.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Hostile

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters. A creature that is hostile to a character actively seeks to harm that character. It doesn't necessarily attack, but it won't accept Requests from the character.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Immobilized

You can't use any action with the [move](traits/move.md) trait. If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Indifferent

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters. A creature that is indifferent to a character doesn't really care one way or the other about that character. Assume a creature's attitude to a given character is indifferent unless specified otherwise.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Invisible

While invisible, you can't be seen. You're [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) to everyone. Creatures can [Seek](actions/seek.md) to attempt to detect you; if a creature succeeds at its [Perception](../compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against your [Stealth](../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DC, you become [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to that creature until you [Sneak](actions/sneak.md) to become [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) again. If you become invisible while someone can already see you, you start out [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to the observer (instead of [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected)) until you successfully [Sneak](actions/sneak.md). You can't become [observed](conditions.md#Observed) while invisible except via special abilities or magic.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 620_

## Observed

Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using [Stealth](../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) to [Hide](actions/hide.md), it can become [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) instead of observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When Seeking a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden), rather than observed.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 621_

## Paralyzed

Your body is frozen in place. You have the [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) condition and can't act except to [Recall Knowledge](actions/recall-knowledge.md) and use actions that require only the use of your mind (as determined by the GM). Your senses still function, but only in the areas you can perceive without moving your body, so you can't [Seek](actions/seek.md) while paralyzed.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 621_

## Persistent Damage

Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other situations. It appears as "X persistent [type] damage," where "X" is the amount of damage dealt and "[type]" is the damage type. Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice anew each time. After you take persistent damage, roll a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.

> [!pf2-brown] PERSISTENT DAMAGE RULES
> 
> The additional rules presented below apply to persistent damage in certain cases.
> 
> Persistent damage runs its course and automatically ends after a certain amount of time as fire burns out, blood clots, and the like. The GM determines when this occurs, but it usually takes 1 minute.
> 
> ### Assisted Recovery
> <sup>CRB p. 621</sup>
> 
> You can take steps to help yourself recover from persistent damage, or an ally can help you, allowing you to attempt an additional flat check before the end of your turn. This is usually an activity requiring 2 actions, and it must be something that would reasonably improve your chances (as determined by the GM). For example, you might try to smother a flame or wash off acid. This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round.
> 
> The GM decides how your help works, using the following examples as guidelines when there's not a specific action that applies.
> 
> - The action to help might require a skill check or another roll to determine its effectiveness.
> - Reduce the DC of the flat check to 10 for a particularly appropriate type of help, such as dousing you in water to put out flames.
> - Automatically end the condition due to the type of help, such as healing that restores you to your maximum HP to end persistent bleed damage, or submerging yourself in a lake to end persistent fire damage.
> - Alter the number of actions required to help you if the means the helper uses are especially efficient or remarkably inefficient.
> 
> ### Immunities, Resistances, and Weaknesses
> <sup>CRB p. 621</sup>
> 
> Immunities, resistances, and weaknesses all apply to persistent damage. If an effect deals initial damage in addition to persistent damage, apply immunities, resistances, and weaknesses separately to the initial damage and to the persistent damage. Usually, if an effect negates the initial damage, it also negates the persistent damage, such as with a slashing weapon that also deals persistent bleed damage because it cut you. The GM might rule otherwise in some situations.
> 
> ### Multiple Persistent Damage Conditions
> <sup>CRB p. 621</sup>
> 
> You can be simultaneously affected by multiple persistent damage conditions so long as they have different damage types. If you would gain more than one persistent damage condition with the same damage type, the higher amount of damage overrides the lower amount. The damage you take from persistent damage occurs all at once, so if something triggers when you take damage, it triggers only once; for example, if you're [dying](conditions.md#Dying) with several types of persistent damage, the persistent damage increases your [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition only once.

## Petrified

You have been turned to stone. You can't act, nor can you sense anything. You become an object with a Bulk double your normal Bulk (typically 12 for a petrified Medium creature or 6 for a petrified Small creature), AC 9, Hardness 8, and the same current Hit Points you had when alive. You don't have a Broken Threshold. When you're turned back into flesh, you have the same number of Hit Points you had as a statue. If the statue is destroyed, you immediately die. While petrified, your mind and body are in stasis, so you don't age or notice the passing of time.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 621_

## Prone

You're lying on the ground. You are [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) and take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only [move](traits/move.md) actions you can use while you're prone are [Crawl](actions/crawl.md) and [Stand](actions/stand.md). Standing up ends the prone condition. You can [Take Cover](actions/take-cover.md) while prone to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed)).

If you would be knocked prone while you're [Climbing](actions/climb.md) or [Flying](actions/fly.md), you fall (see pages 463–464 for the rules on falling). You can't be knocked prone when [Swimming](actions/swim.md).

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 621_

## Quickened

You gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round. Many effects that make you quickened specify the types of actions you can use with this additional action. If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can use the extra action you've been granted for any single action allowed by any of the effects that made you quickened. Because quickened has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately gain actions if you become quickened during your turn.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 622_

## Restrained

You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) and [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized) conditions, and you can't use any actions with the [attack](traits/attack.md) or [manipulate](traits/manipulate.md) traits except to attempt to [Escape](actions/escape.md) or [Force Open](actions/force-open.md) your bonds. [Restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) overrides grabbed.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 622_

## Sickened

You feel ill. Sickened always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value on all your checks and DCs. You can't willingly ingest anything—including elixirs and potions—while sickened.

You can spend a single action retching in an attempt to recover, which lets you immediately attempt a Fortitude save against the DC of the effect that made you sickened. On a success, you reduce your sickened value by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success).

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 622_

## Slowed

You have fewer actions. Slowed always includes a value. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by your slowed value. Because slowed has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately lose actions if you become slowed during your turn.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 622_

## Stunned

You've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.

Stunned overrides [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed). If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed), you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed). So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 622_

## Stupefied

Your thoughts and instincts are clouded. Stupefied always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks and DCs, including Will saving throws, spell attack rolls, spell DCs, and skill checks that use these ability scores. Any time you attempt to [Cast a Spell](actions/cast-a-spell.md) while stupefied, the spell is disrupted unless you succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + your stupefied value.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 622_

## Unconscious

You're sleeping, or you've been knocked out. You can't act. You take a –4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) and [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall prone and drop items you are wielding or holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM determines you're in a position in which you wouldn't.

If you're unconscious because you're [dying](conditions.md#Dying), you can't wake up while you have 0 Hit Points. If you are restored to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.

If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not [dying](conditions.md#Dying), you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.

If you're unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways. Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.

- You take damage, provided the damage doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.
- You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.
- Someone shakes you awake with an Interact action.
- There's loud noise going on around you—though this isn't automatic. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their [Stealth](../compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DCs. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you to attempt this Perception check.
- If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 622_

## Undetected

When you are undetected by a creature, that creature cannot see you at all, has no idea what space you occupy, and can't target you, though you still can be affected by abilities that target an area. When you're undetected by a creature, that creature is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you.

A creature you're undetected by can guess which square you're in to try targeting you. It must pick a square and attempt an attack. This works like targeting a [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) creature (requiring a DC 11 flat check, as described on page 466), but the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM, who doesn't reveal whether the attack missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll, or choosing the wrong square.

A creature can use the [Seek](actions/seek.md) action to try to find you, as described on page 471.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 623_

## Unfriendly

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters. A creature that is unfriendly to a character dislikes and specifically distrusts that character. The unfriendly creature won't accept Requests from the character.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 623_

## Unnoticed

If you are unnoticed by a creature, that creature has no idea you are present at all. When you're unnoticed, you're also [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) by the creature. This condition matters for abilities that can be used only against targets totally unaware of your presence.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 623_

## Wounded

You have been seriously injured. If you lose the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition and do not already have the wounded condition, you become wounded 1. If you already have the wounded condition when you lose the dying condition, your wounded condition value increases by 1. If you gain the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition while wounded, increase your [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition value by your wounded value.

The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with [Treat Wounds](actions/treat-wounds.md), or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.
