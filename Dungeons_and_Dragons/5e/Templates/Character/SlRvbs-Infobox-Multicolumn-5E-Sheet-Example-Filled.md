Racial Features

### Darkvision

Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.

### __Keen Senses__

You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

### __Fey Ancestry__

You have advantage on saves against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

### __Trance__

You don't need to sleep but meditate semiconsciously for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

### Ability Score Increase

Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

### Elf Weapon Training

You have proficiency with the Longsword, Shortsword, Shortbow, and Longbow.

### Fleet of Foot

Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

### Mask of the Wild

You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

## Primeval Awareness

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favoured terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.

## __Unarmed Strike__

You can punch, kick, head-butt, or use a similar forceful blow and deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + STR modifier

## __ACTIONS •__ Attacks per Action: 2

## Colossus Slayer

Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

### Sharpshooter - Feat

You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

*   Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
* Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
* Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a - 5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage
