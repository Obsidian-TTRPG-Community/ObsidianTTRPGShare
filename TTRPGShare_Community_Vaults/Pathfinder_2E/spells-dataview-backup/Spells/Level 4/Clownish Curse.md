description: >
  You afflict the target with a curse that causes it to emit ridiculous noises as it moves. Furthermore, the target's hands and feet become awkward and uncoordinated, as though it were wearing oversized gloves and shoes.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** For 1 round, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting an Acrobatics, Stealth, or Thievery check. If the target rolls a failure at an Acrobatics, Stealth, or Thievery check, it gets a critical failure instead.
  &NewLine;**Failure** As success, but the effect is 1 hour.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** As success, except the effect is permanent.
