You issue a diabolic edict, demanding the target perform a particular task and offering rewards for its fulfillment. It gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks related to performing the task.

If it refuses to perform the task you proclaimed, it instead takes a –1 status penalty to all its attack rolls and skill checks.
