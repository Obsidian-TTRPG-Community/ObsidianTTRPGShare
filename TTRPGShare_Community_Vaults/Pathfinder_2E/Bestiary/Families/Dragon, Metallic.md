# Dragon, Metallic

*Source* Bestiary pg. 116

---

Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.

In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.

## Shape-Changing Dragons

Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:

- __Change Shape ►__ ([Arcane](../../Traits/Arcane.md), [Concentrate](../../Traits/Concentrate.md), [Polymorph](../../Traits/Polymorph.md), [Transmutation](../../Traits/Transmutation.md)); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn't change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).

## Metallic Dragon Spellcasters

Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon's Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.

## Metallic Dragons on Golarion

Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons' territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.

Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.

### Apsu

Apsu, the Waybringer, is the god of good dragons, leadership, and peace. According to draconic lore, Apsu spawned the dragon-gods who created the world. One of his sons is the destructive draconic god Dahak. Thus, Apsu is not only seen as a god and creator to good dragons, but he also serves as an immortal father figure.

### Dahak

Dahak, the Endless Destruction, is an ancient dragon god spawned by the righteous Apsu. Dahak is the god of destruction, evil dragons, and greed. After his birth, Dahak made his way to Hell where he roamed for ages before returning to the Material Plane to fight against his father and siblings, reveling in destruction and pledging to destroy the world.

### Dragons on Other Planes

On the planet Triaxus the Wanderer, the seventh world from Golarion’s sun, dragons rule entire continents. There, ancient dragons maintain city-states and nations. In a vast region known as the Drakelands, chromatic dragons have subjugated the humanoid inhabitants and frequently war among themselves. However, a few good dragons maintain holdings there. In the region knowns as the Skyfire Mandate, a different dynamic exists: good dragons who chose to work in harmony with the humanoid inhabitants have created a buffer against the tyrants of the Drakelands. There, creatures known as dragonkin work alongside humanoids to patrol the border, making up a group known as the Dragon Legion.

### Other Draconic Creatures

The creatures that appear in this section are considered true dragons, but a multitude of other draconic creatures populate Golarion and beyond. Among these are the powerful and deadly linnorms, a wide range of drakes, whimsical faerie dragons and pseudodragons, the cruel and deceitful azis, and the sinister undead raveners.
