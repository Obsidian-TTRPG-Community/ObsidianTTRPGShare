[[### Barber]]
`=this.traits`


Haircuts, dentistry, bloodletting, and surgery—if it takes a steady hand and a razor, you do it. You may have taken to the road to expand your skills, or to test yourself against a world that leaves your patients so battered and bruised.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Medicine]] skill and the [[Surgery Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Risky Surgery]] skill feat.
