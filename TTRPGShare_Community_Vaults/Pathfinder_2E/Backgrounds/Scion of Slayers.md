[Scion of Slayers](###%20Scion%20of%20Slayers)
`=this.traits`


You were born into a lineage of undead slayers. No mere occupation, in your family slaying is a mantle of almost mystic responsibility passed from parent to child. Over the generations, this single-minded focus has begun to manifest in uncanny ways during combat.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](Athletics) skill and the [Undead Lore](Undead%20Lore) skill. You can cast [disrupt undead](../Spells_Rituals/Arcane_Tradition/Cantrips/Disrupt%20Undead.md) as an innate divine cantrip.

You can use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for this innate spell.
