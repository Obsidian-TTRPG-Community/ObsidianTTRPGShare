[[### Pathfinder Recruiter]]
`=this.traits`


The Pathfinder Society's always on the lookout for talent, but that talent rarely just stumbles into the Grand Lodge. Whether you're professionally trained to encourage new recruits or the [[Society]]'s own scouts identified your potential and raised you from childhood, you're committed to expanding the [[Society]]'s roster.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Diplomacy]] skill and a [[Lore]] skill related to one city you've visited often. You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
