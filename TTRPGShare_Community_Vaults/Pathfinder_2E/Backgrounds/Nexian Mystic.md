[[### Nexian Mystic]]
`=this.traits`


Your initiations into the Nexian mysteries and the philosophies of the Arclords of Nex grant you a preternatural comprehension of the arcane underpinnings of existence.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Arcana]] skill and a [[Lore]] skill related to one plane of your choice (other than the Material Plane). You gain the [[Arcane Sense]] skill feat.
