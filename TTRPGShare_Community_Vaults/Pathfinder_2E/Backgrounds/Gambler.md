[[### Gambler]]
`=this.traits`


The thrill of the win drew you into games of chance. This might have been a lucrative sideline that paled in comparison to the real risks of adventuring, or you might have fallen on hard times due to your gambling and pursued adventuring as a way out of a spiral.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Deception]] skill and the [[Games Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Lie to Me]] skill feat.
