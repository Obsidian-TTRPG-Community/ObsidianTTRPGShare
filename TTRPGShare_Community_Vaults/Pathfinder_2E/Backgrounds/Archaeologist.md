[[### Archaeologist]]
`=this.traits`


You've excavated enough sites to know that ancient civilizations aren't lost; they're merely buried and waiting for the right scholar to unearth them and tell their story. You might have worked as a laborer or local guide before learning formal archaeological techniques.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Society]] skill and the [[Architecture Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Additional Lore]] skill feat related to an ancient culture or the history of a culture you've studied (such as [[Azlanti Lore]] or [[Osirian History Lore]]).
