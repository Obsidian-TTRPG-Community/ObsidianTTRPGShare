[Feybound](###%20Feybound)
`=this.traits`


You have spent time in the First World or another realm of the fey and aren't entirely the same person you were before.

Perhaps you made a purchase at the legendary Witchmarket or partook deeply of fey food and wine. Whatever the case, willingly or inadvertently, you made a bargain with the fey, the benefits of which come at a price.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You are trained in [Fey Lore](Fey%20Lore) and gain the Fey's Fortune free action. You must follow some rule or limitation as part of your pact with the fey. If you violate the rule, you lose Fey's Fortune until you receive the effects of a successful atone ritual using the [Nature](Nature) skill. The exact limitation is up to you and the GM, but the most common requirement is that you must fulfill a single request from any fey who knows your name.



> [!tip] Fey's Fortune (concentrate,fortune)
> **Frequency** 1 per day
> **Trigger**  You attempt a skill check and haven't yet rolled
> **Effect** Roll the skill check twice and use the better result.
