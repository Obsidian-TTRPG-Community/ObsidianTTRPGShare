[[### Desert Tracker]]
`=this.traits`


You're at home blazing trails in the burning sands, and you made a living guiding or following creatures in the desert. You might be a native nomad, an experienced desert guide, a naturalist, a bandit driven into the dunes by the law—or all of the above.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Survival]] skill and the [[Desert Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Experienced Tracker]] skill feat.
