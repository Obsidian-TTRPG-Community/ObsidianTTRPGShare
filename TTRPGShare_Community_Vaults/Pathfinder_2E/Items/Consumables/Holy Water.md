---
This vial contains water blessed by a good deity. You activate a vial of holy water by throwing it as a Strike. It’s a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn’t add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it.

Holy water deals `dice: 1d6|avg` [Good](../../Traits/Good.md) damage and 1 [Good](../../Traits/Good.md) splash damage. It damages only [fiends](../../Traits/Fiend.md), [Undead](../../Traits/Undead.md), and creatures that have a weakness to good damage.
