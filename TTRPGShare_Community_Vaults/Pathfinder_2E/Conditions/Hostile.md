# Hostile

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 620

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC.

A creature that is hostile to a character actively seeks to harm that character. It doesn't necessarily attack, but it won't accept [Requests](../Rules/Actions/Request.md) from the character.
