# Unfriendly

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 623

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC. A creature that is unfriendly to a character dislikes and specifically distrusts that character. The unfriendly creature won't accept [Requests](../Rules/Actions/Request.md) from the character.
