# Observed

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 621

Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid [detection](../Traits/Detection.md), such as by using Stealth to [Hide](../Rules/Actions/Hide.md), it can become [Hidden](Hidden.md) or [Undetected](Undetected.md) instead of [Observed](Observed.md).

If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When [Seeking](../Rules/Actions/Seek.md) a creature using only [Imprecise Senses](../Rules/Perception.md#Imprecise%20Senses), it remains [Hidden](Hidden.md), rather than [Observed](Observed.md).
