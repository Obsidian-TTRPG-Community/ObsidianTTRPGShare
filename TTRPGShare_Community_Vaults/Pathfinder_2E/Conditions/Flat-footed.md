# Flat-footed

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 620

You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC.

Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others—especially [conditions](Conditions.md)—can make you universally flat-footed against everything.

If a rule doesn’t specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say “The target is flat-footed.”
