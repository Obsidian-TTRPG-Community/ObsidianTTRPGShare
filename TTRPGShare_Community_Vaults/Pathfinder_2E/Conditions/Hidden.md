# Hidden

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 620

While you're hidden from a creature, that creature knows the space you're in but can't tell precisely where you are. You typically become hidden by using Stealth to [Hide](../Rules/Actions/Hide.md). When Seeking a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than [Observed](Observed.md). A creature you're hidden from is [Flat-footed](Flat-footed.md) to you, and it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails to affect you. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.

A creature might be able to use the [Seek](../Rules/Actions/Seek.md) action to try to observe you.
