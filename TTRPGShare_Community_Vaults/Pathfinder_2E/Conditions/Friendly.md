# Friendly

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 620

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC.

A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character. The character can attempt to [Make a Request](Make%20a%20Request) of a friendly creature, and the friendly creature is likely to agree to a simple and safe request that doesn't cost it much to fulfill. If the character or one of their allies uses hostile actions against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.
