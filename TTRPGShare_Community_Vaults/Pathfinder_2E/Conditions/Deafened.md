# Deafened

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 619

You can't hear. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to hear. You take a –2 status penalty to Perception checks for initiative and checks that involve sound but also rely on other senses.

If you perform an action with the [Auditory](../Traits/Auditory.md) trait, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost; attempt the check after spending the action but before any effects are applied. You are immune to auditory effects.
