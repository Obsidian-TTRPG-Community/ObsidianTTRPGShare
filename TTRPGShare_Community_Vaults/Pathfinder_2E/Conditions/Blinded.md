# Blinded

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 618

You can't see. All normal terrain is [[difficult terrain]] to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail [[Perception]] checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a â€“4 status penalty to Perception checks. You are immune to [Visual](../Traits/Visual.md) effects. Blinded overrides [Dazzled](Dazzled.md).
