# Invisible

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 620

While invisible, you can't be seen. You're [Undetected](Undetected.md) to everyone. Creatures can [Seek](../Rules/Actions/Seek.md) to attempt to detect you; if a creature succeeds at its Perception check against your Stealth DC, you become [Hidden](Hidden.md) to that creature until you [Sneak](../Rules/Actions/Sneak.md) to become undetected again.

If you become invisible while someone can already see you, you start out hidden to the observer (instead of undetected) until you successfully Sneak. You can't become [Observed](Observed.md) while invisible except via special abilities or magic.
