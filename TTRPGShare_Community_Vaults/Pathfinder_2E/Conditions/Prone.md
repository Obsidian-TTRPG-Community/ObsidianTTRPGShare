# Prone

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 621

You're lying on the ground. You are [Flat-footed](Flat-footed.md) and take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are [Crawl](../Rules/Actions/Crawl.md) and Stand. Standing up ends the prone condition.

You can [Take Cover](../Rules/Actions/Take%20Cover.md) while prone to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).

If you would be knocked prone while you're [Climbing](../Rules/Actions/Climb.md) or [Flying](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Actions/Fly), you fall (see [Falling](../Rules/Falling.md) for the rules on falling). You can't be knocked prone when [Swimming](../Rules/Actions/Swim.md).
