# Unnoticed

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 623

If you are unnoticed by a creature, that creature has no idea you are present at all. When you're unnoticed, you're also [Undetected](Undetected.md) by the creature. This condition matters for abilities that can be used only against targets totally unaware of your presence.
