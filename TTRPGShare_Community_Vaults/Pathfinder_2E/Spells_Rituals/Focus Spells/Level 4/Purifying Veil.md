Drawing on the purifying powers of water, you call forth a veil of fine water droplets suffused with holy energy. The veil surrounds the target. Everything on each side of the veil is [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) from creatures on the opposite side, but the water doesn't impede attacks or movement across the veil.

If the target moves through the veil, it takes `dice: 4d6|avg` good damage with a basic Will save. If the target leaves the veil, the spell ends.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The good damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
