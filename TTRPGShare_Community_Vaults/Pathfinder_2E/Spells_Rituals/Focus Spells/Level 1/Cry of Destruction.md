Your voice booms, smashing what's in front of you. Each creature and unattended object in the area takes `dice: 1d8|avg` sonic damage. If you already dealt damage to an enemy this turn with a Strike or spell, increase the damage dice from this spell to `dice: 1d12|avg`.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg` / `dice: 1d12|avg`.
