You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) 1. When it recovers from the [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) condition, its features revert to normal.  
**Failure** The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.  
**Critical Failure** The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.
