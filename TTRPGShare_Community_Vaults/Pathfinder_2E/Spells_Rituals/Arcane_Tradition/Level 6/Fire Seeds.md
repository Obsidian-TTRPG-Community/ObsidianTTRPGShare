Four acorns grow in your hand, their shells streaked with pulsing red and orange patterns. You or anyone else who has one of the acorns can toss it up to 30 feet with an Interact action. It explodes in a 5-foot burst, dealing `dice: 4d6|avg` fire damage. The save uses your spell DC, even if someone else throws the acorn.

Flames continue to burn on the ground in the burst for 1 minute, dealing `dice: 2d6|avg` fire damage to any creature that enters the flames or ends its turn within them. A creature can take damage from the continuing flames only once per round, even if it's in overlapping areas of fire created by different acorns.

When the spell ends, any remaining acorns rot and turn to ordinary soil.
