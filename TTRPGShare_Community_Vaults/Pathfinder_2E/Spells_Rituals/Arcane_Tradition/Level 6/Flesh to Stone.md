You try to turn the target's flesh into stone. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 for 1 round.  
**Failure** The target is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) condition from flesh to stone, the creature is permanently non-magically [Petrified](../../../Conditions/Petrified.md). The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) condition is removed.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is initially [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 2.
