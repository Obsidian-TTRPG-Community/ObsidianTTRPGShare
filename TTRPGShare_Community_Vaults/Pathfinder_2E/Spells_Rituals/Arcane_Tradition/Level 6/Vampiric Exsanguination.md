You draw in the blood and life force of other creatures through your outstretched arms. You deal `dice: 12d6|avg` negative damage to living creatures in the area.

You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage a single creature takes from this spell; calculate these temporary Hit Points using the creature that took the most damage. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
