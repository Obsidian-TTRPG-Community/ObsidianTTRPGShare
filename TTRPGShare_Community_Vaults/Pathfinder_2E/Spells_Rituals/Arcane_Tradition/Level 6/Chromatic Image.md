You call forth three illusory images of yourself, and each of the four of you takes on a different color, your colors all shifting each time someone attacks you. This has the effects of [Mirror Image](../Level%202/Mirror%20Image.md), except that whenever a foe destroys one of the images, roll `dice: 1d4|avg` to see which color the image was when it was destroyed. The attacker takes the corresponding effect.

- **Red** 5 fire damage and 5 mental damage.
- **Orange** 5 acid damage and 5 mental damage.
- **Yellow** 5 electricity damage and 5 mental damage.
- **Green** 5 poison damage and 5 mental damage, plus it's [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 1.
