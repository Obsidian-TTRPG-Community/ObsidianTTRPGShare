A flowing cloak of utter [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak. While outside under a starry night sky, you're also [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) as long as you remain still. When moving under a starry night sky, you are [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) instead.

Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, visual effect.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Failure** The creature is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) until the end of its next turn.  
**Critical Failure** The creature is [Confused](../../../Conditions/Confused.md) and [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) until the end of its next turn.
