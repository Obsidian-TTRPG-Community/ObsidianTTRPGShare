You curse the target with your outrage at being attacked. The effect is determined by the target's Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target can't observe you until the end of its turn, and if you're currently [Observed](../../../Conditions/Observed.md) by it, you become [Hidden](../../../Conditions/Hidden.md) to it.  
**Failure** As success, and for 1 minute, every time the target damages you, it can't observe you until the end of its turn.  
**Critical Failure** As success, and for an unlimited duration, the first time each round the target damages a creature, it can't observe that creature until the end of its turn. If it damages several creatures at once, the creature it can't perceive is chosen randomly among those creatures.
