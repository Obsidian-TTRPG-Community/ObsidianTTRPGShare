You pray over a [Dying](../../../Conditions/Dying.md) creature, drawing its shadow into your service as long as its owner is stooped at death's door. You summon a [greater shadow](greater%20shadow) in a space adjacent to the [Dying](../../../Conditions/Dying.md) creature. The greater shadow has its usual stats, with the following modifications:

- The greater shadow's shadow hand Strike deals an additional `dice: 1d8|avg` poison damage.
- When you Cast a Spell, you can use the greater shadow's location as the origin point instead of your own location. Upon doing so, the greater shadow immediately disappears.  
If the [Dying](../../../Conditions/Dying.md) creature targeted by this spell dies or regains consciousness, the greater shadow disappears and this spell ends.
