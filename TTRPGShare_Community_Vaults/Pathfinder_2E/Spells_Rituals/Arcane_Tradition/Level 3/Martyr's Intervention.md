You shield a creature in dire need with your own life force, taking the harm upon yourself to save their life. The target is reduced to 1 Hit Point instead of 0 Hit Points. All remaining damage that was prevented from harming the target creature is instead dealt to you. Both you and the target become [Wounded](../../../Conditions/Wounded.md) 1; targets who are already [Wounded](../../../Conditions/Wounded.md) increased their [Wounded](../../../Conditions/Wounded.md) value by 1.
