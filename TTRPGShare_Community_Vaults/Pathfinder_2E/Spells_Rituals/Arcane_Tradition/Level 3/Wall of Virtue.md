You create a translucent wall of light, which draws power from the celestial realms. You create either a 5-foot-thick wall in a straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high or a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius ring with the same height. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side and dim light for the next 20 feet.

If the light passes through an area of magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) or targets a creature affected by magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), wall of virtue attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) the [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness).

Any creature that crosses the wall or is occupying the wall's area at the start of its turn takes `dice: 1d8|avg` good damage and `dice: 1d8|avg` positive damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The good damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`, and the positive damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
