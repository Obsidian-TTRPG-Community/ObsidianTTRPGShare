You and all targets are [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) except to each other as long as you remain within the spell's area. If a creature made [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature made [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) by this spell uses a [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action, the spell ends after the [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action is completed.

While exploring, it's easy to move together slowly and remain [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md). This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) until at most the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends.
