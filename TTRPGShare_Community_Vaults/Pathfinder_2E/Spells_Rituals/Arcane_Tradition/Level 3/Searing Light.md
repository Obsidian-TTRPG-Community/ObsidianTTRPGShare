You shoot a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals `dice: 5d6|avg` fire damage. If the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra `dice: 5d6|avg` good damage.

**Critical Success** The target takes double fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.  
**Success** The target takes full damage.

If the light passes through an area of magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) or targets a creature affected by magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), searing light attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) the [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness). If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
