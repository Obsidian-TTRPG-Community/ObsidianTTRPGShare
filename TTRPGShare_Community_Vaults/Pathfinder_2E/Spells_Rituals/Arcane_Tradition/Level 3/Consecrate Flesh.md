Through the strength of your faith, your body becomes infused with holy energy. You have weakness 5 to evil. Any creature that touches or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon takes `dice: 1d6|avg` good damage. Your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1 good damage. Your healing spells that restore Hit Points restore an additional `dice: 1d4|avg` Hit Points when you initially cast them; as normal, if your healing spell restores Hit Points more than once, grants fast healing, or the like, the additional Hit Points still only apply once.

<hr>
**Heightened (+3)** Creatures touching you take `dice: 1d6|avg` additional good damage, your unarmed Strikes deal 1 additional good damage, your healing spells restore `dice: 1d4|avg` more additional Hit Points, and your weakness to evil increases by 5.
