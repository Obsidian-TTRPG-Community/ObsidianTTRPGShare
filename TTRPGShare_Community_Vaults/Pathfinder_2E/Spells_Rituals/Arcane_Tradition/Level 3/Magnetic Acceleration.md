You magnetize a small metal object, such as a nail or coin, and launch it away from you at massive speed. Make a ranged spell attack roll; if the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you gain a `dice: 1d20+1|avg|nodice` circumstance bonus to your attack roll with magnetic acceleration. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 3d6|avg` bludgeoning damage and `dice: 3d6|avg` piercing damage, or double damage on a critical hit.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning and piercing damage each increase by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
