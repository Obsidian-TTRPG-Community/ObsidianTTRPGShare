You assault the target's faith, riddling the creature with doubt and mental turmoil that deal `dice: 6d6|avg` mental damage, or `dice: 6d8|avg` mental damage if it can cast divine spells. The effects are determined by its Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage; if the target can cast divine spells, it's [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) 1 for 1 round.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) 1 for 1 round, and can't cast divine spells for 1 round.

To many deities, casting this spell on a follower of your own deity without significant cause is anathema.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg` (or by `dice: 2d8|avg` if the target is a divine spellcaster).
