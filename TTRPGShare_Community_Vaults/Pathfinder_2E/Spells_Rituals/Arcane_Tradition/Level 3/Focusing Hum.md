You infuse the air around you with a sustained hum that allows creatures within it to resist distractions. The DC of any flat check to Cast a Spell while [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) for creatures within the area is 2 lower. [Confused](../../../Conditions/Confused.md) creatures in the area don't attack anyone, including themselves, and instead lose the ability to speak coherently. You take a –2 penalty to Stealth checks to [Hide](../../../Rules/Actions/Hide.md) and [Sneak](../../../Rules/Actions/Sneak.md).
