Your words fascinate your targets. You speak or sing without interruption throughout the casting and duration. Targets who notice your speech or song might give their undivided attention; each target must attempt a Will save. The GM might grant a circumstance bonus (to a maximum of +4) if the target is of an opposing religion, ancestry, or political leaning, or is otherwise unlikely to agree with what you're saying.

Each creature that comes within range has to attempt a save when you Sustain the Spell. If you're speaking, enthrall gains the linguistic trait.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and notices that you tried to use magic.  
**Success** The target needn't pay attention but doesn't notice you tried to use magic (it might notice others are enthralled).  
**Failure** The target is [Fascinated](../../../Conditions/Fascinated.md) with you. It can attempt another Will save if it witnesses actions or speech with which it disagrees. If it succeeds, it's no longer [Fascinated](../../../Conditions/Fascinated.md) and is temporarily immune for 1 hour. If the target is subject to a [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) act, or if another creature succeeds at a Diplomacy or Intimidation check against it, the fascination ends immediately.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target can't attempt a save to end the fascination if it disagrees with you.
