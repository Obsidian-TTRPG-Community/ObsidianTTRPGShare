You sigh, and your breath transforms into delicate, black-winged butterflies and huge death's-head hawkmoths. They flutter about you briefly, and then range forth in search of sustenance— fresh-spilled blood, by preference, but rotting corpses, flowering plants, or even left-behind food will do in a pinch. They then return, perching on your hair or shoulders and whispering their secrets into your ears. This has three effects.

- You heal `dice: 2d4|avg` Hit Points every 10 minutes.
- The first time during the duration when someone successfully [Treats your Wounds](../../../Rules/Actions/Treat%20Wounds.md), you regain an additional `dice: 4d4|avg` Hit Points.
- You gain an imprecise sense out to 30 feet that senses only freshly spilled blood and rotten flesh.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of Hit Points healed every 10 minutes increases by `dice: 1d4|avg` and the amount of Hit Points regained from the first Treat Wounds increases by `dice: 2d4|avg`.
