You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to detect via magic. Nondetection attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) all detection, revelation, and scrying divinations made against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips as 1st-level spells for this purpose. Successfully [counteracting](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) a divination that targets an area or multiple targets negates the effects only for nondetection's target.
