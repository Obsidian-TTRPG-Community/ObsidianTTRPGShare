You cause the surface to heave. The area becomes difficult terrain and any tracks in the area are destroyed by the churning ground. Creatures standing in the area take a –1 status penalty to Acrobatics checks to [Balance](../../../Rules/Actions/Balance.md) and [Tumble Through](../../../Rules/Actions/Tumble%20Through.md) and Athletics checks to [High Jump](../../../Rules/Actions/High%20Jump.md) and [Long Jump](../../../Rules/Actions/Long%20Jump.md). The first time each round you Sustain the Spell, you can move the churning area up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md) by the spell are carried along with the shifting sand in the same direction, if possible; this movement is [Forced Movement](../../../Rules/Forced%20Movement.md). Creatures that enter or begin their turn standing in the shifting sand must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and ignores the area’s difficult terrain and penalty to skill checks until the end of its turn.  
**Success** The creature ignores the area’s penalty to skill checks until the end of its turn.  
**Failure** The creature is affected normally by the spell this turn.
