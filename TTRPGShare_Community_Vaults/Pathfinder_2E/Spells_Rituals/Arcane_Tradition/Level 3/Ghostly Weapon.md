The target weapon becomes translucent and ghostly, and it can affect material and [Incorporeal](../../../Traits/Incorporeal.md) creatures and objects. It can be wielded by a corporeal or incorporeal creature and gains the effects of the [Ghost Touch](../../../Items/Runes/Weapon%20Property%20Runes/Ghost%20Touch.md) property rune. If the weapon is [Magical](../../../Traits/Magical.md) and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain ghost touch.
