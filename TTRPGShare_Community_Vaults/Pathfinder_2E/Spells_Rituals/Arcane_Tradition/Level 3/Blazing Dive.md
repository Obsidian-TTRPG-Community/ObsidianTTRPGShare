Superheated air collects under you, buoying you high into the sky before you plummet back down in a fiery comet. You Fly 15 feet straight up into the air, then Fly in a straight line to an empty space of your choice on the ground within 60 feet. When you land, the blistering air blasts out from you, dealing `dice: 3d4|avg` bludgeoning damage and `dice: 3d6|avg` fire damage (basic Reflex save) to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4 bludgeoning and 1d6 fire.
