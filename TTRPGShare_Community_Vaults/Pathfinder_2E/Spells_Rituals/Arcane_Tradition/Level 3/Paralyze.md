You block the target's motor impulses before they can leave its mind, threatening to freeze the target in place. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1.  
**Failure** The target is [Paralyzed](../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md) for 1 round.  
**Critical Failure** The target is [Paralyzed](../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md) for 4 rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, or end it entirely on a critical success.

<hr>

**Heightened (7th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
