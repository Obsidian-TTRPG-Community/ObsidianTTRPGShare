This potentially collapses structures with the collapse effect of the earthquake spell, except there is no chance of falling into a fissure;
	- Depart Web Hurricane Bezravnis departs with a hurricane of webbing. All creatures within a 50-foot emanation must succeed at a Reflex save or take a –20-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes (or is [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md) until it escapes on a critical failure).
