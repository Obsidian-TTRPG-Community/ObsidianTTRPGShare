You instantly destroy the incoming spell, though at the cost of sending magical feedback through your body. You automatically [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) the spell, but the feedback brings you unavoidable harm. You lose `dice: 1d8|avg` Hit Points per level of the triggering spell.
