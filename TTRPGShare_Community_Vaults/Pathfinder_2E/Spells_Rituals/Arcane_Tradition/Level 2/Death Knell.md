You snuff the life out of a creature on the brink of death. The target must attempt a Will save. If this kills it, you gain 10 temporary HP and a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 10 minutes.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target's [Dying](../../../Conditions/Dying.md) value increases by 1.  
**Failure** The target dies.
