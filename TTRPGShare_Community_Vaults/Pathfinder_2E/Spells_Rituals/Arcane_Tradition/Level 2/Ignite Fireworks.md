A brilliant and clamorous display of sparks and colorful fireworks explode around your enemies, dealing `dice: 1d8|avg` fire damage and `dice: 1d8|avg` sonic damage to creatures within a 10-foot burst. All creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage and is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 round.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 3 rounds.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, takes `dice: 1d4|avg` persistent fire damage, and is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 minute.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The initial fire damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`, the sonic damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`, and the persistent fire damage a creature takes on a critical failure increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
