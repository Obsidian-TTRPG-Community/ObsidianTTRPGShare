Three faintly glowing wisps of fire float around your head. Each time you hit a creature with a Strike, one of the wisps goes hurtling towards that creature, dealing `dice: 1d4|avg` fire damage. If you Cast a Spell with the fire trait while you have fewer than three wisps, a new wisp appears.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4.
