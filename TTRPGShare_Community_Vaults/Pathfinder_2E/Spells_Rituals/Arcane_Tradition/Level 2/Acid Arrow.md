You conjure an arrow of acid that continues corroding the target after it hits. Make a spell attack against the target. On a hit, you deal `dice: 3d8|avg` acid damage plus `dice: 1d6|avg` persistent acid damage. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md).

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 2d8, and the persistent acid damage increases by 1d6.
