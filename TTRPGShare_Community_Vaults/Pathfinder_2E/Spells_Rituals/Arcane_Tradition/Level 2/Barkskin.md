The target's skin becomes covered in bark. The target gains resistance 2 to bludgeoning and piercing damage and weakness 3 to fire. After the target takes fire damage, it can Dismiss the spell as a free action triggered by taking the damage; doing so doesn't reduce the fire damage the target was dealt.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The resistances increase by 2, and the weakness increases by 3.
