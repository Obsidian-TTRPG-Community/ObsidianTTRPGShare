You implant a mental mine within your psyche that detonates against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. You can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to suppress the effects of the mine for 1 round to allow someone to safely use a mental effect on you. You can Dismiss the spell.

The first creature that uses a magical mental effect against you triggers the animus mine, causing the spell to end. The animus mine deals 4d8 mental damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1. You are unaffected by the triggering mental effect.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8.
