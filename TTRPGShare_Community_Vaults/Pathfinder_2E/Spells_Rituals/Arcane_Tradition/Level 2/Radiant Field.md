You create an area of bright light. Creatures with [Light Blindness](../../../Bestiary/Abilities/Light%20Blindness.md) that are [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) by radiant field and remain in the area must attempt a Fortitude save at the start of their turns. On a failure, a creature remains [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) for 1 round; this is an incapacitation effect. This spell also suppresses magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level 2/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%202/Darkness) of your radiant field spell's level or lower.

<hr>

**Heightened (4th)** Creatures seen through the area are [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) to creatures with light blindness, even those that are outside the area.
