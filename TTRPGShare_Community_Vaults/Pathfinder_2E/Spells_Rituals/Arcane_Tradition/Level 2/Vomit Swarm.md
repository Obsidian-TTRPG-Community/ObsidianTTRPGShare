You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn't change the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone in the area, their bites and stings dealing `dice: 2d8|avg` piercing damage (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) 1. Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 1d8.
