Regret eats away at the target's mind, punishing it for its violence until it ceases its hostility. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** At the end of its next turn, the target takes 1d8 damage per different creature it intentionally damaged on that turn (`dice: 1d8|avg` if it damaged one creature, `dice: 2d8|avg` if it damaged two different creatures, and so on). The maximum is `dice: 4d8|avg` if it damaged 4 different creatures.  
**Failure** As success, except the curse damages the target at the end of each of its turns and lasts until the target spends a complete round without intentionally damaging another creature.  
**Critical Failure** As success, except the curse damages the target at the end of each of its turns and lasts until the target spends 24 hours atoning for its perceived sins.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The amount of mental damage the target takes for each creature it damaged that turn increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`, and the maximum damage the target can take per turn increases by `dice: 4d8|avg`.
