A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth— words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe. Your words deal `dice: 2d6|avg` persistent fire damage, and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half the persistent fire damage.  
**Failure** The target becomes [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 1 and takes the full persistent fire damage.  
**Critical Failure** The target becomes [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 2 and takes double the persistent fire damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** You can target two additional creatures, and the [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md) increases by 2d6.
