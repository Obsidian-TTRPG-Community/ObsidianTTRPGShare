You brand the target with an ethereal copy of your deity’s religious symbol. This brand can’t be [Hidden](../../../Conditions/Hidden.md), but it is visible only to followers of your faith, who see it as clearly as a lit torch. Followers of your faith ignore the target’s [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) condition, if any, and the target gains a –1 status penalty to AC against attacks by followers of your faith. If the target is a follower of your deity in good standing, the spell fails.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The spell lasts for 1 round.  
**Failure** The spell lasts for 1 minute.  
**Critical Failure** The spell has an unlimited duration.
