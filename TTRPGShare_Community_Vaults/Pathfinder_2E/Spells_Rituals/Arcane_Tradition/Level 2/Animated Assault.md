You use your mind to manipulate unattended objects in the area, temporarily animating them to attack. The objects hover in the air, then hurl themselves at nearby creatures in a chaotic flurry of debris. This assault deals `dice: 2d10|avg` bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex save) to each creature in the area. On subsequent rounds, the first time each round you Sustain this Spell, it deals `dice: 1d10|avg` bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex save) to each creature in the area.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 2d10 and the subsequent damage increases by 1d10.
