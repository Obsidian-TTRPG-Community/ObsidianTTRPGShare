You gain a +1 status bonus to the following checks regarding haunts or spirits: Perception checks to [Seek](../../../Rules/Actions/Seek.md), attempts to [Recall Knowledge](../../../Rules/Actions/Recall%20Knowledge.md), skill checks to determine the reason for their existence, and skill checks to disable a haunt.
