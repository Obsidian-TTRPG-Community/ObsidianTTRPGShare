You cloak the targets in an illusion, shaping their clothing and worn items into ones suitable for a particular occasion. You visualize the occasion, and the spell creates illusory attire customized to each target. For instance, if you visualized a noble ball, armor would appear to be fine clothing. This doesn't change identifying details of the targets' appearances other than their clothes.

Any creature that touches the attire, uses the [Seek](../../../Rules/Actions/Seek.md) action to examine it, or otherwise interacts with it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
