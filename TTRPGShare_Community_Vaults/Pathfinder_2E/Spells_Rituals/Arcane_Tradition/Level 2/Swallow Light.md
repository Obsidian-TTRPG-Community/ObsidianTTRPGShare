You draw magical light into your open mouth, consuming it and turning its essence into fuel for a gout of life-draining shadows. Attempt a [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) check against the light effect. If you successfully [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) it, you gain a breath weapon of chilling shadows you can use until the spell ends. Exhaling the breath is a two-action activity. The breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and deals `dice: 1d6|avg` cold damage plus `dice: 1d6|avg` negative damage. Creatures in the area can attempt a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. Once activated, you can't use the breath weapon again for `dice: 1d4|avg` rounds.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the damage of the breath weapon by `dice: 1d6|avg` cold damage and `dice: 1d6|avg` negative damage.
