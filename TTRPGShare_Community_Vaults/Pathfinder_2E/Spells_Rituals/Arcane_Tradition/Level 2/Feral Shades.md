A wave of gray mist formed of negative energy spills out from your outstretched hand, briefly taking the shape of a pack of predatory animals that set viciously on your foes. You deal `dice: 2d4|avg` slashing damage and `dice: 2d4|avg` negative damage to creatures in the area. The shades set upon the vulnerable with greater ferocity: [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md) creatures or those taking persistent bleed damage take a –2 status penalty to the save.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The slashing damage and the negative damage each increase by 1d4.
