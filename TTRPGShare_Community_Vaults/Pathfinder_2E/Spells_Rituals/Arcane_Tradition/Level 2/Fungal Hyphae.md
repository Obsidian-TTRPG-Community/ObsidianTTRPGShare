Thin hyphae grow from your feet and plunge into the earth, creating a symbiotic fungal network that attaches to plants within 30 feet and connects you to their root systems. You gain an imprecise [Tremorsense](../../../Bestiary/Abilities/Tremorsense.md) allowing you to sense anything directly touching plants within that distance. If you move, the hyphae snap and the spell ends.

**Heightened (4th)** You can control plants in the area to a small degree, allowing you to make Strikes with tree branches, exposed roots, or similarly solid plants. To do so, you use a Strike action, but you can Strike any creature you can detect with your tremorsense. These are melee spell attacks that deal `dice: 2d8|avg` bludgeoning damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Unusual plants, such as thorny vines, might deal a different type of damage at the GM’s discretion. You can’t make any other attacks through these plants, or take any other actions through them, other than these Strikes.  
**Heightened (6th)** As 4th level, but you can use other simple manipulate actions through the plants, including having a branch pick an object up or open a door, though more complex actions, such as picking a lock or disabling a trap, remain impossible.
