Powerful wards hide a creature from divination magic. The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against mental effects. Mind blank attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) any detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell level were 1 higher than its actual level.

On a success, the divination effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, [Detect Magic](../Cantrips/Detect%20Magic.md) would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.
