You fire a blue-white ray of freezing air and sleet that deals `dice: 10d8|avg` cold damage. Make a spell attack roll against the target.

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage and is [Drained](../../../Conditions/Drained.md) 2.  
**Success** The target takes full damage and is [Drained](../../../Conditions/Drained.md) 2.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d8|avg`.
