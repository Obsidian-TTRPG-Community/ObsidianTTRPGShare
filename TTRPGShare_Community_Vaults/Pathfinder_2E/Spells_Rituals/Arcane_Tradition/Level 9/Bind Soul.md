You wrench the target's soul away before it can pass on to the afterlife and imprison it in a black sapphire.

While the soul is in the gem, the target can't be returned to life through any means, even powerful magic such as [Wish](../Level%2010/Wish.md). If the gem is destroyed or bind soul is [counteracted](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) on the gem, the soul is freed. The gem has AC 16 and Hardness 10. A gem can't hold more than one soul, and any attempt wastes the spell.
