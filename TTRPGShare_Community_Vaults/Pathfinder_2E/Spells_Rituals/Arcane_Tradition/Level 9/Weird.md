You fill the targets' minds with terrifying images of fearsome creatures, each drawn from the targets' worst fears. Only the targets can see their assailants. Each target takes `dice: 16d6|avg` mental damage and must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage and is [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 1.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is frightened 2.  
**Critical Failure** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If the target succeeds, it takes double damage and is frightened 2, and it's also [Fleeing](../../../Conditions/Fleeing.md) until the end of its next turn unless it critically succeeded. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and dies.
