Fleeting notes of a strange and unnatural song fill the air, overtaking the mind. Each target must attempt a Will save when you cast the spell, and again the first time you Sustain the Spell each round. A creature needs to attempt only one save against the song each round, and you have to keep the same targets when you Sustain the Spell.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected, can't be affected on subsequent rounds, and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.  
**Success** The target is unaffected this round, but it can be affected on subsequent rounds.  
**Failure** Roll 1d4 on the table below.  
**Critical Failure** Roll 1d4+1 on the table below.

1. The target is [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 2.
2. The target is [Confused](../../../Conditions/Confused.md) for 1 round.
3. The target is [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) 4 for 1 round.
4. The target is [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) for 1 round.
5. The target is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) for 1 round and [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) 1 for an unlimited duration.
