You point your finger and project a bolt of magical energy that stutters in and out of phase until it reaches the target. Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC; if the target has any circumstance bonuses to AC (such as from a shield or cover), reduce that bonus by 2 for this attack. On a success, you deal 1d4 piercing damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The bolt's damage increases by 1d4.
