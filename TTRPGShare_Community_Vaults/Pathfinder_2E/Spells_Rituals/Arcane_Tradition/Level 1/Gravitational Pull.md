By suddenly altering gravity, you pull the target toward you. The target is [pulled](../../../Rules/Forced%20Movement.md) 10 feet closer to you unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. On a critical failure, it's also knocked [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md). The effects of this spell change depending on the number of actions you spend when you **Cast** this Spell.

► (somatic) The spell targets one creature.  
►► (somatic, verbal) The spell targets one creature and pulls the target 20 feet instead of 10.  
►►► (material, somatic, verbal) The spell targets up to 5 creatures.
