You soften the target's blows, ensuring they avoid vital areas and cause no lasting harm. All physical damage dealt by the target to living creatures becomes [Nonlethal](../../../Traits/Nonlethal.md) and all persistent bleed damage dealt by the target is reduced to 0.

This effect doesn't incur the typical –2 circumstance penalty for nonlethal attacks with a lethal weapon or attack. An unwilling target must attempt a Will save. A willing target can choose to critically fail their saving throw.

- **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected
- **Success** The creature is affected for 1 round
- **Failure** The creature is affected for 1d4 rounds
- **Critical Failure** The creature is affected for 1 minute
