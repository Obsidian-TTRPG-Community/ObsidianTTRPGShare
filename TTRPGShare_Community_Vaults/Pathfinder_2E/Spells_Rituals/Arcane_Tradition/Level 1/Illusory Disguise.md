You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself. The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, such as making your armor look like a dress. Held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.

Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for the [Impersonate](../../../Rules/Actions/Impersonate.md) use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and you add your level even if you're untrained. You can Dismiss this spell.

**Heightened (2nd)** The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the [Auditory](../../../Traits/Auditory.md) and [Olfactory](../../../Traits/Olfactory.md) traits.  
**Heightened (3rd)** You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual. You must have seen an individual to take on their appearance. The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait.
