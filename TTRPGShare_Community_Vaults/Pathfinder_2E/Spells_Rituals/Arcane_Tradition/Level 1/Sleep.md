Each creature in the area becomes drowsy and might fall asleep. A creature that falls [Unconscious](../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md) from this spell doesn't fall [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md) or release what it's holding. This spell doesn't prevent creatures from waking up due to a successful Perception check, limiting its utility in combat.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks for 1 round.  
**Failure** The creature falls [Unconscious](../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md). If it's still [Unconscious](../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md) after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.  
**Critical Failure** The creature falls [Unconscious](../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md). If it's still [Unconscious](../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md) after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically.

<hr>

**Heightened (4th)** The creatures fall [Unconscious](../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md) for 1 round on a failure or 1 minute on a critical failure. They fall [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md) and release what they're holding, and they can't attempt Perception checks to wake up. When the duration ends, the creature is sleeping normally instead of automatically waking up.
