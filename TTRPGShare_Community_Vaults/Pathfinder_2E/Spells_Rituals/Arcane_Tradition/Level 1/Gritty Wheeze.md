You exhale desiccating grit and sand in a small cloud. Creatures in the area take `dice: 2d4|avg` bludgeoning damage and must attempt a Fortitude save. Water creatures and plant creatures use the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their saving throw.

**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 round.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 minute.
