You place a hand on an object to learn a piece of information about an emotional event that occurred involving the object within the past week, determined by the GM. If you cast object reading on the same item multiple times, you can either concentrate on a single event to gain additional pieces of information about that event, or gain a piece of information about another emotional event in the applicable time frame.
