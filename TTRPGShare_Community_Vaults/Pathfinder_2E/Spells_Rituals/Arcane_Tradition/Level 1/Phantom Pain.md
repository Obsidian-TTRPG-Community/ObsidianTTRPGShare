Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes full initial damage but no [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md), and the spell ends immediately.  
**Failure** The target takes full initial and [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md), and the target is [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) 1. If the target recovers from being [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md), the [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md) ends and the spell ends.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) 2.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d4 and the [Persistent Damage](../../../Conditions/Persistent%20Damage.md) by 1d4.
