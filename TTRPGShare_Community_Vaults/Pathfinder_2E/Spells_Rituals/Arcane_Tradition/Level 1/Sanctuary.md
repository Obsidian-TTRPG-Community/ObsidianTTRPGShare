You ward a creature with protective energy that deters enemy attacks. Creatures attempting to attack the target must attempt a Will save each time. If the target uses a [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action, the spell ends.

**Critical Success** Sanctuary ends.  
**Success** The creature can attempt its attack and any other attacks against the target this turn.  
**Failure** The creature can't attack the target and wastes the action. It can't attempt further attacks against the target this turn.  
**Critical Failure** The creature wastes the action and can't attempt to attack the target for the rest of sanctuary's duration.
