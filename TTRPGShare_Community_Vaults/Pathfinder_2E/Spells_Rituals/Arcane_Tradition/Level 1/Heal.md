You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore `dice: 1d8|avg` Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of positive damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

 ► (somatic) The spell has a range of touch.  
 ►► (somatic, verbal) The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.  
 ►►► (material, somatic, verbal) You disperse positive energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
