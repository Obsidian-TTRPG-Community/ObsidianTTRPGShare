A spray of heavy rocks flies through the air in front of you. The rubble deals `dice: 2d4|avg` bludgeoning damage to each creature in the area. Each creature must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 2d4.
