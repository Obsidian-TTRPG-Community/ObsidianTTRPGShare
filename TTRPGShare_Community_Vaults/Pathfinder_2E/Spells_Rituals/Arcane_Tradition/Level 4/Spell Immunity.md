You ward a creature against the effects of a single spell. Choose a spell and name it aloud as part of the verbal component. Spell immunity attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) that spell whenever spell immunity's target is the target of the named spell or in that spell's area. **Success**fully [Counteracting](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) a spell that targets an area or multiple targets with spell immunity negates the effects only for the target affected by spell immunity.
