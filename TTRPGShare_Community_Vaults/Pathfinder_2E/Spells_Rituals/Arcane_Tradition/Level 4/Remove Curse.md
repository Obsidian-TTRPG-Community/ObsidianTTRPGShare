Your touch grants a reprieve to a cursed creature. You attempt to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) one curse afflicting the target. If the curse comes from a cursed item or other external source, a success indicates that the target creature can rid itself of the cursed item, but it doesn't remove the curse from the item.
