You inflict a curse upon the target that causes any wound to gush blood. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** For 1 minute, the first time each round that the target takes at least 10 piercing or slashing damage from a single Strike, it takes `dice: 2d6|avg` additional damage of the same type.  
**Failure** As success, but when it takes the additional damage, it also takes `dice: 2d6|avg` persistent bleed damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The additional damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg` and the persistent bleed damage increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
