You override a target's olfactory senses, luring them to a specific location through tantalizing false scents. Select a single square within range that is not hazardous or occupied by a creature. The target is drawn to the selected location, becoming euphoric upon arrival. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is distracted by the tantalizing scents, becoming [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) 1 for 1 round.  
**Failure** The target is [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) 2 and moves toward the selected location via the most direct route possible for 1 round, bypassing any obvious hazards and enemies in the way.  
**Critical Failure** The target is [Stupefied](../../../Conditions/Stupefied.md) 4 and moves to the selected location via the most direct route possible for 1 round, bypassing any obvious hazards and enemies in the way. If the creature reaches the destination, it must remain in that location for `dice: 1d4|avg` rounds but can otherwise act normally.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** You target 1 additional creature, selecting a different square within range as their destination.
