You create an illusion that causes natural terrain to look, sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of terrain. This doesn't disguise any structures or creatures in the area.

Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the [Seek](../../../Rules/Actions/Seek.md) action to examine it can attempt to [disbelieve your illusion](../../../Rules/Disbelieving%20an%20Illusion.md).

<hr>

**Heightened (5th)** Your image can also disguise structures or create illusory structures (but still doesn't disguise creatures).
