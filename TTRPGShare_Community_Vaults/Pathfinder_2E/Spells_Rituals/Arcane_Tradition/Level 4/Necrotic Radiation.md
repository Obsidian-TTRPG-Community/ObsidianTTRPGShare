You imbue the touched object or space with slow-acting necrotic radiation. If you cast the spell on an object, any creature ending its turn holding or carrying the object takes `dice: 2d6|avg` negative damage. If you cast the spell on an area, any creature ending its turn in the area takes `dice: 2d6|avg` negative damage. You can attempt to use this spell on an attended object by touching the object. If you do, the creature attempts a Reflex save to reduce the effect.

**Critical Success** The object is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature pulls the object away quickly. The spell only lasts 1 minute.  
**Failure** The creature manages to slightly protect the object. The spell lasts 10 minutes.  
**Critical Failure** The spell lasts the full 24 hours.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the radiation's negative damage by `dice: 1d6|avg`
