You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You gain resistance 5 to all damage (except force). You can Sustain the Spell to vanish and reappear 10 feet away in a random direction determined by the GM; the movement doesn't trigger reactions. At the end of your turn, you vanish and reappear as above.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 3.
