A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals `dice: 4d4|avg` piercing damage and `dice: 4d4|avg` negative damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary HP equal to the negative damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary HP after 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage.  
**Failure** The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md) by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md) by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it Escapes (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The piercing and negative damage increase by `dice: 1d4|avg` each.
