You send disturbing nightmares to your target. The next time the target falls asleep, it must attempt a Will save. If you know the target only by name and have never met them, the target gets a +4 circumstance bonus to the Will save.

**Critical Success** The target suffers no adverse effects and is temporarily immune for 1 week.  
**Success** The target experiences the nightmares but suffers no adverse effects other than unpleasant memories.  
**Failure** The target experiences the nightmares and awakens [Fatigued](../../../Conditions/Fatigued.md).  
**Critical Failure** The target experiences the nightmares, awakens [Fatigued](../../../Conditions/Fatigued.md), and is [Drained](../../../Conditions/Drained.md) 2 until it is no longer [Fatigued](../../../Conditions/Fatigued.md).
