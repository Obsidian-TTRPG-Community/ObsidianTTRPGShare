Razor sharp coral growths erupt from the ground, transforming the landscape into a dangerous coral reef. You can create a third nonoverlapping burst if the centers of all three bursts are underwater. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take `dice: 6d6|avg` piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes `dice: 1d6|avg` persistent bleed damage. The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain.

A creature that moves through the area takes 3 piercing damage for every square of that area it moves into.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The initial piercing damage increases by `dice: 3d6|avg`, and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1.
