You afflict the target with a curse that causes it to emit ridiculous noises as it moves. Furthermore, the target’s hands and feet become awkward and uncoordinated, as though it were wearing oversized gloves and shoes.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** For 1 round, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting an Acrobatics, Stealth, or Thievery check. If the target rolls a failure at an Acrobatics, Stealth, or Thievery check, it gets a critical failure instead.  
**Failure** As success, but the effect is 1 hour.  
**Critical Failure** As success, except the effect is permanent.
