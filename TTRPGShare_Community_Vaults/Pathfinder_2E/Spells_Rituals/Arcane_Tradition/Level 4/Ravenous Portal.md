You place a ward upon the door that triggers when a creature attempts to open, unlock, or destroy the door. When that happens, the door transforms into a [mimic](../../../../../../../60-Wyrmscriber/Gamemaster/Mechanics/Bestiary/Mimics/Mimic.md) that can't move and is [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) to all creatures. When Casting the Spell, you designate yourself and up to 10 other creatures of your choice; these creatures don't trigger the ward, and the mimic is [Helpful](../../../Conditions/Helpful.md) to them instead of [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md). No effect can move the mimic unless it's also capable of moving the entire door. Once the door transforms into a mimic, it attacks creatures in its reach for up to 1 minute, and then the spell ends. If the mimic is killed before that time, the spell ends and the door returns to its normal form.

While turned into a mimic, the door can't be opened, unlocked, or bypassed—not even by the designated creatures. It's a creature, not a door, during that time. When the spell ends, the door returns to the state it was in before the ward was triggered.
