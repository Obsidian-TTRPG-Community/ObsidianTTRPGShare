You prove that slow and steady doesn't always win the race by turning a foe into a proverbial tortoise and yourself or an ally into a hare, siphoning some of the foe's speed and granting it to the other target. The effects depend on the foe's Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The targets are unaffected.  
**Success** The foe is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 for 1 round, and the other target is unaffected.  
**Failure** The foe is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 for 3 rounds and the other target is [Quickened](../../../Conditions/Quickened.md) for 1 round. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.  
**Critical Failure** The foe is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 for 3 minutes and the other target is [Quickened](../../../Conditions/Quickened.md) for 1 minute. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.
