You create a shimmering barrier that attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) [Teleportation](../../../Traits/Teleportation.md) effects and planar travel into or out of the area, including items that allow access to extradimensional spaces (such as a bag of holding).

Dimensional lock tries to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) any attempt to summon a creature into the area but doesn't stop the creature from departing when the summoning ends.
