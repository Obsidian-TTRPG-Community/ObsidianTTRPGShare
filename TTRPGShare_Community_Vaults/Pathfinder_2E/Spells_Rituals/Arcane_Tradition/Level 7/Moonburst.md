A powerful globe of chilling moonlight explodes in the area, dealing `dice: 8d10|avg` cold damage to creatures and objects in the area, plus `dice: 8d10|avg` additional positive damage to undead creatures. Moonburst's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. Each creature and object in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature or object is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature or object takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature or object takes full damage.  
**Critical Failure** The creature or object takes full damage. If it's a creature, it's [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) for an unlimited duration.

If the globe overlaps with an area of magical [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness), moonburst attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) the [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) effect.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by `dice: 1d10|avg`, and the positive damage against undead increases by `dice: 1d10|avg`.
