The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.

When any creature attempts a [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Failure** The creature becomes [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 2 before using its action.  
**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 2, and its action fails and is wasted.

<hr>

**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask of terror.
