An illusion of horrific creatures fills the spell's area. The creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters with a specific appearance of your choice, such as Hellish flies or animated saw blades. The burst deals `dice: 8d8|avg` mental damage (basic Will save) to each creature that's inside the burst when it's created, enters the burst, or starts its turn inside the burst.

A creature that critically succeeds at its Will save can immediately attempt to disbelieve the illusion. A creature that tries to [Interact](../../../Rules/Actions/Interact.md) with the monsters or observes one with a [Seek](../../../Rules/Actions/Seek.md) action can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion take no damage from the illusion thereafter.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
