You grasp a piece of the landscape—such as a tree, carriage, or piece of masonry—and lob it in your foe's direction. Your missile crashes down in either a 10-foot burst (for most missiles) or a 30-foot line (for something long and tall, like a tree or a ship's mast), dealing `dice: 14d6|avg` bludgeoning damage and turning its area into difficult terrain as it breaks into rubble. All creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save. If the area is a line, it doesn't have to start from your square but can instead start anywhere in range, as long as the entire area remains within range.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md).  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md), and is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`.
