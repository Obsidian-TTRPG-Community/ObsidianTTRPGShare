You place a palm to your lips and exhale a cold breath, whipping up a gust of wind that freezes the air's ambient moisture into a flurry of jagged shards. The flurry deals `dice: 9d6|avg` cold damage and `dice: 9d6|avg` slashing damage to all foes, with a basic Reflex save, but the gust flows harmlessly around your allies. The wind then picks you up and carries you to the other end of the area; though your movement within the gust can still trigger reactions, the storm of ice crystals prevents you from being affected by any effects, except for those that would [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) the spell's magic or that the GM decides would affect snow.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The cold and slashing damage each increase by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
