You become living flame, giving you fire immunity, resistance 10 to precision damage, and weakness 5 to cold and to water. Any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon takes `dice: 3d6|avg` fire damage.

Your unarmed attacks deal `dice: 1d4|avg` additional fire damage, and your fire spells deal one additional die of fire damage (of the same damage die the spell uses). You can cast produce flame as an innate spell; the casting is reduced from 2 actions to 1.

In fire form, you have a fly Speed of 40 feet and don't need to breathe.

**Heightened (9th)** Creatures touching you take `dice: 4d6|avg` fire damage instead of `dice: 3d6|avg`, your unarmed attacks deal `dice: 2d4|avg` additional fire damage, and you have a fly Speed of 60 feet.
