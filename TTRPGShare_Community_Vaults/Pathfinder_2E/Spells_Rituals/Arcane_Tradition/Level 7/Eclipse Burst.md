A globe of freezing [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness) explodes in the area, dealing `dice: 8d10|avg` cold damage to creatures in the area, plus `dice: 8d4|avg` additional negative damage to living creatures. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

If the globe overlaps with an area of magical light or affects a creature affected by magical light, eclipse burst attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) the light effect.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and becomes [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) by the darkness for an unlimited duration.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by `dice: 1d10|avg` and the negative damage against the living increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
