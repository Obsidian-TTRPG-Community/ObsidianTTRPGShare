You whip up a small sandstorm around your body. When a creature starts its turn in the area or moves into the area, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or become [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for as long as it remains in the area; it is then temporarily immune to this dazzling effect for 10 minutes.

Choose one of the following additional effects when you cast this spell. On subsequent rounds, you can switch to a different effect once per round as a free action triggered by sustaining the spell.

- **Sand Shield** You create a magical shield made of sand. The sand shield provides no benefit to AC, but it does allow you to use the Shield Block reaction and acts as a shield for this purpose. The sand shield has Hardness 14, 21 Hit Points, and no Broken Threshold; when the shield's HP are reduced to 0, you can't use its Shield Block reaction again until the next time you Sustain the Spell and choose the sand shield effect.
- **Sandblast** You direct a jet of sand at a single target. One creature of your choice within 30 feet takes `dice: 8d6|avg` slashing damage (basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, the creature is also [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 minute.
- **Sandstorm** The area of the spell expands to a 30-foot emanation, and any creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area takes `dice: 6d4|avg` slashing damage (basic Reflex save) and must hold its breath or begin suffocating.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the sand shield's Hardness by 2 and its Hit Points by 1, the sandblast damage by `dice: 1d6|avg`, and the sandstorm damage by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
