You unravel the magic of a spell that affects a container, door, or lock, converting it into energy you can repurpose to power your own spells. Attempt a [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) check against the target spell or magical effect that wards or seals a doorway or chest, such as [Lock](../Level%201/Lock.md), or against a spell or effect that deals damage or delivers secondary effects when it's opened, such as [Glyph of Warding](../Level%203/Glyph%20of%20Warding.md). If you succeed, you recover its energy, restoring one of your expended spell slots of 3rd level or lower.
