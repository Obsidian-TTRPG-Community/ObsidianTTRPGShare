You instantly teleport yourself and any items you're wearing or holding from your current space to a clear space within range that you can see. If this teleportation would bring another creature with you—even if you're carrying it in an [Extradimensional](../../../Traits/Extradimensional.md) container—the spell is lost. After you vanish but before you arrive, you can take up to 2 actions (or the number of actions you spent to cast momentary recovery, if it was fewer than 2 actions).

You can't target any other creatures or objects with anything during these actions and any effect with a duration that you create during these actions ends immediately when you arrive. After you arrive, you are [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 until the end of your next turn.
