The target of your spell is drawn into a long, twisting, extradimensional hallway blocked at 30-foot intervals with high-grade darkwood doors (Hardness 20, HP 80, BT 40, Athletics DC 30 to Force Open) secured with average locks (DC 25 Thievery, 4 successful checks required).

A creature trapped within this hallway can escape only when the spell expires, or when they successfully pass through the number of doors determined by their save, either by breaking through the doors or picking the locks (or any combination of these, if the target must pass through multiple doors to escape).

[Teleportation](../../../Traits/Teleportation.md) effects of 6th level or lower are automatically suppressed within the extradimensional hallway; higher-level teleportation effects require the caster to succeed at a [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) check against your spell DC or they fail.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is trapped for 1 round, or until it bypasses 1 door.  
**Failure** The target is trapped for 1 minute, or until it bypasses 2 doors.  
**Critical Failure** The target it trapped for 10 minutes, or until it bypasses 3 doors.
