You enchant a single object, preventing it from being used for magical observation. If you cast this spell on a non-magical item used to cast scrying spells, such as a [spell component pouch](spell%20component%20pouch) or a spell focus, the item can't be used to cast the spell. If you cast blind eye on a magical item that can be activated to scry (such as a [Crystal Ball](../../../Items/Held%20Items/Crystal%20Ball.md) or [Hag Eye](../../../Items/Worn%20Items/Other%20Worn%20Items/Hag%20Eye.md)), the item can't be activated for scrying effects. Magical items that are twice blind eye's spell level or more aren't blocked this way.
