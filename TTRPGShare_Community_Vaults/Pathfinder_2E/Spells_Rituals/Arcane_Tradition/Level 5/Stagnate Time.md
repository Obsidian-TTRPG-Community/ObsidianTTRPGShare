You examine the time stream in a particular area, then proceed to stick a few metaphorical pins into it, thickening and slowing down the flow of time until it rumbles along like a river of molasses. Any creature that begins its turn in the area must attempt a Will save.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Failure** The creature is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 this turn.  
**Critical Failure** The creature is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 2 this turn.
