Your head splits vertically into an enormous maw, which feasts upon the target's blood, dealing `dice: 12d6|avg` piercing damage, depending on your spell attack roll. After the spell, your head sews back together as if it had never split apart. You gain temporary Hit Points for 1 minute equal to half the piercing damage the target takes.

If you are a gug, increase the piercing damage by `dice: 2d6|avg` and increase the persistent bleed damage you deal on a critical hit by `dice: 1d8|avg`. This spell doesn’t alter a gug’s appearance.

**Critical Success** The creature takes double damage and `dice: 1d8|avg` persistent bleed damage.  
**Success** The creature takes full damage.  
**Failure** You miss and the creature takes no damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The piercing damage increases by `dice: 2d6|avg`, and the persistent bleed damage on a critical increases by 1.
