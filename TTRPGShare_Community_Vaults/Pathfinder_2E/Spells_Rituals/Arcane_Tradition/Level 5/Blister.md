You point at a target in range, and its skin grows searing blisters filled with caustic fluid. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target grows one blister. You can spend a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to pop a blister. The target and each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from the target takes `dice: 7d6|avg` acid damage (basic Fortitude save). You choose the direction of the cone, which can't include the target. When no blisters are left, the spell ends.  
**Failure** As success, but the target grows two blisters.  
**Critical Failure** As success, but the target grows four blisters.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage of a popped blister increases by `dice: 1d6|avg`.
