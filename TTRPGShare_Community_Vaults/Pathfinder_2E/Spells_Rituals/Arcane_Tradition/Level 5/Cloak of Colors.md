A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes a brilliant flash of light. A creature that hits the target with a melee attack must attempt a Will save.  
**Success** The attacker is unaffected.  
**Failure** The attacker is [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) for 1 round.  
**Critical Failure** The attacker is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) for 1 round.

The creature is temporarily immune until the end of its turn; this effect has the [Incapacitation](../../../Traits/Incapacitation.md) trait.
