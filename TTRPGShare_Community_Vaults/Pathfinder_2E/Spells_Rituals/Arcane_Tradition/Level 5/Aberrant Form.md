Harnessing the power of vile entities, you transform yourself into a Large aberration. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose chuul, gogiteth, gug, or otyugh. While in this form, you gain the [Aberration](../../../Traits/Aberration.md) trait. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 13 temporary Hit Points.
- [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level 2/Darkvision](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Magic/Spells/Level%202/Darkvision).
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +18, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [Enfeebled](../../../Conditions/Enfeebled.md) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- Athletics modifier of +20, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of aberration you choose:

- **[Chuul](Chuul)** _Speed_ 30 feet, swim 25 feet; **Melee ► claw** (reach 10 feet), Damage `dice: 2d8+8|avg` bludgeoning, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.
- **[Gogiteth](Gogiteth)** _Speed_ 40 feet, climb 30 feet; **Melee ► jaws**, Damage `dice: 2d10+8|avg` piercing, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target; **Melee ► leg** (agile, reach 10 feet), Damage `dice: 2d6+8|avg` piercing.
- **[Gug](Gug)** _Speed_ 40 feet, climb 20 feet; **Melee ► jaws** (reach 10 feet), Damage `dice: 2d12+8|avg` piercing; **Melee ► claw** (agile, reach 10 feet), Damage `dice: 2d8+8|avg` slashing; your multiple joints allow you to fit through tight spaces as if you were a Medium creature.
- **[Otyugh](Otyugh)** `dice: 1d20+2|avg|nodice` circumstance bonus on saves against disease; Speed 20 feet; **Melee ► jaws**, Damage `dice: 3d6+8|avg` piercing; **Melee ► tentacle** (agile, reach 10 feet), Damage `dice: 2d6+8|avg` bludgeoning.
