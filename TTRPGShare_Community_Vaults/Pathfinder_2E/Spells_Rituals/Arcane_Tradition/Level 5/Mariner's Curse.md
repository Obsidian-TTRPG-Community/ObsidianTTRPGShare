You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target becomes [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) 1. Reducing its [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) condition to 0 ends the curse.  
**Failure** The target becomes [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) 1 and can't reduce its [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by remove curse or similar magic. Whenever the target is [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes [Sickened](../../../Conditions/Sickened.md) 2.
