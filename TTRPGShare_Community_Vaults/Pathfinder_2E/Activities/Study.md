You give everything you have to your studies, in keeping with your branch. Choose either your primary or secondary branch and attempt a skill check with one of the branch's associated skills against a standard DC of the branch's level.

**Critical Success** Incredible results! You ace every exam and cause a stir that all the instructors notice. Increase the level of the branch you chose by 2.  
**Success** You succeed in your studies admirably. Increase the level of the branch you chose by 1.  
**Failure** You need to work harder and try again. Your branch level remains the same.  
**Critical Failure** You make a major mistake that requires you to perform remedial studies. The next time you would get an opportunity to attempt this activity, you must skip that opportunity to catch up.
