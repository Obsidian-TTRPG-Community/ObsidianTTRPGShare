You use legendary Vudran techniques to craft a disharmonic instrument that incorporates pieces of Kothogaz's heart. This is likely a tanpura, but legends mention other instruments and even voice enhancers. A disharmonic instrument is a [virtuoso musical instrument](../Items/Adventuring%20Gear/Musical%20Instrument.md).

This activity requires seven [disharmonic heartslivers](../Rules/Actions/Harvest%20Heartsliver.md), the formula for a disharmonic instrument, 55,000 gp worth of rare materials, and 7 days of work. At the end of the 7 days, attempt a DC 40 Crafting check to Craft.

**Critical Success** You masterfully complete the disharmonic instrument. Holding the instrument grants immunity to Kothogaz's tympanic heartbeat and many-eyed blight.  
**Success** You complete the disharmonic instrument.  
**Failure** You don't complete the disharmonic instrument, and you contract many-eyed blight from the heartslivers.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever you're on the same plane as Kothogaz, it can immediately teleport to you with its Disharmonic Door ability.
