# Shield Sconce *Item 0*  
[uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 1 sp
- **Category** Adventuring Gear

This carefully balanced metal bracket can be attached to the front or top of a shield or [tower shield](/compendium/equipment/items/tower-shield.md) (but not a [buckler](/compendium/equipment/items/buckler.md)), allowing you to carry a [torch](/compendium/equipment/items/torch.md) without giving up your shield or holding it in your other hand. While carrying a [torch](/compendium/equipment/items/torch.md) in this way, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check every time you use the [Shield Block](/compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction; on a failure, the [torch](/compendium/equipment/items/torch.md) is extinguished.
