# Greater Magical Scholastics  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archaeologist Dedication](/compendium/feats/archaeologist-dedication-apg.md), [Magical Scholastics](/compendium/feats/magical-scholastics-apg.md)

You broaden your magical studies, allowing you to find the right path, detect objects, and conceal those objects from unscrupulous rivals. You can cast [augury](/compendium/spells/augury.md), [locate](/compendium/spells/locate.md), and [nondetection](/compendium/spells/nondetection.md) as occult innate spells, each once per day. You can cast this [nondetection](/compendium/spells/nondetection.md) spell only on an object, and it is automatically heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from Magical Scholastics.
