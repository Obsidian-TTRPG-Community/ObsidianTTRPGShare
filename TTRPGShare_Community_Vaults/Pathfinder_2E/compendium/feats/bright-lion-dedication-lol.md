# Bright Lion Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: [Bright Lion](/compendium/character/backgrounds/bright-lion-lowg.md) background
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Bright Lions, not a worshipper of Walkena, trained in [Stealth](/compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

You become trained in your choice of [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](/compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and in [Mzali Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [Lie](/rules/actions/lie.md) or [Impersonate](/rules/actions/impersonate.md) to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.

## Bright Lion Dedication leads to...
