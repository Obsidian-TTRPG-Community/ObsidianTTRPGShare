# Living Monolith Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from the Golden Road region.
- **Prerequisites**: Ancient Osiriani and Sphinx languages, trained in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You've begun to inscribe a magical stone called a ka stone that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent ka stone. If you fail a recovery check while [dying](/rules/conditions.md#Dying), your [dying](/rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your [dying](/rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition increases by only 1. You become trained in [Ancient Osirion Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore), or expert if you were already trained.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the living monolith archetype.

## Living Monolith Dedication leads to...
