# Battle Medicine  [>](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[general](/rules/traits/general.md)  [healing](/rules/traits/healing.md)  [manipulate](/rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [skill](/rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](/compendium/skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: You are holding or wearing [healer's tools](/compendium/equipment/items/healers-tools.md) and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Single Action

You can patch up yourself or an adjacent ally, even in combat. Attempt a [Medicine](/compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check with the same DC as for [Treat Wounds](/rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), and restore a corresponding amount of Hit Points; this does not remove the [wounded](/rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition. As with [Treat Wounds](/rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then temporarily immune to your [Battle Medicine](/compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) for 1 day.

## Battle Medicine leads to...
