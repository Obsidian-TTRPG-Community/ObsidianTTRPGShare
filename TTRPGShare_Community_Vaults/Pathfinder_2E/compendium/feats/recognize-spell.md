# Recognize Spell  [R](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[general](/rules/traits/general.md)  [secret](/rules/traits/secret.md)  [skill](/rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Arcana](/compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](/compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](/compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](/compendium/skills.md#Religion)
- **Trigger** A creature within line of sight casts a spell that you don't have prepared or in your spell repertoire, or a trap or similar object casts such a spell.
- **Activity** Reaction

If you are trained in the appropriate skill for the spell's tradition and it's a common spell of 2nd level or lower, you automatically identify it (you still roll to attempt to get a critical success, but can't get a worse result than success). The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 10 if you're legendary. The GM rolls a secret [Arcana](/compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](/compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](/compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](/compendium/skills.md#Religion) check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you're not trained in the skill, you can't get a result better than failure.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You correctly recognize the spell and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it.
> - **Success** You correctly recognize the spell.
> - **Failure** You fail to recognize the spell.
> - **Critical Failure** You misidentify the spell as another spell entirely, of the GM's choice.
