# Edgewatch Detective Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 14 or Wisdom 14

You become trained in [Society](/compendium/skills.md#Society) or [Thievery](/compendium/skills.md#Thievery); if you are already trained in both of these skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can use [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) instead of [Survival](/compendium/skills.md#Survival) to [Track](/rules/actions/track.md), and you gain the [Experienced Tracker](/compendium/feats/experienced-tracker.md) skill feat (Core Rulebook 261).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the this archetype.
