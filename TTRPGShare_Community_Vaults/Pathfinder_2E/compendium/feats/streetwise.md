# Streetwise  *Feat 1*  
[general](/rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](/rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Society](/compendium/skills.md#Society)

You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement. You can use your [Society](/compendium/skills.md#Society) modifier instead of your [Diplomacy](/compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) modifier to [Gather Information](/rules/actions/gather-information.md). In any settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the [Recall Knowledge](/rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action with [Society](/compendium/skills.md#Society) to know the same sorts of information that you could discover with [Diplomacy](/compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Gather Information](/rules/actions/gather-information.md). The DC is usually significantly higher, but you know the information without spending time gathering it. If you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently attempt to [Gather Information](/rules/actions/gather-information.md) normally.

## Streetwise leads to...

[Criminal Connections](/compendium/feats/criminal-connections-apg.md), [Underground Network](/compendium/feats/underground-network-apg.md)
