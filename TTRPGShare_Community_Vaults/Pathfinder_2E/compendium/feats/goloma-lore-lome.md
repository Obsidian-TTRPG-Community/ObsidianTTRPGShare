# Goloma Lore  *Feat 1*  
[goloma](/rules/traits/goloma-lome.md)  


You lived an insulated life focused on avoiding danger. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Stealth](/compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and [Survival](/compendium/skills.md#Survival).

If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Goloma Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore).
