# Kitsune Spell Familiarity  *Feat 1*  
[kitsune](/rules/traits/kitsune-loag.md)  


You've picked up a few magical tricks. During your daily preparations, choose [daze](/compendium/spells/daze.md), [forbidding ward](/compendium/spells/forbidding-ward.md), or [ghost sound](/compendium/spells/ghost-sound.md). Until your next daily preparations, you can cast this cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
