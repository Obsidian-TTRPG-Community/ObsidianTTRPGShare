You are trained with the [battle axe](/compendium/equipment/items/battle-axe.md), [hatchet](/compendium/equipment/items/hatchet.md), [longsword](/compendium/equipment/items/longsword.md), and [shortsword](/compendium/equipment/items/shortsword.md). In addition, you gain the [Shield Block](/compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction.
