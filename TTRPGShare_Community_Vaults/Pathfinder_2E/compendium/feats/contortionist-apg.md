# Contortionist  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](/compendium/feats/acrobat-dedication-apg.md)

You can squeeze out of tight situations surprisingly quickly, gaining an advantage against foes that try to pin you down.

You gain the [Quick Squeeze](/compendium/feats/quick-squeeze.md) skill feat, and if you're a master in [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), you can [Squeeze](/rules/actions/squeeze.md) at full Speed. Whenever you successfully [Escape](/rules/actions/escape.md) using [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), the creature you [Escaped](/rules/actions/escape.md) from is [flat-footed](/rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next attack you make against it before the end of your next turn.
