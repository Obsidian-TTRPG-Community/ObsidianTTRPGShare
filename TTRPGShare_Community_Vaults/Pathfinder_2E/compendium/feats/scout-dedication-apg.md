# Scout Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](/compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and [Survival](/compendium/skills.md#Survival)

You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the [Scout's Warning (ranger)](/compendium/feats/scouts-warning-ranger.md) ranger feat. When you're using the [Scout](/rules/actions/scout.md) exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scout archetype.

## Scout Dedication leads to...
