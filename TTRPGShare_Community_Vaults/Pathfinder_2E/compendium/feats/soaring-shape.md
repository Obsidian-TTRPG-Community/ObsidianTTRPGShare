# Soaring Shape  *Feat 8*  
[druid](/rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wild Shape](/compendium/feats/wild-shape.md)

Wings free you from the shackles of the ground below. Add the bat and bird forms in [aerial form](/compendium/spells/aerial-form.md) to your wild shape list. If you have [Insect Shape](/compendium/feats/insect-shape.md), you also add the wasp form to your wild shape list. If you have [Ferocious Shape](/compendium/feats/ferocious-shape.md), you also add the pterosaur form to your wild shape list. Whenever you use wild shape to gain a form that grants you a specific [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) modifier, you gain a +1 status bonus to [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks.

## Soaring Shape leads to...

[Dragon Shape](/compendium/feats/dragon-shape.md), [True Shapeshifter](/compendium/feats/true-shapeshifter.md), [Reactive Transformation](/compendium/feats/reactive-transformation-apg.md)
