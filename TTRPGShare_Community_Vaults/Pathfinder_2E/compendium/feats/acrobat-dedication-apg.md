[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics)

You become an expert in [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics). At 7th level, you become a master in [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), and at 15th level, you become legendary in [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics). Whenever you critically succeed at an [Acrobatics](/compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Tumble Through](/rules/actions/tumble-through.md) an enemy's space, you don't treat the enemy's space as difficult terrain.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the acrobat archetype.
