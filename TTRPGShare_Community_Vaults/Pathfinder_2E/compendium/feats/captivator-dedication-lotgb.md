# Captivator Dedication  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 14, trained in [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](/compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)

Your ability to captivate others borders on the preternatural.

You are seldom at a loss in social situations, and you can create minor enchantments or illusions. Choose [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](/compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy). You become trained in that skill, or become an expert if you were already trained.

Choose two cantrips from the occult list; each cantrip must be from either the enchantment or illusion school. You gain access to the [Cast a Spell](/rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity and can cast these spells as occult innate spells. You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. If you have a hand free, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the captivator archetype.
