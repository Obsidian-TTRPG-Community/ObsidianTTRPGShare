# Vehicle Mechanic Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 14, trained in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You are adept at designing and maintaining mechanical vehicles, and you lavish your attention and ingenuity on one vehicle in particular. You become an expert in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting), and you choose one vehicle you own—or your party owns collectively—to be your signature vehicle: the vehicle you spend time customizing to grant it various advantages.

You can spend 1 week of downtime with a new vehicle to designate it as your signature vehicle instead. Due to your amazing customizations and adjustments, pilots gain a +1 circumstance bonus to any piloting checks they make to control your signature vehicle. If you are a master in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting), this bonus increases to +2.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the mechanic archetype.
