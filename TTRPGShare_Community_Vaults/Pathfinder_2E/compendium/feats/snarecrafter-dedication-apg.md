# Snarecrafter Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting), [Snare Crafting](/compendium/feats/snare-crafting.md)

You've learned to create a limited number of snares at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to [Craft](/rules/actions/craft.md), you can [Craft](/rules/actions/craft.md) them with 3 [Interact](/rules/actions/interact.md) actions. The number of snares increases to six if you're a master in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and eight if you're legendary. Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to [Craft](/rules/actions/craft.md).

**Special.** The feat counts as Snare Specialist for the purpose of feat prerequisites. If you also have the [Snare Specialist](/compendium/feats/snare-specialist.md) ranger feat, the quick snares from both feats are cumulative. You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter archetype.
