# Future Spell Learning  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Time Mage Dedication](/compendium/feats/time-mage-dedication-da.md)

More future memories of time magic percolate back to the present, teaching you spells you've yet to learn. Add [behold the weave](/compendium/spells/behold-the-weave-da.md), [cast into time](/compendium/spells/cast-into-time-som.md), [haste](/compendium/spells/haste.md), [loose time's arrow](/compendium/spells/loose-times-arrow-da.md), [quicken time](/compendium/spells/quicken-time-da.md), [slow](/compendium/spells/slow.md), and [stagnate time](/compendium/spells/stagnate-time-da.md) to your spell list. You can thus potentially learn these spells even if they aren't normally on your tradition's spell list.
