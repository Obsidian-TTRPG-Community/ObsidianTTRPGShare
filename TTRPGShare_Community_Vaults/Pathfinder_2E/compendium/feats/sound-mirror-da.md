# Sound Mirror  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](/compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

You twist not just the visual, but the auditory as well, allowing you to pass without a sound and create minor noises as distractions—perfect for misdirection and infiltration. You can cast [silence](/compendium/spells/silence.md) on yourself as a 2nd-level innate occult spell and [ventriloquism](/compendium/spells/ventriloquism.md) as a 1st-level innate occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast [ghost sound](/compendium/spells/ghost-sound.md) as an innate occult cantrip. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
