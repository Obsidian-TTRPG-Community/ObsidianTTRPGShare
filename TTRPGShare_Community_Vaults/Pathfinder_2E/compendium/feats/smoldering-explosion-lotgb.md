When you cast [fireball](/compendium/spells/fireball.md) heightened to at least 4th level, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: Your [fireball](/compendium/spells/fireball.md) leaves behind a brief cloud of smoke in its area. While it's smoke instead of mist, this cloud otherwise has the effects of [obscuring mist](/compendium/spells/obscuring-mist.md), except that it lasts only 1 round.
