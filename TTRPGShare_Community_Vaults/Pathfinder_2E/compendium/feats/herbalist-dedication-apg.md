# Herbalist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Nature](/compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Natural Medicine](/compendium/feats/natural-medicine.md)

You can create remedies and other herbal products. You gain the basic alchemy benefits (page 150), though they apply only for herbal items: alchemical items with the [healing](/rules/traits/healing.md) trait, plus antidote and antiplague. You gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level or half your level if you didn't make your daily preparations in the wilderness. Your advanced alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.

You become an expert in [Nature](/compendium/skills.md#Nature) and can use [Nature](/compendium/skills.md#Nature) instead of [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting) to [Craft](/rules/actions/craft.md) herbal items. You don't need to be trained in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting) or have the [Alchemical Crafting](/compendium/feats/alchemical-crafting.md) feat to do so, and you can use [healer's tools](/compendium/equipment/items/healers-tools.md) instead of alchemist's tools.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the herbalist archetype.
