If your rank is legendary, you gain 9.

Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to [Craft](/rules/actions/craft.md), you can [Craft](/rules/actions/craft.md) them with 3 [Interact](/rules/actions/interact.md) actions. The number of snares increases to six if you have master proficiency in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and eight if you have legendary proficiency in [Crafting](/compendium/skills.md#Crafting).
