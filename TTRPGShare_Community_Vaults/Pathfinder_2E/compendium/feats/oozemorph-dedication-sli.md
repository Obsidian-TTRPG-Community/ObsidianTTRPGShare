# Oozemorph Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You are plagued by sporadic anatomical rearrangements, which grant you insights into other creatures with unusual anatomies. You become trained in [Occultism](/compendium/skills.md#Occultism) and [Ooze Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves to avoid being Engulfed by creatures, and to checks to [Escape](/rules/actions/escape.md) after being Engulfed.

As you develop more abilities based on your amorphous affliction, you become increasingly off-putting to mundane creatures. You take a penalty to [Diplomacy](/compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks against animals and humanoids. This penalty is equal to your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype, to a maximum of –4 for four or more feats.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the oozemorph archetype.

## Oozemorph Dedication leads to...
