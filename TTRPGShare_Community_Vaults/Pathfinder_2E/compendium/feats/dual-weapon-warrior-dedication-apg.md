[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  


You're exceptional in your use of two weapons. You gain the [Double Slice](/compendium/feats/double-slice.md) fighter feat. This serves as Double Slice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the dual-weapon warrior archetype.
