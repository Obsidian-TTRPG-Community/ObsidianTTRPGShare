# Elven Lore  *Feat 1*  
[elf](/rules/traits/elf.md)  


You've studied in traditional elven arts, learning about arcane magic and the world around you. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Arcana](/compendium/skills.md#Arcana) and [Nature](/compendium/skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Elven Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore).
