# Entreat With Forebears  *Feat 2*  
[sorcerer](/rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: a bloodline that corresponds with a creature trait

Something about your presence causes creatures of your bloodline to, consciously or not, recognize you as one of their own, and you become inured to their tricks. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Diplomacy](/compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception), and [Intimidation](/compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks when interacting with creatures that have the trait corresponding to your bloodline, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) and saving throws against such creatures. For example, an aberrant bloodline sorcerer would gain this benefit against creatures with the [aberration](/rules/traits/aberration.md) trait. The GM is the final arbiter of which creatures match your bloodline.
