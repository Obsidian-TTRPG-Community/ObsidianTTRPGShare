# Red Mantis Assassin Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Mediogalti Island.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in sawtooth sabers, deity is [Achaekek](/compendium/setting/deities/achaekek-logm.md), lawful evil alignment, member of the Red Mantis assassins

You have learned how to stalk your foes and slay them with a sawtooth sabre. You become trained in [Stealth](/compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and [Assassin Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Whenever your proficiency in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you also gain that new proficiency with sawtooth sabers.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Red Mantis assassin archetype.
