[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [linguistic](/rules/traits/linguistic.md)  [skill](/rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](/compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md), master in [Society](/compendium/skills.md#Society)

All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Society](/compendium/skills.md#Society), or appropriate [Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore) check against your [Society](/compendium/skills.md#Society) DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.

Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your [Diplomacy](/compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks with them.
