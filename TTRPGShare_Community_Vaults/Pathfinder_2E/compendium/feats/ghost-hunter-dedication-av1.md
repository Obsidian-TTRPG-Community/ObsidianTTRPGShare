# Ghost Hunter Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Trained in [Occultism](/compendium/skills.md#Occultism) or [Religion](/compendium/skills.md#Religion)

You have focused your training on hunting and defeating ghosts, spirits, and all manner of haunts. [Pick Spirit Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Haunt Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore); you become trained in this skill. If you were already trained in both skills, you become trained in a new [Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill of your choice.

Choose two cantrips from the occult spell list. Each cantrip must have the divination, [enchantment](/rules/traits/enchantment.md), or [necromancy](/rules/traits/necromancy.md) trait. You can cast these spells as innate occult spells. You gain access to the [Cast a Spell](/rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity if you didn't have it already.

You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. You can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the ghost hunter archetype.
