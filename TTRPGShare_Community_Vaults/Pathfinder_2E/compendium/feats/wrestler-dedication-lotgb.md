- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](/compendium/skills.md#Athletics), unarmed attacks, and unarmored defense

Your training in the wrestling arts has made you particularly adept at moving, striking, and grappling while unencumbered.

You don't take the –2 circumstance penalty for making a lethal attack with your nonlethal unarmed attacks. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude DC when resisting an opponent's attempts to [Grapple](/rules/actions/grapple.md) you or Swallow you Whole.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the wrestler archetype.
