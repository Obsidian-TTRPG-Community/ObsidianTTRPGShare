# Halcyon Speaker Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](/rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](/rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](/compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), member of the Magaambya of conversant rank

You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells (see Halcyon Spells on page 100). In addition to being able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you also gain a 1st-level halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the halcyon speaker archetype.
