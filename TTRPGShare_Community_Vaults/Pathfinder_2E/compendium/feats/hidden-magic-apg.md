# Hidden Magic  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](/rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](/rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Arcana](/compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](/compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](/compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](/compendium/skills.md#Religion); [Vigilante Dedication](/compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md)

You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations.

A spellcaster using [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) or [read aura](/compendium/spells/read-aura.md) must succeed at a [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against your [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC to see through your obfuscations.
