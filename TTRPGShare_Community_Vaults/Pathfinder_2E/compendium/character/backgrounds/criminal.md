# Criminal
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 61*  

As an unscrupulous independent or as a member of an underworld organization, you lived a life of crime. You might have become an adventurer to seek redemption, to escape the law, or simply to get access to bigger and better loot.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Stealth](/compendium/skills.md#Stealth) skill and the [Underworld Lore](/compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Experienced Smuggler](/compendium/feats/experienced-smuggler.md) skill feat.
