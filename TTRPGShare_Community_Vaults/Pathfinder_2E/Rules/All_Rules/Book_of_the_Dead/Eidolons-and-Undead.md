# Eidolons and Undead

**Source**: Book of the Dead pg. 36

An eidolon and summoner link together via life force, which undead lack. [Undead](../../../Traits/Undead.md) spirits often have an easier time manifesting on their own than sharing a link with a living creature. Dhampirs and other creatures with [Negative Healing](../../../Bestiary/Abilities/Negative%20Healing.md) have a much easier time bonding with an undead as an eidolon. It might be more uncomfortable and unlikely, but an undead eidolon can bond with any living creature, and the connection to the living grants them unparalleled freedom from the cravings and weaknesses of undeath.
