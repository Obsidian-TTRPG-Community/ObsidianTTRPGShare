# Setting Triggers
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 305 3.0

If a spell is meant to respond only to certain events or under certain conditions—such as magic mouth—it might require you to set a trigger. This is a simple sensory cue that causes the spell to activate. The spell activates as a reaction when the spell’s sensor observes something that fits its trigger. Depending on the spell, the trigger might be the presence of a type of creature, such as “red-haired dwarven women,” or it could be an [Observed](../Conditions/Observed.md) action, such as “whenever someone enters the spell’s area.”

Disguises and illusions fool the spell as long as they appear to match its parameters. For a spell to detect something visually, the spell’s origin point must have line of sight. Darkness doesn’t prevent this, but invisibility does, as does a successful Stealth check to Hide (against the spell’s DC). For auditory detection, line of sight isn’t necessary, though the sound must be audible at the spell’s origin point. A Stealth check to Sneak can fool the sensor.
