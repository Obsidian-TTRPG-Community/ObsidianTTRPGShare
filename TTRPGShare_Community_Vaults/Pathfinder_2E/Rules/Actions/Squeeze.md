# Squeeze
==[[Exploration]]== ==[[Move]]==
**Source** Core Rulebook pg. 241 4.0

You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain that you can move through more quickly and without a check.

- **Critical Success** You squeeze through the tight space in 1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
- **Success** You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
- **Critical Failure** You become stuck in the tight space. While you’re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.

## Sample Squeeze Tasks
**Trained** space barely fitting your shoulders
