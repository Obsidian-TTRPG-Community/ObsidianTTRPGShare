# Learn a Spell
==[Concentrate](../../Traits/Concentrate.md)== | ==[Exploration](../../Traits/Exploration.md)==
**Requirements.** You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition’s spell list.

---
You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a cleric with the bard multiclass archetype, you couldn't use Religion to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.

To learn the spell, you must do the following:
- Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
- Have materials with the Price indicated in Table 4–3.
- Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the DC on Table 4–3). [Uncommon](../../Traits/Uncommon.md) or [Rare](../../Traits/Rare.md) spells have higher DCs.
If you have a spellbook, Learning a Spell lets you add the spell to your spellbook; if you prepare spells from a list, it's added to your list; if you have a spell repertoire, you can select it when you add or swap spells.
