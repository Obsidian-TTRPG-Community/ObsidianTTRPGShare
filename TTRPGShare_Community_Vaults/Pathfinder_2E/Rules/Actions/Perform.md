---
When making a brief performance—one song, a quick dance, or a few jokes—you use the Perform action. This action is most useful when you want to prove your capability or impress someone quickly. Performing rarely has an impact on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers—or even change their attitudes—if the GM sees fit.

**Critical Success** Your performance impresses the observers, and they’re likely to share stories of your ability.
**Success** You prove yourself, and observers appreciate the quality of your performance.
**Failure** Your performance falls flat.
**Critical Failure** You demonstrate only incompetence.

## Sample Perform Tasks
**Untrained** audience of commoners
**Trained** audience of artisans
**Expert** audience of merchants or minor nobles
**Master** audience of high nobility or minor royalty
**Legendary** audience of major royalty or otherworldly beings
