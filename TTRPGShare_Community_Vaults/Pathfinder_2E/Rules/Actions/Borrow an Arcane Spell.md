# Borrow an Arcane Spell
==[[Concentrate]]== ==[[Exploration]]==
**Source** Core Rulebook pg. 241 4.0

If you’re an arcane spellcaster who prepares from a spellbook, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else’s spellbook. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell’s level and rarity; it’s typically a bit easier than Learning the Spell.

- **Success** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.
- **Failure** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can’t try to prepare this spell until the next time you prepare spells.
