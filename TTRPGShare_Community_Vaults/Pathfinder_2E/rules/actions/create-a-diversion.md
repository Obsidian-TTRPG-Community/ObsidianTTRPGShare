# Create a Diversion (basic) [>](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[mental](/rules/traits/mental.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 245*  

**Skill** [deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Single Action

With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the [manipulate](/rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the [auditory](/rules/traits/auditory.md) and [linguistic](/rules/traits/linguistic.md) traits.

Attempt a single [Deception](/compendium/skills.md#Deception) check and compare it to the [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You become hidden to each creature whose [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC is less than or equal to your result. (The [hidden](/rules/conditions.md#Hidden) condition allows you to [Sneak](/rules/actions/sneak.md) away, as described on page 252.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except [Step](/rules/actions/step.md) or use the [Hide](/rules/actions/hide.md) or the [Sneak](/rules/actions/sneak.md) action of the [Stealth](/compendium/skills.md#Stealth) skill. If you [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md) a creature, the creature remains [flat-footed](/rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against that attack, and you then become [observed](/rules/conditions.md#Observed). If you do anything else, you become [observed](/rules/conditions.md#Observed) just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
> - **Failure** You don't divert the attention of any creatures whose [Perception](/compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.
