*Source: Core Rulebook p. 156*  

**Class** monk
- **Activity**: Single Action

Make two unarmed [Strikes](/rules/actions/strike.md). If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the [Strikes](/rules/actions/strike.md) normally. As it has the [flourish](/rules/traits/flourish.md) trait, you can use [Flurry of Blows](/rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md) only once per turn.
