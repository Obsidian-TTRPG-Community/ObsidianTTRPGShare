You duck into a safe position or minimize your profile while reloading to make your next attack. Either [Take Cover](/rules/actions/take-cover.md) or attempt to [Hide](/rules/actions/hide.md), then [Interact](/rules/actions/interact.md) to reload. As normal, you must meet the requirements to [Take Cover](/rules/actions/take-cover.md) or [Hide](/rules/actions/hide.md); you must be [prone](/rules/conditions.md#Prone), benefiting from cover, or near a feature that allows you to [Take Cover](/rules/actions/take-cover.md), and you need to be benefiting from cover or [concealed](/rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to a creature to [Hide](/rules/actions/hide.md) from that creature.
