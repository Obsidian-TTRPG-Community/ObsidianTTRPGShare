- **Trigger** The target of your [Exploit Vulnerability](/rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md) uses a [concentrate](/rules/traits/concentrate.md), [manipulate](/rules/traits/manipulate.md), or [move](/rules/traits/move.md) action, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Requirements**: You're holding your First Implement and Esoterica|Thaumaturge|DA|weapon|DA|1||weapon implement and are benefiting from [Exploit Vulnerability](/rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md) against a creature. The creature must be within your reach if you're wielding a melee weapon, or within 10 feet if you're wielding a ranged weapon.
- **Activity**: Reaction

Your weapon senses a moment of weakness and guides your hand to strike down a foe. Make a [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature with your First Implement and Esoterica|Thaumaturge|DA|weapon|DA|1||weapon implement. If your attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the triggering action. This [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md).
