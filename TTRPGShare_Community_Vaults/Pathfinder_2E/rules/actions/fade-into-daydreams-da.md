- **Activity**: Single Action

Your flights of imagination spill into the real world, causing you to become indistinct, hazy, or cloaked in figments. You become [concealed](/rules/conditions.md#Concealed) until the start of your next turn. This concealment can't be used to [Hide](/rules/actions/hide.md), as normal for concealing effects that leave your location obvious.
