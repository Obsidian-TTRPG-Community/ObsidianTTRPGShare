# Adjustment  
*Source: Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar p. 133*  

Items with this trait alter existing pieces of equipment, typically armors, shields, and weapons. A given adjustment notes which type of equipment it modifies, and a piece of equipment can only be affected by a single adjustment at a time. Unless otherwise noted, adding or removing an adjustment takes 10 minutes of work and a repair kit.
