# Improved Grab [F](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

The monster can use [Grab](/rules/abilities/grab.md) as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack. A monster with [Improved Grab](/rules/abilities/improved-grab.md) still needs to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it already has [grabbed](/rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).
