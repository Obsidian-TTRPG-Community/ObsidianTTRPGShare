# Bone Missile [>>](/rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

The skeleton yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin. The skeleton loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md). This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the skeleton's other [Strikes](/rules/actions/strike.md) has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to that [Strike](/rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1).
