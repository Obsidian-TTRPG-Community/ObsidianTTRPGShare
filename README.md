# Obsidian TTRPG Share

This is a repository for the downloading and sharing TTRPG elements that may be useful for **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** TTRPG Users. We also utilize this repository as a headquarters to plan community building and philanthropy.

## New as of May 2023
The Obsidian TTRPG Share is now a part of the new Obsidian TTRPG Community. Carry On!

## New as of April 2023

Sluggification and Title Chasing has changed!

**Old:** `Without_Numbers/Templates/Character-Sheet.md`

**New:** `Without-Numbers/templates/character-sheet.md`

## Goals / Mission Statement

The ObsidianTTRPGShare now maintains the primary goal of Encouraging the collection and categorization of data shared on **[Obsidian Discord](https://discord.gg/obsidianmd)** that would otherwise become lost and forgotten over time.

Its secondary goals are to act as an incubator for refining those elements, so they may be added to the **[Obsidian TTRPG Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+TTRPG)**.
