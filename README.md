# ObsidianTTRPGShare

This is a repository for the downloading and sharing TTRPG elements that may be useful for [__Obsidian__](https://obsidian.md) TTRPG Users. We also utilize this repository as a headquarters to plan community building and philanthropy.

## New as of January 2023

To facilitate the rapid changes happening in the community and to make content as easy to find as possible, the repository has switched it's structure.

__Old:__ `Type of Content -> TTRPG-System`

__New:__ `TTRPG-System -> Subtype (If Applicable) -> Type of Content`

## Goals

The ObsidianTTRPGShare currently maintains three goals:

1. Encouraging the collection and categorization of data shared on [__Obsidian Discord__](https://discord.gg/obsidianmd) that would otherwise become lost and forgotten over time.
2. Act as an incubator for refining those elements so they may be added to the [__Obsidian TTRPG Hub__](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+TTRPG).
3. Serve as a space for identifying and growing in-need TTRPG communities who lack adequate resources within the Obsidian Community through our [__SRD-to-Vault__](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/issues/4) Conversion Project.
4. Maintain a [__Master Resources Wiki__](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/wiki) of quality resources for TTRPG players and Game Masters that coordinate well with Obsidian.
