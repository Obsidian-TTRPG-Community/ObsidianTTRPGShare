# ObsidianTTRPGShare

This is a repository for the downloading and sharing TTRPG elements that may be useful for **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** TTRPG Users. We also utilize this repository as a headquarters to plan community building and philanthropy.

## New as of April/May 2023
To facilitate the rapid changes happening in the community and to make content as easy to find as possible, the repository has switched its structure.

**Old:** `Type of Content -> TTRPG-System`

**New:** `TTRPG-System -> Subtype (If Applicable) -> Type of Content`

---

Additionally, Top-Level Folders maintain Title-case and have been moved to Dash-slug formatting. Sub-folders have been changed to lowercase and dash-slug formatting.

**Old:** Without_Numbers/Templates

**New:** Without-Numbers/templates

---

## Goals

The ObsidianTTRPGShare currently maintains four goals:

1. Encouraging the collection and categorization of data shared on **[Obsidian Discord](https://discord.gg/obsidianmd)** that would otherwise become lost and forgotten over time.
2. Act as an incubator for refining those elements, so they may be added to the **[Obsidian TTRPG Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+TTRPG)**.
3. Serve as a space for identifying and growing in-need TTRPG communities who lack adequate resources within the Obsidian Community through our **[SRD-to-Vault](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/issues/4)** Conversion Project.
4. Maintain a **[Resources Wiki](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/wiki)** of quality resources for TTRPG players and Game-masters that coordinate well with Obsidian.
